Has a young child ever come up to you alone and asked for help? How did you react, and what did you do?
I kept digging through the rubble afraid of what I would find under the remains of, what used to be this familie's makeshift home, made from garbage. Homes like these, not up to codes, because codes don't exist in the town of Waiaula, a slum town, that used to be one, of six districts populated by the descendents of ancient Hawaiians within the Waiaula district in the City and County of Honolulu, Oahu Hawaii. The little girl who led me into this half demolished “do it yourself with whatever treasure you find at the dump” was actually in somewhat better shape than most of the properties in this 

Oh god. I am a kind person. I’m obsessed with helping children. I’m especially obsessed with ending child sexual abuse. The U.S. is one of the leading producers of child “porn” in the world. I’m vexed by the unheard cries of those children. I have taken needy people into my home before and I’ll do it again. But yes. There was a time when a kid asked me for help. I wish I’d understood. I had just gotten divorced. My first husband was a nice, troubled man. In general, he was sweet. But sometimes, when he was emotionally overwrought, he slapped me. Simple as that. When I left the ex, I went to Holl 

Donavin, carlitos and the little chinese girl. She was five years old and in daycare. I first saw her outside the day care building on 26 and 9th ave in Manhattan. She was alone and crying and I asked her what was wrong. She did not answer so I looked around and heard noises from inside a building with an open door. I walked in here with the girl in tow and asked if they knew her. A lady came up looked at her and said : yes... but she can not stay here any longer because her mother has not shown up to pick her up on time twice in a row so she has to go... we are not responsible for her.! I co 

This occurred several years ago, before mobile phones were as commonplace as they are today. I would have done things differently today. I was walking in my residential neighborhood on Easter, if I remember correctly. I was just heading home when this tot between 2–3 years old just seemed to appear from nowhere in the grass verge between the pavement and the street. I rushed towards him and managed to turn him away from the road. I asked him where home was, where Mummy was, and didn't get answers, but he did turn around and start walking back towards where I'd first seen him. I was terrified to 

Two occasions although the children didn't specifically ask for help. The first time was about 25 years ago, not long after Jamie Bulger was kidnapped and killed. I was shopping in a busy mall and this little boy, aged about 7 or 8, was practically hugging the wall and sobbing. All the other adults just walked past him, either not seeing him or ignoring him. Well, I can't leave a clearly distressed child to sob on his own, so I went up to him to see if he was ok. He told me he'd gotten lost from his dad. I told him it would all be fine and took him into the nearest shop. I was a regular in this 

Funny I should see this question tonight because it just happened to me today. My two daughters had just finished their ski lessons and I was nearing the door to one of the change rooms to bring them in. Standing near my daughters outside the door was a boy a little younger than my oldest daughter, perhaps 8 years old, East Asian, like me, which is probably why he spoke to me. He told me that he couldn't find his dad and was going outside to find him. Now, this is the time when we are all finishing up and changing our kids out of their rental equipment, so things are a little chaotic. He wasn't  

Yes, and it was a frightening experience! My daughter and I were shopping for school clothes, as were thousands of other parents and their kids. He was about 5 or 6 years old; I could see that he'd been crying, but was trying to get himself under control. He said he couldn't find his Mommy, and would I help. My first thought was to put my arms around him, but I forced myself not to. I smiled, put out my hand, told him my name and asked his. He told me his name was Little Guy. I asked where he lost his Mommy; he pointed toward a large chain store and said he thought it was there. Knowing there was 

About 5 years ago, I went home for the weekend to visit my mother. She lives in a 9th floor apartment in Toronto. She was away for a couple of hours and I was prepping for my classes for the upcoming week. In the middle of an assignment, I was distracted by the sound of a crying child. At first I thought it was coming from one of my mom’s neighbours. Out of curiosity, I opened the front door and stepped into the hallway. A few meters away from our door, a little boy was crying and looking around. He was about 3–4 years old and seemed quite disoriented, not to mention scared. He tried to open the 

Brea was a 5 year old neighborhood girl that would come to our house early in the morning. Like early. Like knocking on the door at 7am. Her words, “My mom wanted to know if I could come play at your house.” Brea lived around the block from us with her part-time mom in an upstairs apartment. Her mom had five other children that had already been “unfairly taken away” from her because her ex-husband was “remarried to a lawyer”. Sometimes mom would walk to our house in the evenings with shaking hands and a coffee mug in her hand. Sometimes the mug smelled of alcohol. On occasion we would sit on t 

I’ve had a few. The most recent one was too young to ask for help. It was about 2:30am and I was at a service station on a motorway, miles from anywhere. I had stopped for fuel and whilst filling up another car that was on the forecourt pulled off. As they did so I nonchalantly glanced up, in a world of my own whilst pumping fuel and noticed a small child, naked and covered in faeces standing in the dark on the edge of the forecourt over beyond where the car had been. He didn’t seem at all bothered or distressed and was quite happily just wandering about picking at the grass and stuff. I looked

Feminists calling every person who supports men’s rights a misogynist. “You misogynist, chauvinistic pig!” How many men must have heard this? It is a common sentence that gets thrown at men a lot of times whenever they try to discuss the issues they face. Apparently, the term isn’t just reserved for men. There is a rising trend on Quora where ANY person who speaks up in support of men’s rights or decides to disagree with feminism is called a misogynist. I only realized this trend when I voiced my support towards men’s issues. For all the butthurt feminists of Quora, here is the definition of misog

A week ago, I went to a photo studio to have a headshot taken. It was a little crowded so I had to sit and wait for my turn. A teenage girl came in wearing the traditional shalvar kameez along with a hijab. She looked like she was around 14 and she came with her father who was wearing the traditional dress as well. I suppose they had a reservation because their turn came first. The photographer told the girl to settle down while he set his camera. The girl took off her hijab and let down her hair. She was combing her hair when her father came storming in and told her to cover her head. The girl 

The fact people are willing to become ignorant and cruel just to defend an ideology. I think, contrary to many opinions, most people are actually good. At least, they stick to their morals. I saw this story about a girl getting raped in Pakistan as a pre-accorded revenge, in which her own family agreed. The girl could have ran away, yet she stayed. Her family could have said no, but for some reason, they didn't. Most of the individuals involved probably share a mindset, a sick mindset, but that doesn't mean they don't have the capacity to love or to feel. Still, what they did was horrible and d 

I get annoyed over little things although I hide my emotions well… When I greet someone with 'salaam alikum' and they don't reply back the proper way. Yes it happens.

I get so frustrated and angry about this but I keep quiet. Stop being embarrassed. I say it because usually I feel down and saying it and hearing a reply makes me feel better.Fake friendliness. One of the things I hate the most. I'd rather be mistreated than have people pretending 

Women claiming they want equality. It frustrates me to no end.  Instead of going on yet another diatribe, I’ll give a short explanation as to why this is definitely not what women should be asking for: Women can get pregnant, and when they do, they need time off to focus on their labour, and also time to recover from the pregnancy. They (and the child) also need the support of a man at that time. In most countries, men are not recognized for that role and don’t get time off, or at max about 2 weeks off. You really want us to start treating women the way we treat men?Although possible, due to phys

One of the things that frustrates me is the constant assertion that children who aren't smacked are not disciplined. Proponents of corporal punishment are under the illusion that all those of us who choose not to hit our children instead let them run wild, unchecked. They couldn't be more wrong. Yes there are some parents who either through laziness or ignorance don't discipline their offspring. Some even make a conscious decision to not instill any discipline at all. Ever. The “n” word (no) is a no-no. They think the child must learn to negotiate life through their own trials and errors. No rul

“Not all men.”  Sarah Everard, a 33 year-old woman went missing while walking home in South London. She was found dead on March 12, just a few days later.

She did everything right.  And it still didn’t save her. The level of victim blaming around Sarah Everard is disgusting.

What is the sneakiest thing you did to get back at an awful neighbor? Did you get caught?
Alright, darn it. Another check-mark on my “Hell Application”. I expect this will earn some deserved Quora-hate. Here we go. Years ago I camped with a girlfriend on Hermit Island, Maine. Beautiful place; well preserved nature on a rugged coastal island. Well spaced camp sites among the stunted coastal forest, quiet, water teeming with sea life. Family run and family friendly. Splendid, charming place. You drive there across a tidal flat as long as the tide isn’t high. We loved it so much, we kept extending our stay for new nights. Well, Hermit Island is popular and booked well in advance. This mea 

“What is the sneakiest thing you did to get back at an awful neighbor? Did you get caught?” It was when I was in university and the awful neighbours were the guys on the floor above ours in residence. The guys on the third floor had been a problem for the whole first semester, frequently coming down randomly to the second floor with buckets and throwing water all over the second floor, getting our beds, clothes and of course books and notes wet, then running upstairs and locking their door to us before we could react. This had happened every few weeks for months and we were getting sick of it. Bu 

This happened back in 1992- when I was 9-years-old and about to go to the fourth grade. I remember it being the last week of my summer vacation- as school would be starting the following Wednesday. That even was on the day my parents took me to meet my new teachers- as I would be having a man (for the first time ever) for math, science and social studies. The other teacher was an old woman I would have for language arts- spelling, reading and English. I heard she died just a few years ago after it happened. This family who had two sons that were "real troublemakers" lived just down the street f 

Not my proudest moment…. But in my 20’s: There were five or six guys, foreign Univ. students, living below me in a condo complex. They took all the parking including mine with new Porches, Lambos, etc. These cars would last maybe two weeks. First you’d see a dent, then a bigger dent, then the car would disappear and be replaced by another new one in a different color. I didn’t really care, but they hung out on the stairs every day and would not let me pass to get to and from my vehicle. They’d pinch my arms and grab at me, saying stuff I can only assume wasn’t nice. The landlord didn’t care, he  

I purchased a house in Hot Springs, AR in 2010. When my wife and I went to look at the house a man from the house next door came over to chat. He said that he’d seen us on his security camera and, since he knew the house that we were at was vacant, he just wanted to make sure that everything was okay. We explained that we were meeting the realtor to look at the house and he began telling us about the area. The realtor pulled up as we were talking and the guy returned to his house. The realtor didn’t seem to like the guy but we didn’t think anything of it even though it wound up being a red fla 

I have to admit there are two occasions. First one was after I moved to a new town in the UK and was living in a decent enough suburb of a large town in West Sussex. At the time I owned a VW Passat estate (station wagon) it was a pewter or metallic grey color. Very nice car. One morning I come out to find it had been scratched from one end to the other, in some places down to the metal, I was livid. A neighbor saw me examining the damage and told me it was done by the two kids who lived at the end of the close, their mother couldn’t bear anyone having a better car than them, they owned a ten yea 

I’m not a vengeful person so I’ve never done anything to retaliate against even my worst neighbor (who was a drug dealer, wife beater, &amp; attempted murderer), but I did get some sense of schadenfreude from karmic retribution. He had a major heart attack &amp; they had to cut him wide open leaving a huge scar. He also developed Parkinson’s and has been too unwell to come around and steal from me anymore. I also made sure the police knew his correct address (he kept fraudulently listing mine so they would come around harassing me &amp; trying to intimidate me thinking he was hiding in my house). I also go 

What is the sneakiest thing you did to get back at an awful neighbor? Did you get caught? Two stories. Neither of which involved me, and both of which may be considered only peripherally connected to the question. But here goes anyway: A company (that I will not name) occupied one or more sections in a long, continuous building made up of a large number of identical sections. They had a meeting room on the first floor (second floor for Americans), immediately below the roof void/loft. A planning meeting was taking place when the site engineer/maintenance man came into the room and whispered to the 

When I was young I had a lawnmowing business that required me to have equipment and fuel ready to go in a trailer parked around to the side of our house. As gas prices started to skyrocket during the 1970’s energy crisis, several times I got to my job sites, unloaded my equipment and prepared to fuel them with the gasoline in my cans only to find… nothing: they’d been emptied while on my trailer. After several frustrating repeats of this, I mentioned it to my father who had been a B-17 mechanic and flight engineer during WWII. He mulled it over, grinned slightly and said, “I’ll handle it.” He m

It was filled with aquatic plants and bullfrogs. Oh, Dick loved his bullfrogs. “They make such sweet music,” he said. No one else agreed - our bedroom windows all faced the

Some thoughts: Leave a note detailing where you are going at your home or in your motel/hotel room if you are planning a day hike.Also, leave a similar note in your vehicle when you get to your destination. And make certain that you stick to the area where you stated that you would be.Pay attention to the local weather reports. Any chance of rain above 30% should be assumed as being rain. When/if you are hiking and it begins to rain, head back to your vehicle immediately. Do NOT assume that it is "going to stop soon."Always buy a map of the area where you'll be hiking.

What was the point where Trump 'crossed the line' for you?
I'd heard of this bloke called donald trump who was hosting a show called The Apprentice in which he got to deliver a two-word tirade. I ignored both the man and the show. That was until in marched 2016 and from that point forward in no particular order, trump evoked a cascade of casual insults, flung from the protected distance of a Twitter account, a radio show and a campaign platform. trump, the presumptive Republican chosen one for president: corrupting, generic, impersonal, performed. The first line he crossed was the moment he painted himself into a corner: He never would catch up on his pr

When I was in High School, I had a few friends whose parents worked white-collar jobs in the construction industry.

Trump crossed all sorts of lines long before he decided to run for president: Trump was a bully as a boy and was sent to a military academy after his father caught him with a collection of switchblades.

For me it was without any doubt…… THE CORONAVIRUS! During the election I supported Trump as I felt like he would stop the rise of China (although he didn’t actually do so it was the Coronavirus that stopped it), even when he said “grab ‘em by the p—y” in that video I still supported him over Hillary. It started to go downhill soon after the election and when he told people in “Upper New York” to go to Wisconsin I started to see him negatively.

What was the point where Trump 'crossed the line' for you? Back in the late 70s, trump emerged on the scene. A seeming billionaire and real estate tycoon. In reality, he was nothing more than a mere smarmy misogynistic ‘playboy’ wannabe who demanded to only be seen with ‘tens’ on his arm. He walked over and ruined others just to get his, with absolutely no empathy or remorse. The epitome of dog eat dog. He truly reveled in being cutthroat. Apparently trump had money, so therefore he (and others) believed that he was entitled to have whatever he wanted and was also entitled to act like a pig. Only  

I had vaguely heard of the Trump family over many years. It didn't impinge on me much because I felt the participants and fans of his TV shows had to be idiots and therefore deserved what they got. After several bankruptcies I decided that anyone who did business with him was an idiot and deserved what they got. The moment I learned he was running for POTUS I had what turned out to be an inflated idea of the integrity of the GOP and of the intellect of many US voters. I was sure he would not get through the primaries, and then he did. I was sure they were not stupid enough to vote him in, and th 

What was the point where Trump 'crossed the line' for you? If by ‘crossed the line’ we mean ‘did something inexcusable’, then I’d say it was this: In 1984 (Yes, that long ago!) a cabinet builder called Edward Friel Junior accepted a contract to build furniture for a casino. The estimate for that contract was $400,000 - even more by today’s money. The contract was duly completed and the furniture installed at Harrah’s Trump Plaza location. Did he see that money? Hell no. He got $86,000. That’s about 21% of what he was owed. This massive shortfall basically destroyed his company. He was not alone.  

Q: What was the point where Trump 'crossed the line' for you? As best as I and a friend can date it, it was probably in 1985 or 86 when Donald Trump first appeared on our radar. 35 years later the specifics of the news or ‘public interest’ or entertainment program are lost to memory, but Donald Trump as a thoroughly repulsive and repugnant and totally self-interested human being was obvious even then. In neon. Over the years, Trump would only rarely re-appear on the radar, with the exact same response every time. It was obvious and palpable and visceral.

I went over to IHOP with my girlfriend, and got $55 dollars worth of food. When we got the bill, and everything, I gave the young girl a $20 dollar tip.

I was told that I would be informed about the problem on the phone after the internal parts were checked. I left. After a while, I got a call from the shop saying that because of humidity one part is not working well. It has to be replaced at X price. As an Indian, I asked him if he coul 

Nothing is safe in this digital world!!!!!!!!!!! I repeat nothing. Let me tell you a very interesting story. For 3 days, I searched various online sites such as Flipkart, Amazon etc., looking for a wireless speaker. Here’s what shocked l me today. When I opened my Facebook account, as I scrolled, after every 4 to 5 feeds, have a look at what is popping up on my news feed. This Ad is from Flipkart. But I am very surprised because I created my Flipkart account using my phone number. So, how on earth did this happen?  The next one is from Myntra. I have never, ever, created an account on Myntra.

This:  Imagine you’re at a conference meeting, 100 floors up in a gorgeous skyscraper of NYC, and it’s just like any other day. Actually, no, it’s not; the sky is utterly gorgeous and completely clear. Bored, you stare out of a window and admire the view. You do this for a while until suddenly, you hear a loud crash that’s followed by black, billowing smoke. Immediately, you and the others in the meeting get anxious and really concerned about what’s going on. You call 911 and ask them to help. They say that they’re on their way. As you and your coworkers wait… the situation just gets worse. People

However, as the edition writes Daily star, Mikey always felt that something was wrong with him. Since childhood, he was interested in women’s clothing and accessories. At the age of 13, he declared himself gay. However, later he began to think that he was probably transgender, and he needed to officially change his gender.

Is Noah's Ark a farce, or did it truly exist? Can you prove or disprove it?
Q: Is Noah's Ark a farce, or did it truly exist? A: Neither. It is mythology. What’s more, it is mythology that the Israelites stole from the Babylonians while in exile – and they stole it in turn from Akkadians. Q: Can you prove or disprove it? A: First of all, a global flood never happened – not in the timeframe of the Bible or history or palaeontology, anyway. The timeline of events places the Flood at 2348 BCE, and there is no gap in archaeology at that time. Most civilisations seems to have not been affected at all, like for instance the Egyptians, although there is a legend from China about 

Is Noah's Ark a farce, or did it truly exist? Can you prove or disprove it? The Bible story is seriously false. However Noah existed and survived a flood. He has told us he has no idea how the Bible story came about. Can I prove this? I can prove the medium who received it exists and is a genuine decent honest guy I have known 20 years. He can provide his audio tape and I can claim to have been the one who triggered Noah at this particular point in time. That’s as far as proof goes. Oh by the way the Urantia book published in 1955 and which this medium I refer to has never read, has a not too d 

Original Question: Is Noah's Ark a farce, or did it truly exist? Can you prove or disprove it? The biblical story of Noah’s Ark is a myth, plain and simple. It’s not even an original myth either, being an adaptation of part of a much older myth which originated in Mesopotamia over a thousand years earlier - The Epic of Gilgamesh. There’s no part of the biblical story, or the characters in it, which has any evidence to support it, and a flood of the scale described is an utter impossibility for multiple reasons. See Noah’s Ark and a Flood of Absurdities for some further information on this. Howeve 

I cannot prove that the Biblical flood story occurred as written. It is pre-historic, there is no possibility for direct evidence after so many thousands of years, and indirect evidence is open to many interpretations. There are two commonly-quoted falsehoods about it. “The Genesis story is copied from the Epic of Gilgamesh”. No; anyone who is sensitive to motive &amp; narrative devices can see that differences are immense. Other than the fact that both have a god, a man, an ark and a flood, there is little similarity. Consider the differences! Why was the flood caused - different. What were the mot

Noahs Ark is on Mount Ararat in Turkey and though it has been known about for millennia it was recently revealed to the world by video. Previously it was aerial photographed in the 1960s. In addition, there is documentation from the 1800s from people who have visited it. The references to civilisations such as Sumeria and Egypt having stories about the Ark actually supports the existence of the Ark. Ruins have been found in Turkey that predate those civilisations at Gobekli Tepe and elsewhere. To have those stories in not only Sumeria and Egypt but also in many other cultures confirms that the  

There is no evidence of a recent, worldwide, “great” flood that covered the tops of mountains and killed every human and animal on the planet except for the crew and cargo of one amateur floating zoo. And plenty of cultures, including the Egyptians who lived virtually next door, have continuous records of occupation before, during and after the times attributed to the “great” flood. Now sure, any god or God or gods worthy of His or Her or Their omnipotence could have easily made it happen and then created massive amounts of credible evidence that it did not happen. But then you have to wonder w 

It’s just a legend. It was nothing more than a small event that grew larger with every telling. We don’t even need to debunk the silliness of the claims of the ark or the animals aboard it. We have a very good understanding already of the world largest floods, including their causes and magnitudes and the biblical flood never occurred. Research shows us that the two largest floods in human history were the Altai flood in Russia and the Missoula Flood in the United States.[1] They were BIG floods. Really big. But they are insignificant when looking at global scales. Hell, we don’t even need to pro 

“Is Noah's Ark a farce, or did it truly exist? Can you prove or disprove it?” It’s likely to be an exaggeration rather than “existing” as described or not existing. In the Tigris-Euphrates area where the story seems to have originated, floods spreading as far as they eye could see will have happened occasionally. Those who witnessed them had no way of knowing if the flood covered the entire world as we see it but it certainly covered their entire world. Someone who was wise-enough, or lucky-enough, to have a bigger-than-usual boat (probably a boat of reeds) might have managed to rescue a couple o 

It’s mythology, a wholly fictional story, and it can be easily disproven. So floodwaters covered the entire surface of the planet to the height of Mount Everest? That’s 8,850 metres above the current sea level. The highest tree line - the height above which plants cannot grow - is 4,400 metres above sea level. Coincidentally, that is in the Himalayas. So, every single plant on earth would be under a minimum of around 4,400 metres of salt water. Do you know how far sunlight can penetrate sea water? At most, 200 metres. So, according to the mythology every plant on earth was in total darkness for t 

I have no difficulty accepting that in response to a major flood, an enterprising goat herder and his sons rapidly hurled together enough of a raft to save himself, his family, and their best breeding stock. And that when the floods subsided, his return to his devastated community was greeted with joy, and his saved stock rebuilt that community. He and his likely many descendants may well have risen to prominence, and become the leaders of that community, which prospered, and revered him and his actions. Further, that as the ages past, his exploits became the subject of myth, and like all good m

How does one justify owning a weapon? Why do you need it?
“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” -Edmund Burke I can justify my weapons because other people have them. I have no intention of ever using one of them to commit heinous acts. But every now and then. When things go bump in the night; I pull it out and walk around the house with it because I don't know who or what is out there.

My first ever martial arts instructor is a sweet and caring woman, but she said something that stuck with me till this day. I’d rather have ghosts and nightmares than maggots and worms.

My people have used everything from guns, spears, knives, and swords to defend themselves here (although guns are the go to weapon). Would you rather let yourself or your loved ones die or do you want the tools to take action? Tho 

The nice thing about civil rights is that you don’t need to justify their exercise to anyone. The fact that the right exists is all the reason you need. I don’t need to justify why I own weapons - or which weapons I own - any more than I need to justify for whom I vote, or which religion (if any) I chose to follow, or what books I read, or what alcoholic beverages I chose to drink, or what businesses I patronize, or what family planning methods my wife and I use, or what we do together in the privacy of our bedroom. Those all fall under the heading of “things that are none of your damn business. 

If you have anything you don't need, such as an extra pair of shoes, a second shirt, a motor vehicle, more forks than people at your table, a TV, a computer, a cell phone, or anything else, you have no business asking that question. I have a lot of things I don’t need because I want them, and can afford them, and that is all the justification I need. I don’t know whether I will ever need a fire extinguisher, but I have a few of them because if the need arises, there will be no time to acquire one. Some people never need a spare tire, but if they are stranded with a flat, suddenly they need one.  

How does one justify having a fire extinguisher (I have never had to use one), or life insurance (I haven’t died yet). It is better to have it and not need it then need it and not have it. A second reason, I love martial skills. I studied Tae Kwon Do because it was a good skill to learn. I haven’t had to be in a fight yet. I love to shoot, it is enjoyable. If you do not care for firearms, that is your right. I do not own a 300+ horsepower vehicle, don’t need one, it doesn’t mean that other people shouldn’t own them even though people have died from their misuse. I do not smoke, people die from s 

One doesn’t because one doesn’t NEED to justify owning a weapon. Why I need it is none of your business. I don’t HAVE to justify my actions or needs to you. The only time I need to justify my needs or actions is AFTER something has gone sideways. It’s called due process. My question is, why is what I own any of your business if I’m not harming you? I don’t ask why you need rubber sheets, barb wire, Kool Whip, and a live chicken…it’s none of my business. Just like why I need a gun is none of yours. 1.5K views · View upvotes1566James Chant, former Retired Private InvestigatorAnswered March 25, 2021 · Author has 748 answers and 338.1K answer views

I don’t pay all that much attention to other countries, but here in the USA there is no need for a lawful American Citizen to “justify” owning a weapon. Like the rest of our Constitutionally protected rights, no justification is required to exercise the right to keep and bear arms. Why we “need” it is evident in all of human history. The protected right to keep and bear arms insures that I can protect myself, my family, my community, my country, and most of all my liberty… from all enemies foreign and domestic.

Well, not to be a wise a**, it come down to an American Freedom. If you don’t want to own a weapon, don’t, but don’t sh*t on my right to own one if I want or need to.

What disturbed you today?

Would you shoot a burglar whose intent is only to leave with your valuables?
The problem with this question is it’s rooted in moral idealism and not reality. How can you know a person’s intent? And even with intent was known with 100% certainty, do human actions always mirror intent exactly? Have you ever been caught up by emotion or distracted and unintentionally done something? You can’t go down the rabbit hole of this type of thinking and even if it led somewhere productive (which it does not) you certainly can’t expect someone to in a matter of a few seconds. You must put yourself in the situation. It’s easy to be Monday morning quarterback. A person has violently ente 

100 answers ok, I’ll bite Chances are in this day and age if all they are interested in is your valuables they will enter your home when you aren’t there. Why take a chance getting shot? So the answer is I come home, and WISH, he (The Burglar) tried when I was home. But I can’t shoot him. By then its too late. Here is what a typical “Burglary Crew” operates. They picked broad daylight in a nice neighborhood when the owners were at work.  You see his fellow accomplices moving around in the background. Here is another crew caught in the act. Its grab and go. If you want to k 

If I had the opportunity to, here in Australia we gotta keep our guns in a secure safe, unloaded and bullets removed from all magazines. Getting to the safe, unlocking it, getting a round or two out of the box and into a magazine and loading the weapon takes time, time I can’t afford to waste with a burglar. I can neither confirm or deny I used to keep a loaded pistol in a concealed location but I’m looking after my little sister now and she’s a sneaky little shit that I know rummages through stuff, and if she found something I may or may not have hidden I know she’d use it improperly or to lo 

Going directly to murder mode with respect to a person who you have somehow divined is only interested in thieving your junk would be a disproportionate reaction and likely prosecutable in some jurisdictions. It’s one of the many, many reasons why guns are terrible home defense tools. So, if you come downstairs and you just see a guy jumping out of your window with your jewelry chest under his arm, it would be inadvisable to do any shooting, both morally (a human life is worth more than your damn jewelry, you monster) and legally. In practice, however, people aren’t psychic, so it’s rare to eve 

 Do I look like a betazoid to you? No? How about god.  Still no? Thought not. So tell me, how am I supposed to know that A) the burglar is only interested in my possessions and B) she’ll flee as soon as challenged, rather than stab or shoot me? I’m actually asking. Do you have some way for me to know? I thought not. Now, let’s go through some risk analysis. Situation 1: She will indeed run as soon as challenged. If I do nothing, no risk to me. If I shoot her, no risk to me. Situation 2: She will injure me when challenged. If I do nothing, significant risk to me. If I shoot her, minor risk to me. Situati 

No, but only because I don’t know if I could shoot anyone. I’ve never had to do it, and I think I might choke under the pressure. Do I think I should be willing, were I able, to shoot someone who was stealing my valuables from me, but not going to do anything else at that time? Yeah, and let me explain why. Even if I have some magical power that lets me know this without fail, the thief is still doing me harm by stealing from me.There is no guarantee letting him leave won’t result in further harm.Let me unpack that second one. Think of someone like my family when I was growing up. I grew up on a 

Someone who I do not know has decided that my home contains things of value that they want. They are willing to break the law, violate my boundaries, and criminally enter the place where my family and I live in order to obtain things that they value, simply because they want and chose to do so. Do you know what inside of my home is most valuable to me? The lives of my loved ones and my own life. Do you know what comes a distant second on the list of things that I value? The sanctity and safety that our home represents. Much further down the list are the items within my home. Above my value for  

Absolutely I would. His intent might be to kiss me goodnight. He could even say that. But he’s someone who is in my house uninvited. I don’t have a clue as to what his real intent is. His intent might be to leave with my valuables (as if). Maybe he really intends to leave with my valuables and not be identified. Why would I not believe him, considering that if a cop stopped and asked him what he was doing just before he got in he would tell the cop he was only burgling, right? Right. See where that leads us? On top of it, I suspect that breaking and entering, which the burglar would have to do (mo 

This question has so many loose ends (rightfully so because in the moment nobody pauses to ask questions or read minds!) - so I’m going to see it in the black and white sense. YES, I would shoot any individual breaking and entering and thieving, let me tell you exactly why; Number one, is the burglar armed? (a homeowner may not be able to see a concealed weapon). We all have to assume the weapon, even a knife is present. Number two, is this individual under the influence? (This may not be apparent but it can indeed make a fairly innocent looking burglar snap or react - doing the unthinkable- eve 

This question keeps coming up. Apparently all prior answers weren’t good enough so it gets asked yet again. Please tell me how I can read the mind of someone so out of touch with reality and legality he chooses to invade my home? If you can tell me how to read that deranged mind, maybe my answer will change. Right now I have to prepare for the worst, that he intends to do a lot more than simply steal my stuff. There is another way of looking at this. Presuming I have the right to live, I therefore have the right to defend my life. Right? I have invested a good number of hours working to be able t

Princess Diana: Alienated from the royal family and estranged from her husband, the picture below was captured in 1992 when she was seen leaving for Egypt, a year described by the Queen as the most horrible.  In 1996, the couple agreed to divorce but she was killed in a car crash a year later, together with her Egyptian partner Dodi Al Fayed. The few seconds before the crash were captured on camera. On the left is her bodyguard who looks panicked:  Trapped in the wreck of the backseat, she was still breathing as the paparazzi gathered around snapping pictures instead of calling the ambulance.

Question: What's the saddest celebrity moment ever caught on camera? Answer: Stephen Robert Irwin (22 February 1962 – 4 September 2006), nicknamed "The Crocodile Hunter", was an Australian zookeeper, television personality, wildlife expert, environmentalist, and conservationist. Irwin achieved worldwide fame from the television series The Crocodile Hunter (1996–2007), an internationally broadcast wildlife documentary series that he co-hosted with his wife Terri. The couple also hosted the series Croc Files (1999–2001), The Crocodile Hunter Diaries (2002–2006), and New Breed Vets (2005). They also

Back before Bieber got all the tattoos and grew out his bangs, he and Gomez were the ultimate young power couple. However, there was definitely trouble in paradise.

The story goes that the two were running from the paparazzi when Gomez was punched  

On Tuesday August 16, 1977 a 42-year-old morbidly obese man was found on the bathroom floor of his house, totally unresponsive and in a strange frozen “seated position.” Some time later he was pronounced dead, at the Baptist memorial hospital. That man was Elvis Presley.  For most of his career, he had been the most famous person in the world. His fame was only paralleled by one — and only one — music band in the world (4 young boys from Liverpool called “The Beatles”). Once a very beautiful man, in the last years the trainwreck his life had become had treated him badly, and he did just about the sa 

I’ve always thought the last image taken of actor Marlon Brando leaving a car going to the hospital was sad. Brando had grown morbidly obese over the years and was, in his final moments, barely able to walk — he was pushed around in a wheelchair most of the time…  Now Brando had been, in his younger years, one of the most devastatingly handsome men ever to grace the silver screen. He had been all muscle and marvelously sculpted perfection, a Greek God come to life… but he was a man who suffered extreme moodswings and, at times, great depressive episodes. His greatest comfort by far was food. Eve 

When I was 18, I worked as a summer camp counselor in a very wealthy gated community where a lot of celebrities lived. I grew up in LA and definitely have had my fair share of celebrity run ins, but when I worked at this summer camp, I met more celebrities than I ever had in my life. Eddy Murphy, Kelsey Grammar, Derek Fisher, Will Smith, Jessica Alba, and many more. And, of course, Britney Spears. Britney Spears would occasionally come to the club house (where we usually spent most of the time at for the summer camp) to go swimming. I’m not quite sure why, I’m sure she could have had her own pr 

What made you forbid someone from ever entering your home again?
What made you forbid someone from ever entering your home again? It was many years ago. I had a friend who I now realize was either borderline or narcissistic (to the level of a disorder). But back then, in the early 1980s, I just tried to cope with her weirdly manipulative behaviors. Finally, I had to put a boundary in place when she tried to rope me into coming along and sneaking into the home of a guy she’d been dating. She was planning to soak all of his valuable inherited silver pieces in an extremely strong salt solution to force him to have her over to help him clean and restore it—!? Thi 

I have a friend, I’ve mentioned her before as my promiscuous friend. I’m not judging anyone who decides to choose that path, but the way this girl has demonstrated herself was less than desirable in this household. The first big thing about her was in the summer between our 7th and 8th grade year, my family invited her along with us on a trip. She was very much grateful for this since she never left our home state much. We were preparing for this for months. The night before we left, she was texting a few guys back and forth and they were asking for nudes. Only reason she didn’t send any back w 

I am clean and sober over 42+ years. Despite an upper middle class background and the best of schools, I decided to forego pursuing advanced education and degrees and instead learned most of my knowledge, by trial and errors on the streets of New Orleans and New York City with a bottle in my hand and pills in my pocket. Many times it was society’s lowest of the low, the homeless bums, prostitutes, junkies, and, winos that were my teachers and mentors. They taught me survival tricks, street smarts, and how to stay clear of the 3rd rail. I loved those dear folks. When I hit a very low bottom and  

My eldest is nearly 19 and autistic. He's not very experienced at relationships. He brought his first girlfriend home at 17 and she seemed like a nice girl. She lived an hour away and he doesn't drive so I would pick her up and bring her to our house for the weekend. Everything seemed great. However I started to have misgivings about the relationship. There were lots of red flags. Including the fact that he told me when he stayed at hers because she liked to drink (perfectly legal in your own home at 16 in the UK) and he has always been anti drinking (even now he's never even sipped alcohol an 

-PROLOGUE- So many answers already and oh boy.. This question seems made for me. Technically I could say there is two or so times I banned someone from my house — one was a cleaning service —but I'll go with the one, the person, that was most emotionally draining. Warning: it is super long. It's unfortunate my last name is tied to this, I do hope there is not any backlash on my family or the community I live in. But I'm not about to go anonymous on this. I have no reason to. If anything it might make people more aware. Before I've written briefly about having a family member addicted to drugs. Th 

Let’s go back to 2009, when I was still in high school. I will repost a story I did on Reddit a while back. All names will be changed for the purpose of this answer. Before I begin, I just want to give you a short answer and say that I banned my ex friend from my household right after these events took place. She basically betrayed my trust and stole from me blatently. Also for the disgusting bullying she did afterwards. Anyway, this ex friend in high school was in foster care. We'll call her 'Bonnie.' Thing is, in the beginning when we started getting to know each other, 'Bonnie' was only just p 

My best friend I've known since I was 5. She's currently homeless, pregnant, has a one year old and 9 year old twins. Finding out she was recently made homeless, I decided to let her stay until she could get a job, find a place, etc. Lasted only 5 days, until my first night off (I work nights, so I usually sleep all day and pretty much just lock myself in my room) and about midnight I realize my cigarettes are missing. I lose stuff a lot, so I wasn't too worried but I wandered around the house looking for them. After the first 15 minutes of not finding them I started really digging because even 

It was a summer morning, some holiday (possibly July 4th?). My parents were over visiting, we had a reasonable number of beers and were discussing politics. The neighbor showed up (out of the black of night) and asked if he could join. No problem - we pour him one and ask him what he thinks of Erdogan (the Turkish president; it was right after he allowed a coup in his country, suppressed it within hours then put every bit of resistance down to school teachers in prison). The neighbor says something indistinct - not just ‘not into politics’ but also fairly drunk. Oookay, it’s a holiday, as long 

The only person who I have banned from my home is a friend of my partners (I am a 37F, and he is a 35M. The friend is a 28F). We live in a very small studio apartment (20 square m) and she has been to our place before. It s a long read, but TLDR at the end. We have been together for four years and in that time, she is the only person who I have not taken to from his friends and family. When I first met her, she was polite but seemed a little upset or sad about something, the second time, she didn’t contribute to the conversation and was a mute the whole evening. I noticed, that my partner only  

I genuinely liked my son’s best friend, Ben. For a seven-teen year old he was remarkably eager to please and warm hearted. I secretly hoped one of those qualities would rub off on my somewhat apathetic son. When I overheard Ben telling my son he was looking for a summer job I knew that I’d found my guy. I offered him $500 a week to clear out the brush and brambles in the overgrown pasture at the edge of our property. He agreed on the spot, smiling so wide during dinner that peas kept falling out of his mouth. Ben started a week later. He worked five hours a day, often in the hot sun, without com 

Has your child’s teacher ever made a remark in class that you felt was inappropriate and unnecessary?
Not my child’s, my own teacher when I was a child and I felt it both inappropriate and unnecessary (it also made me very, very sad, as I was an emotional little kid). I suffer from a heavy chronic illness my whole life (well, since I was two). It affected and affects everything that I did and do, which was especially sticking out when I was a kid. I was that child who can’t do PE, isn’t allowed to ride a bike (even though I learned before all my peers in the kindergarten, so it hurt even more to be forbidden to do it), isn’t allowed to eat ice-cream or drink hot tea, isn’t allowed, isn’t allowe 

Unfortunately, yes. My two sons looked very much alike as children. My elder son applied himself, was respectful and got good results. My younger son was often told, “you’re not like your brother”, not because he wasn’t as respectful but he had a less serious approach to life. He wasn’t disruptive. Because they looked the same, too many people expected him to be the same. I was a Special Aide at the time and something’s in the double unit my younger son was in. One day, after school, a teacher was marking work and bellowed in disgust. She’d spent six weeks teaching, or rather lecturing, about  

Unfortunately yes, but luckily I was able to hear it first hand and record a portion of the exchange and act accordingly. Where I’m from my kids are doing virtual learning due to Covid. My son is in Grade 3 and was doing his schooling with a teacher that was having a lot of difficulty adjusting to the online environment. She was always very impatient with the majority of students. The specific incident occurred when there was a missing link on my sons homepage so he couldn’t complete the worksheet, and he asked his teacher for help. I am just going to copy the email I wrote to the teacher and S 

Like some of the others here, this isn’t about a child of mine, but rather me To preface, this took place my senior year at a vocational school (listed in my credential), as far as the school itself, I elected to go there my junior and senior years and don’t regret it, and still to this day look at my time there fondly, most of the teachers have been great and overall I just loved being a student there At this particular school, we had to wear uniforms with our lab logo on them, so you could tell what lab a student was in just by looking at their shirt, there was the option of staying a half day 

Yes, twice. Here are my stories: I used to attend an Islamic school that provided students with time to pray the evening prayer if they choose to, and on fridays (the holy day for Muslims, kind of like sundays for Christians) they provided extra time for the Friday sermons. These sermons are religiously mandatory for men who have come of age, but remain optional for women if any age for reasons I will not go into today, though I encourage you to do your research. Anyways, because if day-light savings thing, the girls classes (boys and girls were separated in this school) ran while the boys clas 

Unfortunately yes. When my daughter was in Prep, she had this teacher who seemed to be grumpy all the time. For context, this teacher was thrust into a full-time arrangement for a term after enjoying a part-time mode for sometime, because the other teacher went on maternity leave. When the end of semester reports came out, I didn’t think my daughter did too badly considering our circumstances at the time. My husband was flying in and out for work and I was struggling juggling everything else at home. So, when I said “thank you for her report, it wasn’t bad as I thought”, her response was “real 

Yes and I ended up going to the school board about it. My oldest is now 12 but when she was in grade 1 she was a very sensitive little girl. She just started a new school, had a new baby brother so there was a lot for her to process. Well due to her being so sensitive a lot of the kids in her class teased, bullied and made fun of her. One day her teacher told her that if she wasn't such a crybaby they wouldn't bully her. Now if it had been said when no students were in class I might have just spoke to the teacher about the inappropriateness of what she said but since it was in front of the ent 

Yes. The first time or two, I disregarded her sarcasm. My son had said on a couple of occasions that she met questions about the assignments with eye rolls and a “REALLY??” But the straw that broke the camel’s back for me was when she met his excuse note (he was late because he had an earache) with an eye roll and, “oh WOW.” I am a teacher myself, and believe that parents should talk to the teacher if they have a problem—not to the principal. So I did. I called the teacher and said, “My son said that he asked (this) and you rolled your eyes. Was he being disrespectful to you, and he left that o 

I was the kid. Back to school night, 8th grade. Parents come in and meet the teachers and get the general gist and workload of the classes. I went my mom since she didn't qanna leave me home alone. We went to my math teacher's classroom. I hated that bitch so much. She was so bad at teaching and never explained or helped anyone, gave us tests without warnings, was generally mean to every poor kid in her classes. I was sitting next to my mom in a chair. I was kind of hiding behind her, because my old best friend and her mom were there. I didn't want to see them, she dumped me in the trash a year  

Not my child’s teacher but myself as a teacher. Why? Because I am human with normal human interactions and normal human reactions. In our daily lives, we often say unnecessary and or inappropriate things. How often don’t we regret something we had just said? How often don’t we wish to bite our tongues because of this? I am not saying that teachers must not be held to a higher standard. Of course, we have to be held accountable for what we say- after all, we are speaking to very precious beings, the young and impressionable. They are easily wounded and their self-esteem can easily be destroyed. S 

What is the rudest thing someone has done to you or someone else in first class on an airplane?
What ignorant thing did a car salesman do or say that made you walk out in the middle of a negotiation?
I must admit i am a great Land Rover fan, I learned to drive in my grandfather’s 80″series one, on a farm, my very first vehicle was a 109 series 2a Safari, which I kept for 25 years before I went to part exchange it for a new SWB County with coil springs . . . and here the story starts. Year 1997, I walked into the Land Rover dealership near my home and told the first salesman I saw that I was interested in buying a new Land Rover. We sat down and after telling me that they would not be interested in a part exchange he asked me if I had anything specific in mind, I said yes, a 90, fitted with a 

A couple of years ago I found what I thought was the perfect Mustang. It was a 2016 GT with a modified exhaust. I’ve always loved the sound of the 5.0 liter V8. After a test drive I was hooked and decided to buy it. A fair sale price was negotiated and we began to fill out the paperwork I should have known something was up when the salesman asked me to sign an “intent to purchase” before we started any of the other paperwork. As we did the paperwork I saw the total price start to skyrocket with the addition of heretofore unmentioned “extras”. One of these extra expenses was something called an “ 

I’ve three times been car shopping with my partner, and each time the salesman immediately started talking to me. Even after explaining that I was not the buyer or decision-maker, I still was the focus of their “pitch”. The absolute worst example was at a large national chain of used automobiles. My partner had recently been involved in an accident which totaled her 2012 Audi Q-5. She loved that car, and it was a perfect ride for her. Since she wanted a replacement, we looked around for the same year, make and model. Happy to find one in a nearby city, we took a drive about 1.5 hours down the r 

 It wasn’t what happened to me as opposed to what I witnessed. It was one of my clients I provided security services for about 10 years ago. She wanted to buy a brand new car from a dealership. She asked me to set it up for her with an appointment to go in and actually purchase the car. I called ahead to explain to the salesman exactly the kind of car she wanted, the options that she wanted, and that she had the money. I told him this was a serious offer and she just wanted to go in for the formality of signing the papers and leaving a deposit to get the ball rolling for the car to get assemble 

In late 90 or early 91, my mom had a Ford Taurus that was nothing but trouble. (It was the 1988 model). She had called me wanting me to go car shopping with her. No problem. We went up to Wilmington (DE) to look for something she liked. (The dealers in Dover didn’t exactly have great reputations.) We went into a Toyota dealership by the airport. Looked around the lot for a few minutes before being approached by a sales person. This guy wasn’t exactly the roll model for sales: scruffy looking. She takes a Camry for a test ride. Liked the car. It had a little more than her minimum requirements. So 

Not one crooked thing, the lying sack of sh*t tried several, all based on the assumption that I didn’t know any better. I was in the market for a BMW 3 series and visited the Ingress dealership in Damansara, Malaysia. As ill luck would have it, Gary Yeo walked up to me. 1. He was pushing his pre-registered vehicles. Whereas a “new” vehicle lacks plates and owner until it is registered to you at the road transport department (equivalent to your DVLA or DMV) with your choice of plate number, a “pre-registered” vehicle has been registered to someone else first and technically is yours second-hand,  

Typical narcissist, pushy sales person. I quickly disliked him upon informing him up front we were doing our initial shopping, our current vehicle wasn’t off lease for a few months. Ignored that completely. Of course he worked every angle HARD, trying to put pressure in front of my wife and I (she expressed mild interest in the upgraded seats, but only came in an elaborate package with nothing else she wanted), so he looked right at me, informing me I needed to “please the lady”, and “if she wants those seats, we can have them in the car for her”. Everything was “today, Today, TODAY”. I remind 

After passing my driving test I was shopping for my first car and my parents came along with me. I was 19 at the time. At the first car dealership we went to we were introduced to a car salesman who, for the purposes of this story, I will name Peter. Not his real name. Peter asked who the car was for and I told him it was for me and that I had just passed my test. I got the impression straight away that Peter felt it was beneath him to serve someone of my age. He showed absolutely no interest whatsoever in me and actually spoke more to my parents than he did to me. Even when he was showing us some 

Not a car salesman but a motorbike salesman. Some time ago I decided I had enough of paying for a car and public transport and would get my motorbike licence. Working in the CBD would mean having access to free parking for my bike and would make it easier and cheaper to get to work. So, off I trot to a local dealership that has a deal to cover your licence costs if you buy a bike. The sales guy there was fantastic, I had a particular bike in mind but didn't have a lot of experience with bikes so was glad that he was providing me with so much information and the pros and cons of each bike. Due to 

My Story: It was the last day of the month. Earlier that afternoon I had landed in the US from a flight from London, and so was a little tired. My wife and I wanted to buy a new car and would buy with a good deal at the end of the month. So we got a baby sitter for the hours required to buy a new car. We were shopping for a new Acura. After about 1 hour with the salesman, the salesman said “you’re not serious.” I don’t easily get angry…but that angered me. I calmly said, “We’re here today to buy a car. I had been flying all day. We paid for a baby sitter to be here tonight. And you’re telling me we

What is the rudest/most unusual/most obnoxious thing you have seen someone do at a wedding?
In Israel, there was a pretty young bride with thick dark hair, a contagious laugh and a bubbly personality. We’ll call her Malka (a common Hebrew name, it means ‘queen’). Three months ago she became engaged to a handsome, earnest and smiling Yeshiva student who we’ll call Yonatan (Jonathan). They were introduced by Malka’s cousin who studied in Yeshiva (Jewish college of Torah study) together with Yonatan. They were friends - for years they used to hang out together, sometimes studying Torah and sometimes just chilling with some good Israeli music and some good Israeli beer. He knew well from  

I went to a destination wedding 12 years ago in the Caribbean as part of a short vacation trip that I took. I didn't know anyone but my traveling companion and her daughter; the rest of the wedding party were strangers to me. The bride looked beautiful, the weather was great, and everybody got along. It was actually one of the best weddings that I had ever attended and I was happy that I was allowed to be a part of it. After the ceremony at the wedding dinner, the bride announced that she was expecting and that brought applause and cheers from everyone except one person. What I didn't know (and  

Many years ago when I first started dating my husband his older brother was dating a girl that I just wanted to distance myself from. Now many people will understand when I say that his older brother is the first born, male, and the family was Italian and German, so he could do no wrong. He’s a great guy and I love him, but I sometimes get weary of his elevated status no matter what. Ok back to the chick; my husband’s father must have had a little crush on her too because by association she could do no wrong either even though she was pretentious, insulting and thought she was the smartest pers 

You will have to decide who was the rudest person at the wedding I am going to describe. A few years ago I worked with a young lady who was rather shy. She was one of these people that always wanted to please everyone, and got upset easy. I liked her a lot but felt like saying, calm down! Anyway I was invited to her wedding. I hadn’t been to that church, but I had heard that the Pastor liked to hear himself talk. I didn’t know what to make of that statement, but I sure found out! The service started out nice, it wasn’t a very big wedding, maybe 50 people. About half way through the service befor 

Going anonymous, so as not to embarrass a couple of the characters who are still living. My dad remarried in 2000, and he wanted to have a big, fancy reception for family and friends. It was held at a very nice location downtown. Drinks were readily available to those who might have wanted to imbibe, and at events like this of course there's always someone who does…. My dad had invited a neighbor-lady from across the street to come, but instead her 40-something son, whom we'll call “John”, and his date showed up. I recall him arriving with a big smile on his face. In no time, he was tossing down 

In the late 70s, I was invited to a what turned out to be a fairly fancy and expensive wedding reception. The lady (let’s call her J.) and I were early into our relationship, so I was aware that I wouldn’t know too many of the other guests. That would be a bit of a problem because J. was a member of the wedding party, and we would not be spending much of the evening together, not even at the same table for dinner. The Bride’s parents had really laid it on for their only daughter - the City’s finest Hotel Ballroom, tons of guests, excellent dinner, et cetera. All the guests were dressed up - the 

I was the maid of honor at my college friend's wedding. Everything went beautifully except for one moment during the reception. One of the first dances was supposed to be just for the wedding party; the groom with the bride, both sets of parents with each other, and all the attendants with their opposite-sex counterparts. While the dance was being announced, the best man - the groom's younger brother - slipped out and nobody could find him. He had ducked out of his own brother's reception just to avoid dancing one dance with me. I had only met him the day before, and we had barely exchanged a  

Didn’t (thank God) happen at any wedding I have been to, but I recall reading this one in the newspaper years ago when they published a collection of readers’ worst-thing-that-happened-at-my-wedding stories: Hands-down winner for me was one woman recounting her husband’s best man and (I guess) a close bud of the best man who was an usher as well. The two of them showed up to the ceremony already pretty drunk … it was all they could do to get these guys through it without too much disruption. Then came the pictures at some nearby park. Apparently they had brought along some flasks and renewed the 

Well, how about a string of things. I had major surgery 6 weeks before my daughters wedding. I spent my Six week recovery making the wedding and bridal party dresses and the last few days cooking for 200. My Dr. was pretty upset as I needed a second surgery. I had been in a roller coaster accident and he said that a sharp jar to my neck could sever my spinal cord. However, the wedding won. He gave me some heavy duty pain killers in case I needed them at the wedding. I had 6 oxycontin pills. I put them in my glove box just in case. I don’t take pain killers. I had a sister who was addicted to the 

I work as a wedding videographer so I’ve seen my fair share of obnoxious moments…but by far the most memorable one I’ve seen and heard was at a destination wedding I attended as a guest. The ceremony was perfect, the bride looked radiant—everything went without a hitch. During toasts, when it came to the bride’s older sister’s turn, she had a bunch of people roll up a projector screen in the middle of the ballroom. She started kicking up a fuss about why it was taking so long to set the whole thing up because the event planners were having a hard time connecting her laptop and project a powerpo

I kept digging through the rubble afraid of what I would find under the remains of, what used to be this familie's makeshift home, made from garbage.

Oh god. I am a kind person. I’m obsessed with helping children. I’m especially obsessed with ending child sexual abuse. The U.S. is one of the leading producers of child “porn” in the world. I’m vexed by the unheard cries of those children. I have taken needy people into my home before and I’ll do it again. But yes. There was a time when a kid asked me for help. I wish I’d understood. I had just gotten divorced. My first husband was a nice, troubled man. In general, he was sweet. But sometimes, when he was emotionally overwrought, he slapped me. Simple as that. When I left the ex, I went to Holl 

Donavin, carlitos and the little chinese girl. She was five years old and in daycare. I first saw her outside the day care building on 26 and 9th ave in Manhattan. She was alone and crying and I asked her what was wrong. She did not answer so I looked around and heard noises from inside a building with an open door. I walked in here with the girl in tow and asked if they knew her. A lady came up looked at her and said : yes... but she can not stay here any longer because her mother has not shown up to pick her up on time twice in a row so she has to go... we are not responsible for her.!

This occurred several years ago, before mobile phones were as commonplace as they are today. I would have done things differently today. I was walking in my residential neighborhood on Easter, if I remember correctly. I was just heading home when this tot between 2–3 years old just seemed to appear from nowhere in the grass verge between the pavement and the street. I rushed towards him and managed to turn him away from the road. I asked him where home was, where Mummy was, and didn't get answers, but he did turn around and start walking back towards where I'd first seen him. I was terrified to 

Two occasions although the children didn't specifically ask for help. The first time was about 25 years ago, not long after Jamie Bulger was kidnapped and killed. I was shopping in a busy mall and this little boy, aged about 7 or 8, was practically hugging the wall and sobbing. All the other adults just walked past him, either not seeing him or ignoring him. Well, I can't leave a clearly distressed child to sob on his own, so I went up to him to see if he was ok. He told me he'd gotten lost from his dad. I told him it would all be fine and took him into the nearest shop. I was a regular in this 

Funny I should see this question tonight because it just happened to me today. My two daughters had just finished their ski lessons and I was nearing the door to one of the change rooms to bring them in. Standing near my daughters outside the door was a boy a little younger than my oldest daughter, perhaps 8 years old, East Asian, like me, which is probably why he spoke to me. He told me that he couldn't find his dad and was going outside to find him. Now, this is the time when we are all finishing up and changing our kids out of their rental equipment, so things are a little chaotic. He wasn't  

Yes, and it was a frightening experience! My daughter and I were shopping for school clothes, as were thousands of other parents and their kids. He was about 5 or 6 years old; I could see that he'd been crying, but was trying to get himself under control. He said he couldn't find his Mommy, and would I help. My first thought was to put my arms around him, but I forced myself not to. I smiled, put out my hand, told him my name and asked his. He told me his name was Little Guy. I asked where he lost his Mommy; he pointed toward a large chain store and said he thought it was there. Knowing there was 

About 5 years ago, I went home for the weekend to visit my mother. She lives in a 9th floor apartment in Toronto. She was away for a couple of hours and I was prepping for my classes for the upcoming week. In the middle of an assignment, I was distracted by the sound of a crying child. At first I thought it was coming from one of my mom’s neighbours. Out of curiosity, I opened the front door and stepped into the hallway. A few meters away from our door, a little boy was crying and looking around. He was about 3–4 years old and seemed quite disoriented, not to mention scared. He tried to open the 

Brea was a 5 year old neighborhood girl that would come to our house early in the morning. Like early. Like knocking on the door at 7am. Her words, “My mom wanted to know if I could come play at your house.” Brea lived around the block from us with her part-time mom in an upstairs apartment. Her mom had five other children that had already been “unfairly taken away” from her because her ex-husband was “remarried to a lawyer”. Sometimes mom would walk to our house in the evenings with shaking hands and a coffee mug in her hand. Sometimes the mug smelled of alcohol. On occasion we would sit on t 

I’ve had a few. The most recent one was too young to ask for help. It was about 2:30am and I was at a service station on a motorway, miles from anywhere. I had stopped for fuel and whilst filling up another car that was on the forecourt pulled off. As they did so I nonchalantly glanced up, in a world of my own whilst pumping fuel and noticed a small child, naked and covered in faeces standing in the dark on the edge of the forecourt over beyond where the car had been. He didn’t seem at all bothered or distressed and was quite happily just wandering about picking at the grass and stuff. I looked  

What does Meghan Markle really want from the royal family?
Meghan wanted to be a Senior Royal, she expected to be up front with William and Catherine but she’s not a Senior Royal, she didn’t like having to curtsy to all of higher rank, she didn’t like having to adapt to the confines of the Family, she didn’t like the traditions, she managed to get Harry to change but she couldn’t get the rest of the family to change so she stamped her foot and walked out. In Canada, she expected that she would soon be back with the Family, under her conditions, that didn’t happen so she stamped her foot again and this time landed in LA. She still wanted things her own 

I think she wants fairness from the Royal family, the world makes up this blissful rendition of Royal life, that falls flat from reality. The courtiers make the rules and they seem to isolate family members and render their brains into mush. How many lives have to be destroyed before the RF circle the wagons and protect their own? Why couldn’t Prince Phillip have a military carrier and be a husband to the Queen? Why can’t all of the Queen’s children have important roles in the RF? Who cares if it diminished the major role of the king or queen, at least everyone would have access to funds and p 

In their Interview , they said Harry was cut off, and Archie didnt get a Title, remember she said Title first then corrected herself by saying its about Archie having security.  I believe Meghan wants Harry not to be “cut off”, and Archie to have a title before Charles becomes King. She used the word security but security means not just a bodyguard but can also mean Financial Security! I believe Meghan only equates Respect with having financial secuity. If this were just about having a bodyquard, I wouldnt see why they couldnt just hire one theirselves. They say they left cause Archie was denied 

Her way in everything! She wants all the royal trappings; she wants the grand houses, the titles, the money - everything. But she also wants to pick and choose what ‘work’ she does and turn up only when it suits her. On top of that, she wants SussexRoyal to be selling merchandise (of her choice) that will add to their coffers so she becomes richer than Croesus on the back of the RF. In addition, she wants to be a ‘celebrity’, able to jet off to make money from red carpet events, after dinner speeches and attending the best A-list parties in Hollywood and elsewhere (by private jet, of course)! And  

Attention. It really is all about attention. Anyone with half a brain who’s been following Meghan Markle for the past 3 years have actually noticed that all she does is to constantly try and get other’s to look at her. Compare her to the Duchess of Cambridge, you can easily the differences in attention-seeking behavior. It is a completely normal thing if you want to be a celeb. But she’s clearly going over the line now. Don’t get me wrong, I actually used to really like Meghan, until she showed her true colours. You can tell that she’s the sort of person who’s rude to others, and wants to be co 

Special treatment that’s what she wants. She doesn’t understand that since her son is so far from the throne that he doesn’t get a title. Remember she didn’t want to become a UK citizen after she married Harry that’s proof she never wanted to be a real part of the family. She shouldn’t have a title anyway since she isn’t a UK citizens she’s still an American citizen. If I was the queen I would strip them both of their titles and ban them. Harry has picked his side. He choose an outsider over his family and allowed that outsider tear his family apart. They won’t be together long. And if it’s ab 

H$M want to keep their salaries, titles, security, perks and work when and what charities they want to work from the USA. Since the UK is not around the corner, this is impossible. The UK does not owe the USA this type of service. They both resigned and walked away from their roles because they wanted to make their own money. It looks like they both forgot that detail. When you quit a job, you don’t get to keep your salary, insurance, and benefits for life. Their sense of entitlement is unrealistic. Meghan stated they lost so much. She lost her father.

She wants ,what any woman wants from anyone, RESPECT. She is Prince Harry ‘s wife and should be respected and treated as such,just like he is treated .Someone in the Palace should have made sure that she was treated with respect just like Catherine !

I don’t think she wants anything and I don’t think she expects anything. She’s been disappointed by her father, half sister, and her husbands family. She feels she has no one but Harry and herself. But she won’t be pushed into silence anymore, for all she knows she might be saving some other woman down the road from having to put up with the mean girls sorority she and Diana and Fergie went through.

What is the best case of “You just picked a fight with the wrong person” that you've witnessed?
Back in 2011, I was in China. On this particular night I was having drinks at a club. This was more of a high end private setting. I was with a couple guys, talking business, closing some deals. Most the clientele there that night was locals; rich business kids, business ‘wall street’ type, government officials, etc. Place was pretty packed, there was only one other group of 4 or 5 foreigners (to China); either investors or buyers from the US that was seated along one of the bars (behind me), where as we were at one of the raised tables like 10 feet away. As the night went on, they were drinking  

The “wrong person” the fight was picked with was me. The ‘fight’ was the result of many years of fairly intense bullying, from primary school well into the third year of high school, and it was only due to the martial arts I had begun to study largely as a result of the bullying itself that enabled me to be the “wrong person” for the bully or anyone like her to pick on for a fight. At primary school, when I was about 9 or 10 years of age, I was fairly close friends with another girl, named Helen, who would join me at recess and lunch breaks to discuss books we were reading, show each other our i 

My work friend was breaking up with her husband. They had booked a holiday to Spain. She asked me did I want to step in. As my boyfriend was a builder summer holidays were impossible as he did most of his work then. He would ski in Bulgaria in January. I don't ski. So off we went. Within the first few days Spanish lads had come to our neighbouring hotel and were fighting the British ones. The police arrived, someone had got thrown off one of the lower balconies and ended up in hospital. A few days later we were in a beer garden a crowd of British lads came in, started drinking heavily, singing r 

I'm sure I've shared this before, but it fits so perfectly here. As twenty-year-old students my best friend and I were thrashers (fans of thrash metal): army boots, skin tight jeans, band T-shirts, biker jackets, lots of hair and earrings, the full shizzle. Being a “sweaty heavy" was, apparently, an invitation for the “trendies" (The guys in the £100 designer shirts with wide-awake haircuts) to abuse you verbally and physically. A year or so earlier, my jaw was broken in an unprovoked beating by four guys who drove past me and thought it would be fun to turn round and come back to kick the cra 

While there were a few times I've seen some moron pick a fight with the wrong person and got hurt, the first one that comes to mind is quite mild. Not only was the attacker surprised by what happened, so was I. My surprise was a pleasant one, his not. Back in sophomore year at Stuck-up Prep School there was this girl (I’ll call her Sally) who skipped eighth grade and joined my freshman class. She was small and would have been considered the same even around those her own age. Having attended for three years (two with our grade) nobody really knew her very well.

I live in Thailand, which has a port of call, Pattaya, for foreign Navy ships and tourists. Nightlife is a big draw, with beer and karaoke bars, shows, foods and goods of all types and a thriving ‘entertainment’ business.

The city is well-prepared when Navy ships come in, with its police force working together with a group of foreign volunteers and ships’ military police (MPs).

In 2012, a Canadian conservative senator challenged future Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to a celebrity boxing match.

Not a physical altercation; rather a verbal one. Norm S. was the Program Director at the radio station where I worked.

Everyone knew it, but for the sake of peace avoided confrontation with this “little Napoleon.” Among Norm’s peeves was women who did not “know their place.” Peggy D. was an elegant woman, who hosted our classical music segment.

As a fan of K-pop, what makes you roll your eyes every time you hear it?
When people actually act as if the K-pop idols were Perfect and the idea of giving our criticism or pointing out a mistake were some anti behaviour.When people don't want to accept that the majority of K-pop idols from 3rd and 4rd generation DON'T SING LIVE. It's not hating pointing out that not even while being sat down or standing up they are still using autotune, corrector and/or the playback is so loud you cannot hear their actual voices.People not even able to(in my opinion they just don't want to) actually point out a HUMAN flaw in a group or idol, I get you liking someone despite of the

The things I’m about to say is just me saying things I’ve heard, seen, and experienced through when I say these. “This song is a flop.”This mainly targets fans who say a song that not only exceeds a certain amount of views, gets awards, gets on music charts, and is well-known, is a “flop” because it doesn’t fit their music taste. If a song doesn’t fit your music taste, it’s NOT a flop. Ignoring the successes the song earns and stating it as a “flop” don’t go together. “Why do you even like K-pop? You don’t even understand the language.”Just because I don’t understand the language, doesn’t mean th

Things that locals say that honestly amuse me: “I’ve never listened to K-pop because I know it sucks.”  Sounds like a you problem.

Even my 2 year-old has a better playlist than you.” You did that to yourself. “I thought you were too old for that crap.” Generalizing music and the age of fans because of the language of maybe one song you've heard?

“NON ASIANS SHOULD NOT BE IN KPOP BECAUSE ITS KPOP FOR KOREA” “ONLY ASIANS CAN AUDITION” As a Korean person, I have been seeing comments like this all day because it’s apparently a Big Hit Audition.

Either way, most of them are 100% foreigners who have probably never even set foot in the country. As a Korean, foreigners and non Koreans talking about Kpop like this makes my blood boil.

Just being left with the UK state pension, life got even harder for them. My ex husband bought them an old caravan, which they lovingly did up and it became their pride and joy. Their first holiday with it was only about 20 miles away from their home, but they were really excited to be getting away even though they had no spendin

She knew I wanted a wine rack as I had been shopping for one with her a few days prior. I worked this day and came home and she had bought me one. How thoughtful! I was unsure though if it was a gift or not so I asked her what I owed her. She told me $80!! Okay, more than I wanted to spend for something I didn’t pick out but I paid her because luckily  

My husband’s aunt not telling the rest of my husband’s family that my husband’s father’s parents (my husbands grandparents) had passed away, so she could gather all of the money before anyone else knew they had passed and started the legal processes.EDIT: I wanted to add another that I think is just as bad since I’m not sure how to make a 2nd separate comment on a post yet (if that’s possible at all lol) So here’s the 2nd stingiest thing I’ve seen someone do: 2. Another woman, a friend of my grandmother, (in her 50s if that matters) is/was so bad off on drugs and was living with her very elderl 

Early in my marriage, my husband told me that he’d be set for life because his parents were very well off (when his father dies, he’ll inherit close to a million dollars, as will his brother and sister). He’s a CPA who does his dad’s taxes and handles financial matters for him, and I’ve seen some of the paperwork, so I know that this is true. Both of his parents were Depression-era babies, as were mine. The big difference between the two sets of parents is that my parents decided early on that they would rather help out my brother and me while they were still alive so that they could see the di 

My mother always behaved like she was entitled to the best of everything, and thought the bare minimum was good enough as far as other people. She insisted on holding her husband’s paycheck as well as her own, deciding how the money would be used before he even had access to it. She’d say she was depositing both paychecks into the bank account, but actually she cashed them and spent the money as she pleased, then hid some in her purse for later, depositing whatever was left (if anything) when she was finished. I know that because she often took me with her. Bills often didn’t get paid, and when  

My ex-husband’s grandmother was a millionaire but she was the cheapest person I’ve ever met. As an example, one year, we went to her house for Christmas and were exchanging gifts. At the time, I was supporting my whole family because my ex was a deadbeat and we were just making ends meet. Despite this, I bought grandma nice gifts (around $100 for them), mainly because she was getting up there in age and I wanted to make sure she had a nice holiday. When it came time to give me a gift, she went into a back room and emerged with an unwrapped shoebox. When I opened it, there was a used extension

I’m from a family with 8 children with a tradition of getting together monthly at each other’s homes to share a meal and socialize. Once we all had significant others it was normal to have about 16 adults plus children attending. The person hosting would provide the place, the dinnerware and beverages and everyone would bring a dish to share. It was always a feast with most of us bringing at least one if not more items. My oldest sister, although she was always one to parade her success making sure we knew she was well traveled, had important friends and luxury items, was always the cheapest. H 

After my mother had back surgery, she had to walk 2 miles a day. Of course, she lives in the country and the weather doesn't always behave in Oklahoma. My aunt Kathy, her sister in law, had a treadmill that she hadn't used, but for a catch all, in so long, the dust was thick, and there were cobwebs. My uncle Jimmy, mother's little brother, knew she needed a treadmill and was going to sell it to mother, at a MUCH discounted price than if mother had to get a new one. Uncle Jimmy knew aunt Kathy hadn't used it in years, and thought she would be glad to be rid of it, get it out of the way. Oh no,  

As a fan of K-pop, what makes you roll your eyes every time you hear it?
When people actually act as if the K-pop idols were Perfect and the idea of giving our criticism or pointing out a mistake were some anti behaviour.When people don't want to accept that the majority of K-pop idols from 3rd and 4rd generation DON'T SING LIVE. It's not hating pointing out that not even while being sat down or standing up they are still using autotune, corrector and/or the playback is so loud you cannot hear their actual voices.People not even able to(in my opinion they just don't want to) actually point out a HUMAN flaw in a group or idol, I get you liking someone despite of the

The things I’m about to say is just me saying things I’ve heard, seen, and experienced through when I say these. “This song is a flop.”This mainly targets fans who say a song that not only exceeds a certain amount of views, gets awards, gets on music charts, and is well-known, is a “flop” because it doesn’t fit their music taste. If a song doesn’t fit your music taste, it’s NOT a flop. Ignoring the successes the song earns and stating it as a “flop” don’t go together. “Why do you even like K-pop? You don’t even understand the language.”Just because I don’t understand the language, doesn’t mean th 

Hearing it or seeing it, here are the things that make my eyes roll into the back of my head: On Youtube: “Fandom name here supporting kpop group” “Any *fandom name* here” “Who else came here because of kpop group” spam No one forced you to come and watch the video or asked what fandom you are part of in another kpop groups video. Like how are these top comments on youtube videos sometimes? Interviews: On the Oscar’s when the cast of ‘Parasite’ and the director were having their mini interview with the interviewer:  This is literally EXACTLY how I see most of these interviewers interview these kpop gro 

(I do not mean to sexualise any kpop idol) How can u listen to kpop, eww Ears, I make use of them They all look the same I am worried, get ur eyes checked He  Does not look like him  They r Chinese… right U r an alien right?! What do u think the k in kpop stands for. U don't even understand wht they say T R A N S L A T I O N. Moreover, music is not abt language… They look like girls Really?! How the shitting fuck do they look like girls to u. Pls go get glasses and no I am not gonna pay for them.  They r talentless Go hear EXO and Taeyon singing. Go hear BTS and Stray Kids rapping. Go look at Seventeen and TXT 

You can also call these my K-pop pet-peeves! They look like girls! WHAT ON EARTH!!! HOW COME THIS:  AND THIS:  LOOK LIKE GIRLS TO YOU!!! Like seriously! If you still think they are girls then you’re gonna gonna have to get your eyes checked out! You’re listening to those Chinese boys and girls again? Ummm…. yes? What’s your problem? AND FOR THE BILLIONTH TIME…… THEY ARE’NT CHINESE! HOW DO YOU MESS THIS UP!!!  They all look the same! Ok, I’m not gonna’ say much about this cuz when I was new to K-pop I thought the same thing…. BUT YOU DON’T EVEN KNOW THEM!!! HOW DO THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME TO YOU!!  DO U THINK 

Things that locals say that honestly amuse me: “I’ve never listened to K-pop because I know it sucks.”  Sounds like a you problem. (my turn to pick a song in the car, realize I've been skipped for a toddler) “I would rather listen to JoJo Siwa until my ears bleed than K-pop. Even my 2 year-old has a better playlist than you.” You did that to yourself. “I thought you were too old for that crap.” Generalizing music and the age of fans because of the language of maybe one song you've heard? No thanks bro. “They look like girls.” They don't really. It just sounds like you're running out of things to say to 

They all look same and are chineseI agree its not easy to distinguish at the first but it doesn't mean that they all look same and for god's sake they all are not chinese.How can you understand this language?First of all music is to feel, and why didnt you say this thing when everyone were boping their heads to Despacito and there is something we call Subtitles or captions . even if there aren't subtitles you can find lyrical videosThose idols don't even know that you existOkk this is true but saying this again and again really annoys meThey put on makeup especially male idols.So what?? if the

“NON ASIANS SHOULD NOT BE IN KPOP BECAUSE ITS KPOP FOR KOREA” “ONLY ASIANS CAN AUDITION” As a Korean person, I have been seeing comments like this all day because it’s apparently a Big Hit Audition. Such statements usually come from Non Koreans, who think they can decide about Korean matters because they’re Asian, or completely Non Asians individuals. Either way, most of them are 100% foreigners who have probably never even set foot in the country. As a Korean, foreigners and non Koreans talking about Kpop like this makes my blood boil. Why is it that you, a foreigner, a non-Korean, think that you  

God I have so many things: “Stan Loona/BTS/or whatever Kpop group” on videos unrelated to the groups or Kpop in general. You know that just pisses people off and turns them away from said group right?“Oppa I love you!” Or inserting random korean words in to full English sentences.When people say they use a Kpop idol’s real name because they feel closer to that idol. Umm really? Do you know them personally? FYI: I have nothing against people calling idols by their real name, but that reasoning just sits weird with me because, how do you “feel closer” to a celebrity who doesn’t even know you pers

From people who don’t like k-pop ‘why do you like these chinese men again’I mean some of them are chinese. But it’s clearly called K-pop. I don’t see a C squashed anywhere. ‘they look like girls’Damn, have you got your eyes checked recently? Being blind must be really hard. Could never be me. ‘they try too hard’Um okay, and you don’t so that’s why you probably still ask your mum to buy cookies for you. ‘their squeaky voices piss me of’You talking pisses me of. ‘they’re too skinny’Stop shaming people cause they’re skinny. Some of them are forced to be like this, some of them are naturally like

What is an example of a dirty trick that a thief tried but backfired when they saw your dog?
In the 1980s I lived in the middle of an older industrial area on the outskirts of a provincial city. You would think that means noise through the workweek, but peace and quiet in the night and weekends, right? Wrong! It was there that I discovered that after the offices close and darkness sets in another part of society takes over. Every single gate that wasn’t locked would be opened. Everything that could be moved would be gone. Drunk idiots would race through the abandoned streets. The cars of customers of the nearby streetwalking zone would look for quiet parking lots. Occasionally there would 

Well…I’m waiting for the day, but it hasn’t happened yet. Probably because I help several rescues with giant breed dogs. My 164 pound Pyrenean Mastiff, Rutger, is a guard dog like I’ve never seen before. Most dogs will bark or put up a good show. This dog will put himself in front of a stranger and he is deadly serious. He’s now THIRTEEN years old, which is truly amazing. He may not look like a serious force at this age but I have no doubt if anyone breaks in, he’ll kill them or die protecting me. Then I chuckle because we have agricultural land and have a huge group of dogs. Three to five sle 

I have 2 stories that come to mind. One involving a cat, and the other my doggos. This is long. I was owned by a wild feral rescue Norwegian Forest Cat that hated most 2 leggers most his life and would vanish, ie, somewhere they cant see him, when people were over. I moved to a very small college town and managed to get a great duplex for too good of a rent, but am a firm believer in my 2nd Amendment Right, and grew up pretty rough so figured I was okay. One night my boy started stalking my bedroom window and had a low growl I had NEVER heard!!! So I called the cops, who were mostly vets as well 

When I was a kid about 15 we lived in a suburb, neighbors’ houses close together. We knew the people on each side well. We had a wire fence down both sides of the property line with wood posts. You could see right through and barely notice the wires. Not sturdy enough to climb. Probably four feet tall. My brother could jump it. There was a couple who lived next door with her elderly mom who didn't speak English, she was Slovak and couldn't hear well. She was sweet; when I was little she braided my long hair. When I went to their house to learn how to crochet she'd smile and fall asleep while he 

Actually, I don’t know if it was a thief, rapist, murderer, etc. At the time, I lived on the third floor of an apartment building that allowed dogs. I had gotten a second dog about three months previously, and it was the first night she was not sleeping in her crate. At around 2:00 or 2:30 am, I woke to this low grumble that quickly escalated into the deepest, most spine-chilling bark I had ever heard. Mind you, she was an 11-month old collie with a normally high-pitched bark. If you know collies, you know the sound. My other collie and I crept into the living room, where she was standing at th 

I had 8 pitbulls at home in Chicago, the Mom was Baby and the Father was Philip, pluss the their pups who were almost 1 year old, they all looked similar, brindle with white patches, all of them were almost the same size and shape, I could tell them apart but no one else could. I always walked them separately on the same route. Anyway a new neighbor saw me walking Jitterbug and asked me how much I paid for her I said “nothing she's mine”, then he's starts trying to talk me into let his mixed breed cockerbull with her I said “nope I'm good,” and kept walking. Like every time I walked a dog he w 

We adopted a big, beautiful Great Pyrenees in 2003, right after moving into a new rental home in a sketchy neighborhood. I was working third shift at a warehouse, and was at work from 11:00PM - 7:00AM. I got home one morning, and found every light in the house on, my girlfriend sitting in the living room looking terrified, and the big white dog staring at the front door like he was thinking “Do something stupid again … PLEASE…”. If you don’t know the breed, do some research. 110# is small for a male. They are highly intelligent, and VERY protective of what’s theirs. Threaten what belongs to a  

When I was in graduate school studying developmental biology, I had a dog named Roland. He was a Doberman-Shepherd cross and he had a distinct dislike of people. Anyone could easily read this on his face, even without all the theatrics of teeth-baring and growling dogs normally have to display to get their point across. I used to take him with me to the bank ATM after hours to deposit my stipend check. Roland would sit behind me, watching the world with blood in his eyes, never making a sound. Others in line would stay back a good ways to give him plenty of room and no reason to take offense. H 

HEH… This wasn't a dirty trick in the traditional sense, but I rather consider a thief such as this one at least, trying to pull a dirty trick. Some years ago, this guy had hopped my fence where I used to live and was prowling around in my backyard. I had 2 old power wheelchairs, a mobility scooter, my snowblower and 2 bicycles I was working on chained up on my back porch under my awning covered with a tarp because I didn't have much room in my house and no shed. I'd never had any problems in all the years I lived there, but I guess this guy was somebody that maybe either knew one of my neighbor 

What is an example of a dirty trick that a thief tried but backfired when they saw your dog? Dog you say? Try cat instead… When my parents first married, they lived in an apartment block overlooking the Point Yacht Club in Durban (South Africa) This was about 45 years ago, it was a different time… B&amp;E and petty theft didn't call for the whole CSI team to be onsite like today. There had been a few break ins in the block, no one was quite sure what was going on, people/ their neighbours would find the front door open and some items missing, no sign of forced entry. My parents were out one morning and  

What do you immediately think of when you think of a totally disabled veteran?
What is one thing you accidentally taught your child that came back to bite you?
It was not me that taught my son this but was my first husband. When our oldest was 2 years old he thought it would be funny to teach him that the sound a sheep makes is, “Get away from me cowboy!” Instead of baaa baaa. We all thought it was funny and the joke died off or so we thought! Fast forward to when he was 3 1/2 years old in preschool. I get pulled into the daycare office by a very concerned director. They were learning the sounds animals make and my son had said a sheep says, “Get away from me cowboy!” and trying to keep a straight face I tell the director that I will handle it. She sa 

I'm the child in question, not the parent, but I imagine this is the first story that would pop into my parents’ heads. As a kid I really liked school, the learning part of it anyway, and I did really well. My parents were pretty used to me getting good grades. I'm not sure about other places, I imagine this is somewhat common everywhere, but a lot of kids in my class would get special presents if they got good marks on their report card. I'm not sure at what age my parents told me this, but I'm sure they repeated it a number of times: They were not going to be the kind of parents who bribed me t 

I was the child in this situation and I am pretty sure that my parents are pretty pissed at themselves for teaching this to me, but more than once has this saved me from seriously trouble. Le me start by giving a little bit of background. I was a big, plumpy kid when I was a child of about 7 or so. I moved to a new city as my dad got transferred to a metropolitan city from a small city. Now come day 1, the neighborhood I moved into was a bit 'bitchy’ to say the least. As is the rule from where I come, you always pick on the new kid on the block. Well, as you guessed it..I was the kid but the pro 

I'll let you decide if it came back to bite me or not. I guess I could see it either way. My daughter was being bullied in high school by a few other girls. More than once they ganged up on her, slapped her around, embarrassed her. The school wouldn't do anything but make excuses. So during summer break between her freshman/sophomore year I got her outside and taught her how to box. Gloves, punching bag, jumprope, the works. To be honest, I really didn't technically teach her how to box. I showed her how to get her wind up, protect herself, and taught her how to hit. How to punch through, to cou 

I didn’t know how to defend myself in school, and was socially awkward, and bullied, so I sought to avoid the same experience happening to my two boys. I started “fooling” around with them since they were in kindergarten. I would send a punch very slowly toward their heads and expect them to dodge or deflect my attack. It was just a game for them. As time went by and they began to understand that I was training them to identify attacks and defend themselves, I sped up. A few times, I was able to control both of my older kid’s arms with only one arm and had my other arm free to attack, so he as 

Nothing too extreme. My family taught me to walk away from confrontations, to laugh things off, to just move along. As a result, I didn’t know how to fight or defend myself. I got beat up and pushed around as a kid. It made me scared. When I became a senior in high school, I started to change that and to not be so scared. Over the next few years, I worked on myself physically. I got myself into good shape. I didn’t need to worry about anyone else. I laid some guy out who was on my ass. He would not stop. Finally, I had just had enough. He never bothered me again. I never had to deal with that l 

My hats off to the parent who taught their daughter how to punch!!! It always amazes me when a school administrator decides to get involved is only when the bully gets beat up. My comment on this is that maybe the school bully has something on the administrator that if presented, would make the administer lose their job, or something like that. Why else would a school administrator not want to get involved to stop a bully from harming other kids? Cowerdice? If that is a wrong assumption, then the only other reason I can think of is that the school administrator lacks a spine, and now they are  

My son was around 6–7 years old. It was on Ugadhi (Telugu New Year). On every Ugadhi we visit the cemetery of our ancestors and offer our prayers to them. We place new clothes, the deceased person's favourite food item, flowers etc. We were all around the mantap (small building) that has my Mister's grandfather's cemetery and next to it his grandmother's cemetery and there was a space next to it for his grandfather's another wife who was still alive.

Not my Child but my 7 year old cousin Sister who’s really close to me. And those who don’t know what can she do then please take a look at my answer. Geetak Milind Patil (गितक मिलिंद पाटील)'s answer to Does your family know that you write on Quora? I know it’s difficult to believe but this little creature is 7! She visits us frequently and many of the times we are close date partners! So day before yesterday when we were enjoying one of our such dates it was decided that it was Dinner time and we selected a nice posh restaurant for our dinner date! (She’s choosy par anything else!

Daughter came home one day and started her complaint. “My friend Ruju says that she eats her food while watching YouTube.” She said with her hand on her hip. “So?” “So why can't I do that?” I had wanted to shield her from these gadget-looking-while-eating fad that kids were going through. Not that she never watched an iPad or TV. It's just that I avoided such things while eating. “No.” “But…” “Anyway, we usually eat together. How would it look if Mumma and papa are eating and want to talk to you but you are concentrating on some cartoon?” “But it's fun to watch...” “That would be rude, right?” “What abo 

What was the turning point of your life that changed you completely?
My parents’ divorce I hesitated at first to put my response here because it got quite long and it is not nearly as exciting as some other responses that I’ve read. ButI still put it in here, because sometimes, even minor things, can form a big avalanche, which will in a more slow way change everything completely. About this time last year I was taking a break in between two badminton games when my phone rang and I saw “Dad” on my display. I knew immediately what it was about. My parents almost never call me except it was about something really important. Prior to his phonecall the relationship b 

We all have our own paths in life and my path is not the same as yours or anyone else’s. I believe that some people will have a fairly smooth journey through life with no major ups or downs. But, others will have a rollercoaster ride and won’t know which way is up sometimes. I think it is these people who are more likely to experience pivotal turning points, as they come out of one bad situation, into a good one. I have been through many turning points in my life; some good, some bad. I think the most pivotal turning point was a rare, chance meeting of a friend in a pub one evening. We knew of eac 

Well, I think there were some turning points in my life, rather than just one. However, let me write about one of them that made into who I am today. It was almost exactly 11 years ago. I suffered an accident, which I won’t go into details because I still feel bad remembering about it. What I can describe here is the moment when I was at the hospital. I was a bit conscious and my brain still have some flashes of that day, where I was, how I was being carried from one room to another one. I knew I would need a surgery or perhaps many of them. I still remember I was under some medications, which di 

When I just had turned 27 years old, I basically had settled. I finally had managed to convert my involuntary celibacy into VOLUNTARY celibacy! I have not been lucky at the genetic lottery and was not blessed with good enough looks that would entice any woman to develop romantic feelings for me. So it would be best to look for something else to do where I was actually good in. I was content at the idea of remaining a solo traveller for the rest of my life, and an up and coming cactus and desert expert. But a few days shy of my 28th birthday, I was not taking pictures of cacti at all. I was in a d 

On the 8th of October 2013, I experienced my first day clean after 15 years of chronic heroin addiction. In the week that followed, I experienced a perspective shift where my world completely changed. Below is a brief account of that life-changing experience: The race was over It was now the 8th October 2013 — four weeks into detox — and I received my last ever dose of methadone. In the week that followed, I felt a profound shift in my being, like my ‘spirit’ or ‘soul’ had been woken from a deep sleep. Words such as these had always confused me, but for the first time in my life, they made comple 

I’m going to write anonymously for this, and also please excuse my grammar, I am not in a good state of mind, i feel like I'm hyperventilating and I'm shaking. I can barley focus on what I am doing. It might be a bit long, so bear with me. Ever since I was in either first or second grade, I’ve always had to do these really strange things that would annoy me to do but I believed it was normal and didn’t think much of them. For example, when I was at school, before I threw away any lunch that my mom made for me, I had to kiss it. For some reason I had to since my mom made it and I wouldn’t want t 

When I was 16, the single hottest girl in the year invited me to her fancy dress party. I was under no illusions. I didn’t think this would mean she wanted to bang me on every piece of furniture in her house like I was her big toe. But still, a personalized invite from the school babe was something special. The problem was I just KNEW my Mum wouldn’t let me go. My Mum was a strict one, and there was study or chores to be done. Fun could wait. So I preempted her decision and accepted my fate. All week I reminded myself she’d say no, and got on with my life. I told myself that the party wasn’t really 

The most important event that changed my life was the event of my self-realization. On that day I realized that I, as a psychological entity, do not exist anywhere but in my own mind, and other people as psychological entities do not exist anywhere but in my mind either. And that all my emotions and the complex inner world I used to inhabit were of my own making. That I basically made it all up, that all of that was me, and only me. You can’t really enjoy people until it happens to you. Until that happens to you, you always see everyone through a psychological lens of your own. You evaluate, ju 

In 2017 — I drank more than 15 litres of alcohol in 5 days to land up in the hospital, hooked to an IV, for alcohol poisoning.  Back then, I had a hypo-manic episode. It's when you're pumped up with inescapable energy. You can't sleep, or eat, or stop moving because your mind won't stop working overtime. For years I'd shown signs of being bipolar, but, it was only a suspicion before this episode. Earlier, my first psychiatrist had told me I showed unnatural signs of extreme highs and lows. They were these moments of exceptional high when you're filled with manic bursts of energy. But, it was what came 

My father caught me… I was 18, and had secretly connected a wireless adapter up to our desktop so that it could catch the wireless signal from the router in the basement. Use of the internet, was forbidden by my father. His house, his rules. He had warned me about this before. Yet… I was a disobedient son. I wanted to check my emails, speak with my friends, browse the web, do what I thought that normal people my age did. He called me upstairs into the attic where the computer was, and asked me how I did it. I explained that I purchased a PCI adapter, and after installing it, unscrewed the antenna  

What was something small you went to the doctor for that turned out to be very significant?
I went to the doctor to talk about a burning sensation on certain patches of skin on my scalp and small of my back while showering(even slightly warm water felt like boiling water on these specific areas), he checked my back and scalp and said he couldn't find anything wrong. When I stood up from the examination the whole room started to spin and he saw me grab the bed, I felt like I was on a boat in the middle of a storm (so severely dizzy) within the space of 20 minutes, I went from complaining of burning sensation in my skin, to being unable to stand and double vision that left me unable to 

Two things, I suppose: (warning: 8am no sleep rambling- goes off topic a lot) Had been having heart palpitations for a few years- not often, maybe once or twice a year max but they were consistent and happened randomly- not during sports or anything. Once I was just sat on my bed reading when it happened. However, when I started having heart palpitations in the middle of a swimming lessons, more intense and faster than ever before, it triggered a panic attack, right there in the pool. I was in the worst spot, too- smack bang in the middle of the pool. No sides to hold on to, to floor to stand o 

So I have track record of being hospitalized for things like this. FIRST TIME: I was 5 or 6 (kindergarten) so I apologize that I don’t remember the details. Basically, I was a huge fan of playing on the monkey bars. Okay, normal, whatever. Well I started trying to learn a new trick. The girl who bullied me decided to put her hands on top of mine and hang over me until I dropped to the ground. This was normal for her. But this time I got a blister on my palm from it. I didn’t think much of it. I covered it with a bandaid, went to sleep, and the next morning it wasn’t hurting anymore. So at school 

Not me, but my dad. I've gone over it multiple times, so forgive me if I've missed anything - feel free to ask questions. In 2013, my dad got sick. He hated doctors so it took quite a bit of misery to convince him to go but, after having a long while of just feeling congested and headaches and overall unwell, he went to an ER and was diagnosed with a sinus infection. Fast forward two weeks, multiple ER visits and antibiotics and pain meds galore all doing nothing, and now the left half of my dad's face has slowly swollen until he couldn't see out of his left eye, and he now has a black spot form 

About 20 years ago I had a bicycle accident where I went over the handlebars and largely landed on my upper chest as a first contact point. I walked away from it without a major problem other than being pissed off at the car that had rapidly pulled up past me and turned into my “lane,” causing me to “emergency hit” the brakes, snap the rear brake cable, and thus stop with and fly over my nicely functioning front wheel and its efficient brake. A bit bruised and pissed off, but no biggie. Until a few weeks later when I was taking a relaxing hot shower and SUDDENLY feel an extremely sharp, very sma 

Not me, but my Mum. This all started in April this year. She worked full time as a personal carer in the high care section of a local old age home from 2pm to 10pm 5 days a week. Apart from occasional complaints of feeling tired, she was by all accounts and appearances heathly. Given she was a 67.5 yo woman working a physically active full time.job, this would be expected. In early April Mum was helping a resident into a chair and the resident dropped their weight into the chair pulling Mum with him. From then on Mum had some pain in her lower right abdomen. Given her age and what she did was sup 

Necrotizing Fasciitis. Monday morning i woke up to an itchy foot. Looked like a mosquito got me. Dang mosquitos!!! Like any other mosquitobite, you don’t care much. You know, scratch it a bit and that’s it. Monday evening, it was still itchy and even a bit painfull. Also, a red spot was developing on my leg. Hmmm, the mosquito bit me there too probably. No big deal…  Tuesday, i woke up to pain. There was no itching anymore. Just pain. A weird sensation. Slightly burning. It was also getting darker.  At this point, the pain was constantly there. Not even a couple 1g dafalgans or spidifens would help.  

I am 31 years old and suffer from colitis which I was diagnosed with back in 2016. I have regular appointments with a gastroenterologist but due to covid-19 and the additional pressure on the NHS these appointments kept getting pushed back. I started to suffer with what I thought was indigestion around 6 months ago but naively put it down to something to do with my colitis condition. After, my gastroenterologist appointment was moved back again I contacted my GP who agreed that it was probably something to do with my colitis, they agreed to write to my gastroenterologist to get an appointment  

My husband had a dark spot growing on his forehead. It looked like a birthmark. He'd had it for years, and for as long as we've been together (three years). He also has an autoimmune condition that causes his skin some difficulty when he's stressed. So I finally made him a dermatology appointment to see what could be done to manage this ongoing skin condition. While at the appointment, he got the usual full-body scan by the doctor. The doctor paused over the dark mark on my husband's head. He just casually mentioned that he would take a small sample of the tissue from that spot. The doc shrugge 

I was bored in English class one day and happened to notice a bump on one arm that wasn’t on the other arm. I mentioned that in passing to my stepmother who decided I should have it seen. Even though I was a high school senior, my medical records had go to the same pediatrician as my siblings when we moved several years before. Since I hadn’t had any reason to see a doctor in the intervening time, that’s where they were, so off to him I went. Besides, it was just a bump on the arm, so no big deal, right? The pediatrician looked it over, decided it was probably a hematoma, but that it should be  

What's a good example of "never mess with the quiet ones"?
I went to secondary school in a tough, all boys comprehensive in South London during the 70′s and 80′s. It was a dog eat dog kind of place with a definite hierarchy amongst the pupils depending on how tough people thought you were. I was quite low down on that ladder as I was always quiet and bookish, preferring to spend my time alone in a few spots only I knew about in the building or in the school library. I didn't have many friends at school because, frankly, I thought the vast majority of my fellow pupils were arseholes and I wanted nothing to do with them. This quietness and introversion d 

I have two that come to mind. In the year below me (year 9 Aus), there was a bloke who was a farm boy. He was the quiet type and a bit of a loner. Maybe a bit shy. He was picked on by the heroes of his class. There were 3 that hang out together and were the main culprits. Until one day he had enough. One punch took out the first idiot, “You can not do that to my mate.” The next punch the second was down. The 3rd shaped up and with one punch he was down. They left home alone after that. 3 punches 3 bullies down. My old man could tell a story but this one he told me fairly often and it was always  

As a kid I was a prime bullying target; I stammered, was (and still am) asthmatic, and wore glasses; all that made me fairly quiet and introverted, but I also loved to read and loved sports and outdoor pursuits, so looked and sounded like prime fodder for being bullied but could stand up for myself if I needed to. In junior school I was being bullied but just used to walk away; I couldn’t be bothered with the hassle and just wanted to be left alone to read a book. The bully for the first time managed to corner me when I was about 9 or 10. He started to badmouth me and push me. I couldn’t walk aw 

I was often faced with those who were quiet, who didn’t speak much and who never made a fuss over anything…no matter what was going on. But! That “but” came with a caveat and that caveat was that “quiet” meant “timid”. And this filled the meaning of slow waters always run deep and this is true for people who are quiet. At one time I worked as a letter carrier and the older men were men who had fought in the Second World War and other fronts and it was those men who had seen the worst of mankind who were the “quiet” ones. There was one man, always quiet and never made so much as a peep no matter w 

I was the quiet one. I tried to never speak out of turn, as I had learned at home that speaking out of turn could get you ridiculed incessantly, by almost every family member, and I had 10 siblings! That was the mildest thing that could happen, and worse, all the way up to beatings and whippings with the razor strop or the big paddle with holes drilled in it. So I was quiet and avoided being seen or heard. In the summer leading up to the 5th grade, I exploded into puberty. Went from a chubby little girl to 38 DD’s and slimmed out some. Of course, the immature little boys tried to tease me, snap 

David was the school bully, the class smart-mouth. He spent more time in the principal’s office, or at home suspended, than he did in class. He was always in a fist fight with the guys and forever making innuendos at all the girls. I was quiet, an introvert who always had my nose in a book. I dressed like a forty year old spinster, wearing skirts and cardigans. I didn’t have friends but I didn’t have enemies either. I was “goody two-shoes,” or “grandma” to those who didn’t like me. But I assumed I could’ve been called much worse. If I absolutely had to, I could usually use such abrasive sarcasm 

Often we pay the most attention to those with the loudest voices and the most to say. In doing this, we underestimate the power of the quiet ones. At any gathering of people, be it a party or a business meeting, there will be those who talk loudly and demand attention. These extroverts have lots of great ideas, are socially adept and draw others to them like moths to a flame. At that same party or business meeting, there will often be a quiet one. This person says little but listens a lot. If you watch carefully, you may see that he or she is taking everything in. When they finally speak, the re 

I was very shy as a kid. Maybe it was because our family moved around alot, so I was always the new kid trying to fit in. I was also the biggest kid in most of my classes. This was good and bad for me. Good in the way that I didn't get messed with as much a a small kid would have, but bad because I desperately wanted to not be noticed wherever I went. This particular day we were all on recess outside and I was just walking around keeping to myself. By the way, I was fourth grade at the time and the year was 1969. The class need was straight out of a Hollywood “revenge of the nerds" movie. Every 

you may be disgusted by the wording of this story so i advise you to leave if you’re uncomfortable. i was an early bloomer, still in elementary school when it started, so obviously i would get teased. in swimming class, there was this one girl whose name i forgot who would always look at my body and call me names. keep in mind, this was when all the girls in our class were present in the same room. i was embarrassed and never spoke up because literally everyone in the class was friends with her (besides me) so i thought they’d all gang up on me and bully me even more. she’d say very inappropriat 

When I was a kid in elementary and then middle school, I was a quiet loner. For some reason I was picked-on, mercilessly. The girls seemed to mostly like me, but the popular kids threw insults at me constantly, both up close and from afar. I just ignored it. I wasn't confrontational. Plus, I'd been told that fighting was bad. I was a mystery. Kids had somehow got the impression that I was a dork so I must be smart. I had a paper route and I carried around a huge wad of cash, which confused the heck out of them. Plus there was that girl thing, and I occasionally bought the cute girls stuff from  

What is the biggest lie you said but you will never regret?
it wasn't a lie. but I could consider it as one the way I answered my daughter back then. my bitter past was opened after years only here in Quora. it was about the father of my daughter, I am a single mom before I delivered her in this world. its my decision to raised her alone and I never regret about it. my daughter asked me about her father (i mean a heart to heart talk) when she's 14. I knew that day would really come and she will asked me things I am trying to bury in my past. my daughter asked me during her 14th birthday, i know she really planned it so I don't have anymore reason to get  

“Are you sure you are ready?” “Yes.” —Me, 4 1/2 years ago. I was getting married to my best friend. Was I ready? No. No, no, no. Not even a little bit. I was raised by a really abusive person who decided I wasn’t a person, but a fundament. So basically I was a husk of a person, constantly working when we re-connected. I look back on it now and realize that I hardly had a meal once every three days, and I have even bigger holes in my memory. I can’t even remember dating him, because I was falling asleep a lot of the time because he fed me full meals and my body just shut down to nab all the nourishmen 

What is the biggest lie you said but you will never regret? I told my friend they were trying to get him a liver transplant, but it was all a lie. I knew they had already decided that he was too ill to go on the list. For a couple of years his condition steadily worsened, and he faced it all with humour and grace. He was one of the funniest men I’ve ever met, and it was his gut-level honesty about his brand of the human condition that made him so funny. But there was a moment in that final week when he looked at me, his eyes widened, and he said, “I’m scared.” That was when I lied. When my time 

My first lie “ Don't worry ,the doctor said , your husband will be fine in some days.” I said that to a lady whose husband was injured in an accident. In fact the doctor had already told me and my colleagues that the man was not going to live more than a day or so. My second lie. “ Go on, enter the hall, no one will throw you out" I said to a mother and her daughter about 5 yrs old. In fact there was a show going on for children in a hall and the child was insisting with her mother to watch the show. People could watch the show after buying a ticket. I told the mother and her daughter, “ the show 

“I’m armed” I parked in the wrong place , I went out for a coffee with a friend, we chat for hours, when we realized the time it was almost 3 in the morning. At that time I realize that I parked in the opposite side of the mall, it wasn’t the mall parking lot. My girlfriend offered to drive me and I said no, after so many hours sitting down I can use the walk. I started walking, soon I realize that I was literally in a dessert ally . The gate of the parking lot was up, blasting music sounded were my car was parked. A group of men’s were drinking and dancing two cars over mine. It was to late f 

I cannot recall a lie as an adult. That sounds ridiculous to most. As a child, I told petty lies. The biggest that come to mind, ones about my grades. It was the teachers fault. Some that are just so silly to think about. It was usually when I was in trouble and so I blamed whoever else. My father loathed liars. When I was a teenager. Young. He punished me and my siblings often. Trying to teach us moral lessons. Not sure when it actually hit me the truth to what he was saying, but he scolded me a couple of times with his disgust for liars. “You are equal to cheaters and thieves. You cant expect 

I could use justifications to relieve myself of guilt but the very last thing I want is to make any lie ok. All lies lead to the worst possible results. Any lie told is a lie told to hide something and told with intent. The intent doesn't matter because deception robs the listener of choice. Here's my story. Please understand that I am not in need of anyone's opinion about it. I was driving in a little pickup truck loaded with tools and the rain was pouring down. I had covered the tools with a tarp but it had caught wind so I pulled over to the side of the highway to adjust it. My faithful Dober 

I know it is said that people lie sometimes, yet when I think about it their are times that I wished that I lied. Actually, several times I wish I had lied for some odd reason their isn’t a time that I can think of that I actually told a lie. Not everybody in this world is a liar. It is not in my nature to be like that. I may pick up on things and can’t forget that’s why I stop watching the News and that’s a reason I do not keep company. Most people just don’t care about another’s memories or what they pick up but that’s the News job is to tell. I guess how my mom raised me that you can die tell 

There usually is NO need to lie. Also, every instance is different:: For instance to eliminate lying(yuck):: Some one breaches my privacy; Instead of lying: i dont commit to any one idea or answer, and I confront them how I refuse or am unable to answer their query. The lies I will never “regret” are:: Anytime I am wrongfully being breached of privacy or violated in the extreme case of mere rudeness:: I lie, and do not “regret” it. (Every instance is different.) To each their own when it comes to their own ideas of what “privacy" etc. Is; therefore please do not judge me on my statement based on y 

All my biggest and mostly all my lies in their entirety have been to my mother. I can’t say I have a preference on a particular lie, maybe the time where she didn’t know where I was and I told her I was in the country but wasn’t. (boy that’s a random fact without the story but frankly that wasn’t the question! (:) most of those lies I don’t regret for the simple fact in the end it seems my instinct was right; with our relationship sometimes honesty is just hurting my mom. 433 views · View shares · Answer requested by Jessy Machado1Daniel Baisden, I worked toward a MFA in playwritingAnswered 1 year ago · Author has 2K answers and 152.9K answer views

What is the most horrific crime you've ever heard of someone doing?
WARNING: Disturbing content to follow. Goes without saying, really. The most gruesome crime I ever heard of was the Hi-Fi murders. APRIL 22, 1974 OGDEN, UTAH Three enlisted Air Force airmen, Dale Selby Pierre, William Andrews, Keith Roberts, and three other men who were never identified arrived at the Hi-Fi Shop (a home audio store) on Washington Boulevard just before closing time. They drove up in two white vans. Three of the men entered the store with drawn handguns. Roberts and at least one other man remained in the vehicles. There were two employees on duty at the shop that night: Stanley Walke 

WARNING! PLEASE READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! MIGHT BE SENSITIVE FOR PEOPLE WITH MINOR CHILDREN. I read a story in a history journal when I was a teen. It was in Mongolian and I cannot find the source online. But, it was something that shook me to the core and has nightmares about it all the time. During WWII, a lot of Mongolians were used under Russian rule to create a buffer zone between the Japanese occupied China and Russia. A lot of fathers were called into service to defend the southern border of Mongolia and mothers/elders were left home with kids to take care of business. It is my understanding t

IF YOU ARE CLAUSTROPHOBIC, THEN I ADVISE YOU STRICTLY NOT TO READ FURTHER. . . .. . . . . . Ok. To the daring Claustrophobic peeps and the Non- claustrophobic guys, this case is ppossibly the worst mental torture anyone could experience. Aight, lets speak on points.

Katherine Mary Knight was a strange pupil at Muswellbrook High School. She was an excellent student—humble, modest, and her efforts were, of course, rewarded. She was also an outsider. She bullied younger students, attacked a boy with a weapon, and physically assaulted a teacher. Knight had a scarring upbringing, having been born into a dysfunctional family, with a mother who was raped several times by her husband. Descriptions of these horrific events leaked into Knight’s personal life, intimate details that should never have reached her ears.  At age 15, Knight left school. She could neither read 

The most gruesome crime was of Grace Budd, this was read to me over and over again by my step father. I thought that was going to happen to me. This was a letter sent to Grace’s mother.  Grace Budd My dear Mrs Budd, In 1894 a friend of mine shipped as a deck hand on the steamer Tacoma, Capt John Davis. They sailed from San Francisco to Hong Kong China. On arriving there he and two others went ashore and got drunk. When they returned the boat was gone. At that time there was a famine in China. Meat of any kind was from $1 to 3 Dollars a pound. So great was the suffering among the very poor that all 

‼️TW TORTURE/RAPE/ASSUALT‼️  The pic is Junko Furuta. (The victim) She lived through 44 days of h*ll before dying. One of the most tortured people and gruesome crimes, is Junko Furuta. this story gives me chills because it is so disturbing. Junko lives in Misato, Japan. she is absolutely gorgeous which is why Hiroshi Miyano came up to her and told her this. Hiroshi Miyano was also a school student and thought Junko was gorgeous. He asked her out but junko declined. this made him so angry. Hiroshi was also a big gang member. One Day when Junko was riding on a bicycle home from her part time job, th 

There were three horrific stories that I read that will surprise anyone: Sylvia Likens, Junko Furuta, and Kelly Anne Bates. All three teenage girls were tortured to death. Sylvia Likens was an American girl who was brought to a woman, Gertrude Baniszewski, who her parents hired to watch her while they traveled with a carnival. Sylvia and her sister Jenny were abused by Gertrude but Sylvia had it the worse after many misfortunes, like being blamed for Gertrude’s older daughter’s problems and believing to be a prostitute. Out of all this, Sylvia became the target of immense torture passing up to  

The ‘Hello kitty’ murder. Warning: This is similar to the Junko Furuta case and is graphic.  In May, 1999, a 14-year-old girl made her way to a police station in Hong Kong - China. She told officers that for the past several weeks, she’d been constantly plagued by the ghost of a woman who had been bound by electrical wire and tortured to death. The police brushed her off, dismissing her claims as nothing but dreams or teenage nonsense. The girl, explained that the ghost, was of a woman she’d helped in murdering. The police followed the child back to a flat in the city’s rundown Kowloon district, wh

They were kidnapped on the evening of January 6, 2007, when Christian's vehicle was carjacked, and taken to a rental house, where both of them were raped, tortured, and murdered. Four black males, Eric D. Boyd, Letalvis D. Cobbins, Lemaricus Davidson, and George Thomas, and one black female, Eric D. Boyd, Letalvis D.

So read on at your own risk.  This was a young boy who become a victim of the notorious cannibalistic serial killer and rapist, Jeffery Dahmer. On the afternoon of May 26, 1991, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old named Konerak Sinthasomphone on Wisconsin Avenue. By coincidence, Sinthasomphone was the younger brother of the boy whom Dahmer had molested in 1988. He approached the youth with an offer of money to a 

What is the best advice that your hairdresser ever gave you?
Don’t shampoo every day—not even every other day. Twice a week is enough (wear a shower cap if you want to shower every day or oftener). In between, use a good dry shampoo. Use oil-based shine products (argan, coconut) rather than silicone. Less is more (couple of drops on your palm, rub hands together). If it looks too oily, follow up with a light spritz of dry shampoo—which will absorb the excess oil but still protect against frizz. Shampoo the roots, not the ends. Condition the ends, not the roots—just enough to detangle. Final rinse with cool water. If you must use hot tools, blow the roots d 

This is probably the most obvious advice ever, but at the time it was a life saver. When I was a child, my hair was really long. Before I had my first haircut at 7, it was down to my knees. I also loved swimming and was outdoorsy and active, so it got pretty tangled, even with the braids my mom normally kept it in. On top of that, I have a sensitive scalp, so it hurt to brush and comb my hair. I spent one of the worst evenings of my life with my mom on one couch, my dad on the other couch, and me in the chair in the middle while they both tried to get the tangles out of my wet hair after I had  

I’m 60 years old and a few years ago I was getting fed up with dyeing and highlighting (boxed) my own hair and wondered what it would be like to just let it come in naturally. I mean, I was 57 at the time so why am I trying to hide my gray. It’s the normal process with aging and frankly, I just didn’t care for this dark color on me anymore. I thought it washed out my complexion which is why I added highlights to break up the dark color. It would be such drastic change and no stylist ever suggested, recommended, or mentioned it so I was always reluctant to approach them with the idea. I schedule 

All my relatives used to say that I had really thick hair at some point in my life and I totally messed it up. Like every other girl I was confused how to look after the hair and come up with a proper hair care regime. I grew it out, cut it short and tried different hairstyles but my frequent travels and exposure to different kind of water never really helped. I used to hate going to hairdressers because normally they just lower your self esteem trying to market their products. I then moved to another town and I started growing out my hair since haircuts were a costly affair here. But after som 

I had been coloring my hair for years, as I couldnt imagine going grey. My sister always had negative comments, when it started growing out even a little bit. It got to the stage where I was having to color my hair every six weeks. I was in a shopping centre once, and there was a lady in front of me at the till. She was completely grey. I plucked up the courage and asked her how she felt being completely grey. I told her she was courages to have gone grey as I had difficulty even thinking about it. She looked much older than me. I asked her how old she was and I was shocked at her answer. She w 

Here’s a non-hair related piece of advice my hair dresser Anna gave me when I used to live in Maidenhead in UK. She was South African, used to do horse riding and grooming horses, dressage etc. That much I got from our conversations. Once, I walked in after having torn my cruciate ligament in my left knee playing Cricket. We talked a bit.. And a month later, when I returned to the game and promptly on the first ball, twisted my knee again and fell on my elbow, I fractured my arm. The next time I went to get a haircut, she laid this gem on me. “You just don’t bounce!”. Looking at my puzzled face, 

I was born with curly, wavy hair. For many years I worked against my natural hair pattern. I would have haircuts that were not appropriate for my hair texture and curl, I would spend an inordinate amount of time styling it to look straighter, I even slept with the largest rollers or beer cans I could fine. Of course with Philadelphia humidity my hair would curl and look “fuzzy” at the first sign of rain-or snow. Most hairstylists would accommodate my requests. Finally at the age of 28 my then hair stylist told me outright to SHUT THE F@&amp;$ UP, that he was tired of me fighting my hair, and he was 

I have been going to the same stylist for over 25 years now, and have gotten a lot of great hair advice from him. First, when coloring, stick to the two-shade rule….go two shades lighter or darker, and that’s it. Going from dark brown to blonde (which I did for a while, in my late teens) is highly damaging, due to the lightening process required, and maintenance needed thereafter. Second, don’t wash every day! It took me decades to follow this one, because I have rather oily hair that felt ‘dirty’ in-between, but the secret is brushing to distribute that oil to the parched ends. I now wash every 

When I was in high school many moons ago, as in 1995–1998 (freshman - senior years), I began this new obsessive love for bleaching my hair. This was a byproduct of having set my first appointment with a real, true hairstylist in the mall at Toni &amp; Guy, all at the urging of a good friend that I grew up with. I really needed to do that. I had really been kept pretty sheltered growing up, having not experienced the more material side of life. And, as an up &amp; coming gay man for my time, this was just what I needed. I settled on what we called then “the Clooney” which was a far cry from my then par 

Thanks for A2A Anita Durairaj The best advice my haridresser gave me is, Cut your hair atleast once in 6months, so that to avoid split ends.Dont apply hair serum over scalp, use it in tips of hairs to maintain good texture.Add some water with shampoo and apply it in scalp so that the effect of chemical isn’t going to affect more.Use egg+olive oil mixture as a hair mask which improves the strength of hair. Make sure to wash the mask in luke water. Provided if you are applying both yellow and white mixture with olive oil, wash it properly as it may provide you bad odour. Note: I’m applying egg whi

Who has lived a life worth following?
I would say Ibn Battuta. The reason I choose him is because this man did more is one life than we would do in a hundred. He lived the life of a scholar, an explorer, a judge and much more. To top it all off, he noted the events of his life in an autobiography so that we can all experience his life.  Ibn Battuta Origin We know very little about the origins of this man. Ibn Battuta was born in 1304. He was a man of Berber origin from what is now Morocco. His full name was Shams al-Din Abu Abd al-Lah Muhammad ibn Abd al-Lah l-Lawati Tangi Ibn Battuta. He set out on his first journey at the age of 21.   

Meet Nicholas Winton.  He found himself in Prague in December of 1938. It was supposed to be a 3-week vacation. Instead of going skiing in Switzerland, he chose to assist a friend in helping Jewish children escape the fate the Nazis had in store for them. From his room in the Europa Hotel in Wenceslas Square, he organised. He did nothing heroic. His life was never in danger. Nicholas just did paperwork. He recorded the names of children and took their photos. He applied to the British Home Office to get them entry permits. This was only possible because the British House of Commons had passed legisl 

Someone asked: “Who has lived a life worth following?” Wow! I can smell the bait on this one! The Christian answer would be Jesus; the Jewish answer would be Moses, and the Islamic answer would be Muhammad. Technically, Moses led the Hebrews OUT of Egypt and bondage (slavery to false gods and slavery in general.) Modern Judaism is starting to trend towards acceptance of Jesus as the actual Messiah (the Old Testament Scriptures actually prove this to be the case.) Jesus leads His followers even today into Eternal Life, the understanding that Life is eternal. Mohammad’s teaching only leads to jiha 

"Follow me." Two straightforward words that took on endless noteworthiness when articulated by the best chief ever: Jesus Christ. Today, that expression is as drawing in, engaging, and life changing as ever previously. As the Kingdom keeps on stretching out over the earth, the encouragement to live genuinely as a spiritual good example is one that all adherents have the benefit of seeking after, not for a title or due to a stage, yet for the commission to make devotees everything being equal, work well for individuals, and really re-present Jesus to a world so urgently needing expectation that 

Question: Who has lived a life worth following? God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God has enabled people to choose their own destinations. God does not predetermine plans for us. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: ‘Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience’ All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. “In obedience and repentance is your salvation” Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be bles 

We have had so many great people on this planet. They have done great things and worth to be remembered, through their generosity many lives have been inspired and impacted. But there is only one man through out the entire history who is worth to be followed. This man humbled himself yet had what no man will ever have, he was very rich yet he lived like &amp; with the poor, raised the dead who never visited his grave when he was buried, never attended any college yet he was the source of wisdom. This man loved everyone to the point of giving his life as a ransom for many. He is the only one who has a

 Many know this smiling, gap-toothed face from anywhere, but few know his story. As a 9 year old, he was named “Bob”. Immediately, a lot of antennas raise…”I thought his name was Michael?!” His name is Michael; Michael Strahan, if you didn’t know. Actually, Michael Anthony Strahan, if you want his full government name. No Bob, no Robert is in his name…his father’s name was Gene, and no one else in his family or recent ancestry was named Bob. So where was this nickname inspired from? Turns out this was not truly a name, but an acronym..Bob was B.o.b, which stood for “Booty on back”. He was chubby  

I happen to be 81 this year and I've read a lot about world history and feel that I'm pretty knowledgeable about it certainly not like the great professors all of the universities across the world but for a private individual who was a woodworker by trade I used to teach shop years ago I would say in my lifetime no more than four or five people and I think most of those people were assassinated so in the last 15 years I've been doing a lot of reading about the famous philosophers of the world who are the tempted to figure out what life is all about at a stream level and I've picked up a lot of 

A few people have lived such exceptional lives that they are worth emulating: BuddhaAristotleBenjamin FranklinMarcus AureliusPericlesThey all had a dedication to learning and good works. They made every minute of their lives count. They lived in service of others. I could have listed others. This is a sample of some of the most accomplished people in the history of the world. They were, in order, a spiritual leader, the most talented intellectual of perhaps all time, an American statesmen and writer and diplomat, the wisest emperor of Rome, and the leader of Athens at its cultural peak. They al

One of my exes has a brother . we’ll call him Ike . Ike is the charming , fun , funny , chill type of man many dudes hope to be . Charismatic and always able to attract people to him . He’s just a hard guy to hate. Unfortunately in our black community there are a lot of broken homes but my ex and Ike came from one of the most beautiful and tightknit families I’d ever seen . church-going , grand parents live in the house , he was the only boy and both of his parents were together . We live in nice suburbs and both of his parents had great jobs . Ike had every reason to be successful . great upbr 

I’ve seen many, but one stands out in particular. About 7-years ago, one of my friends ended up having an affair, and was caught by her husband outside the restaurant where the lover worked. She called me on the phone and was more angry about being caught than realizing the ramifications of what was coming. She then called me and said that her husband had texted her that “it is all gone. enjoy your life now.” She was on her way home and asked if I would come with her. I agreed and when we arrived it was about an hour before her 3 kids were scheduled to arrive on their school bus. While standing  

Thanks for the A2A. It hurts my heart to write this because I still cannot believe this happened to a person who I love very, very much. It completely changed his life, his personality, and it feels like his soul was stripped from his body. Never in my life would I expect this to happen to one of the smartest people I know. At 23 years of age, he was on top of the world. He had recently graduated college, had his career and life ahead of him. At this young age he had saved up more than the average person saves in a lifetime, all on his own. Smart, warm, loved by many. Has the courage of a lion.  

Bubba had been married to a gal for almost 30 years. They used to say “together we can accomplish anything”, and we all believed it was true. She gave up job after job to follow him around when he was in the Navy. When he got out she again moved twice so he could further his career and put everything she had built aside: her career, schooling, friends. It was for the “good of the family”. As years went by he started to treat her as a lesser person. HE worked and had a title, she was nothing. She was curvy but not fat, a little on the short side. He was tall over 6′3″ but started piling on the we 

Settling! Without a doubt, settling! I made the same mistake too, at the same time, but luckily, I got out. I was/am part of all kinds of groups, but at the time I am thinking about, I had two close friends. At the time, I had the thinnest fingers, so I am also the only one to have tried on all three of our engagement rings! Those rings cost us a lot more than money and none of us should ever have worn them. Having been alone for a long time, I took harsh advice, dieted away about 40kg and lowered my standards. But because my ex-partner was also unattractive, she had to lower her standards to be 

My aunt. Growing up, I had two aunts I was close to, both my fathers sisters. His parents both died within months of each other when me and my siblings were young, so my aunts were essentially a second set of parents to me and my siblings. They were always the ones who provided the extra love, support and encouragement that my parents weren’t able to (I come from a family of four kids and a really hardworking dad who wasn’t able to be around [and seldom ‘present’] for most of my childhood, so my aunts presence in my life is something I always appreciated.) Both of my aunts have always enjoyed ga 

A friend of mine kept talking about getting an online bride, we all tried to talk him out of it and instead set him up with nice girls we knew, but he never followed through. There was always something wrong with the girl, and he started to tell us that he was going to go get a Ukrainian bride from some website. We tried to discourage him, but nope, he would not listen. He went on this tour and came back engaged, pictures showed she was a really pretty young blond girl, about half his age. Well we wished him well but doubted it would be successful. He got her to USA and had this big wedding. Ri 

I knew a lonely 12-year-old child who had just finished a major exam. Bored with no hobbies or goals to pursue, the child resorted to daydreaming the days away so as to occupy herself. How could the child know it was one of the biggest mistakes he or she ever committed. Eventually, she realized that she had been daydreaming over one-third of her life away. She developed a relatively unknown mental disorder, maladaptive daydreaming. Maladaptive daydreaming is the imagining and indulging of vivid, intensive fantasies to the point where one neglects the happenings of their life. Her grades deterio 

I know one. True story few years ago in a west coast city from Canada. I was a newcomer back then. New to the city and was making friends. I met Dar at a beach through a guy I met from a dating site. Long story. We became friends and we both like to to things together in the city. We started hanging out more and more and she boyfriend Chr came into the picture. Dar was originally from a small town on the East Coast. She was doing quite ok. 29, doing her social science degree from UBC (the best in the province and one of the top in Canada), got a part time job as a waitress, made enough money to 

My friend has terrible luck with boys. She ‘dates’ them (which in our conservative desi culture means texting, smiling at them from a distance, telling each other you love them even though you don’t know shit about them, never actually meeting them) and they proceed to chat her up and leave her when they get bored. It’s all a way to pass time with the guys she connects to, despite how serious she says the guy is. One particular guy asked her to marry him. The guy was around 24, she was 20. Everyone in her extended family knew about them. All her friends knew about them. No one had even met the 

Has a young child ever come up to you alone and asked for help? How did you react, and what did you do?
I kept digging through the rubble afraid of what I would find under the remains of, what used to be this familie's makeshift home, made from garbage. Homes like these, not up to codes, because codes don't exist in the town of Waiaula, a slum town, that used to be one, of six districts populated by the descendents of ancient Hawaiians within the Waiaula district in the City and County of Honolulu, Oahu Hawaii. The little girl who led me into this half demolished “do it yourself with whatever treasure you find at the dump” was actually in somewhat better shape than most of the properties in this 

Oh god. I am a kind person. I’m obsessed with helping children. I’m especially obsessed with ending child sexual abuse. The U.S. is one of the leading producers of child “porn” in the world. I’m vexed by the unheard cries of those children. I have taken needy people into my home before and I’ll do it again. But yes. There was a time when a kid asked me for help. I wish I’d understood. I had just gotten divorced. My first husband was a nice, troubled man. In general, he was sweet. But sometimes, when he was emotionally overwrought, he slapped me. Simple as that. When I left the ex, I went to Holl 

Donavin, carlitos and the little chinese girl. She was five years old and in daycare. I first saw her outside the day care building on 26 and 9th ave in Manhattan. She was alone and crying and I asked her what was wrong. She did not answer so I looked around and heard noises from inside a building with an open door. I walked in here with the girl in tow and asked if they knew her. A lady came up looked at her and said : yes... but she can not stay here any longer because her mother has not shown up to pick her up on time twice in a row so she has to go... we are not responsible for her.!

This occurred several years ago, before mobile phones were as commonplace as they are today. I would have done things differently today. I was walking in my residential neighborhood on Easter, if I remember correctly. I was just heading home when this tot between 2–3 years old just seemed to appear from nowhere in the grass verge between the pavement and the street. I rushed towards him and managed to turn him away from the road. I asked him where home was, where Mummy was, and didn't get answers, but he did turn around and start walking back towards where I'd first seen him. I was terrified to 

Two occasions although the children didn't specifically ask for help. The first time was about 25 years ago, not long after Jamie Bulger was kidnapped and killed. I was shopping in a busy mall and this little boy, aged about 7 or 8, was practically hugging the wall and sobbing. All the other adults just walked past him, either not seeing him or ignoring him. Well, I can't leave a clearly distressed child to sob on his own, so I went up to him to see if he was ok. He told me he'd gotten lost from his dad. I told him it would all be fine and took him into the nearest shop. I was a regular in this 

Funny I should see this question tonight because it just happened to me today. My two daughters had just finished their ski lessons and I was nearing the door to one of the change rooms to bring them in. Standing near my daughters outside the door was a boy a little younger than my oldest daughter, perhaps 8 years old, East Asian, like me, which is probably why he spoke to me. He told me that he couldn't find his dad and was going outside to find him. Now, this is the time when we are all finishing up and changing our kids out of their rental equipment, so things are a little chaotic. He wasn't  

Yes, and it was a frightening experience! My daughter and I were shopping for school clothes, as were thousands of other parents and their kids. He was about 5 or 6 years old; I could see that he'd been crying, but was trying to get himself under control. He said he couldn't find his Mommy, and would I help. My first thought was to put my arms around him, but I forced myself not to. I smiled, put out my hand, told him my name and asked his. He told me his name was Little Guy. I asked where he lost his Mommy; he pointed toward a large chain store and said he thought it was there. Knowing there was 

About 5 years ago, I went home for the weekend to visit my mother. She lives in a 9th floor apartment in Toronto. She was away for a couple of hours and I was prepping for my classes for the upcoming week. In the middle of an assignment, I was distracted by the sound of a crying child. At first I thought it was coming from one of my mom’s neighbours. Out of curiosity, I opened the front door and stepped into the hallway. A few meters away from our door, a little boy was crying and looking around. He was about 3–4 years old and seemed quite disoriented, not to mention scared. He tried to open the 

Brea was a 5 year old neighborhood girl that would come to our house early in the morning. Like early. Like knocking on the door at 7am. Her words, “My mom wanted to know if I could come play at your house.” Brea lived around the block from us with her part-time mom in an upstairs apartment. Her mom had five other children that had already been “unfairly taken away” from her because her ex-husband was “remarried to a lawyer”. Sometimes mom would walk to our house in the evenings with shaking hands and a coffee mug in her hand. Sometimes the mug smelled of alcohol. On occasion we would sit on t 

I’ve had a few. The most recent one was too young to ask for help. It was about 2:30am and I was at a service station on a motorway, miles from anywhere. I had stopped for fuel and whilst filling up another car that was on the forecourt pulled off. As they did so I nonchalantly glanced up, in a world of my own whilst pumping fuel and noticed a small child, naked and covered in faeces standing in the dark on the edge of the forecourt over beyond where the car had been. He didn’t seem at all bothered or distressed and was quite happily just wandering about picking at the grass and stuff. I looked

Feminists calling every person who supports men’s rights a misogynist. “You misogynist, chauvinistic pig!” How many men must have heard this? It is a common sentence that gets thrown at men a lot of times whenever they try to discuss the issues they face. Apparently, the term isn’t just reserved for men. There is a rising trend on Quora where ANY person who speaks up in support of men’s rights or decides to disagree with feminism is called a misogynist. I only realized this trend when I voiced my support towards men’s issues. For all the butthurt feminists of Quora, here is the definition of misog 

The mindset of men towards women in the Islamic Arab countries. I am not to write anonymously about this. And although I am completely aware that this answer may result in many troubles for me, but here I am, an example of an Arab ex-Muslim twenty-year-old girl whose trying to clarify, to some extent, what is happening to women in this part of the world. To be fair, I must note that, of course, every rule has its own exceptions, but I am going to point out to what's common in where I live through what I've seen and heard from incidents and struggles of many Arab women.

A week ago, I went to a photo studio to have a headshot taken. It was a little crowded so I had to sit and wait for my turn. A teenage girl came in wearing the traditional shalvar kameez along with a hijab. She looked like she was around 14 and she came with her father who was wearing the traditional dress as well. I suppose they had a reservation because their turn came first. The photographer told the girl to settle down while he set his camera. The girl took off her hijab and let down her hair. She was combing her hair when her father came storming in and told her to cover her head. The girl 

The fact people are willing to become ignorant and cruel just to defend an ideology. I think, contrary to many opinions, most people are actually good. At least, they stick to their morals. I saw this story about a girl getting raped in Pakistan as a pre-accorded revenge, in which her own family agreed. The girl could have ran away, yet she stayed. Her family could have said no, but for some reason, they didn't. Most of the individuals involved probably share a mindset, a sick mindset, but that doesn't mean they don't have the capacity to love or to feel. Still, what they did was horrible and d 

I get annoyed over little things although I hide my emotions well… When I greet someone with 'salaam alikum' and they don't reply back the proper way. Yes it happens. I meet some Muslims here in the UK and they don't even reply back the right way (wa alaykum salaam) and even if they do they usually think it is funny. I get so frustrated and angry about this but I keep quiet. Stop being embarrassed. I say it because usually I feel down and saying it and hearing a reply makes me feel better.Fake friendliness. One of the things I hate the most. I'd rather be mistreated than have people pretending 

Women claiming they want equality. It frustrates me to no end.  Instead of going on yet another diatribe, I’ll give a short explanation as to why this is definitely not what women should be asking for: Women can get pregnant, and when they do, they need time off to focus on their labour, and also time to recover from the pregnancy. They (and the child) also need the support of a man at that time. In most countries, men are not recognized for that role and don’t get time off, or at max about 2 weeks off. You really want us to start treating women the way we treat men?Although possible, due to phys

I'm writing anonymous due to the fact my mother is a frequent reader of quora. Colorful language ahead. I am currently 17 years old and living one of the dullest lives possible of an average teenager my age. I'm by no means a trouble maker at home nor am I at school. I'm a junior in highschool and my grades are pretty average aside from algebra because… its math. You may be wondering well what frustrates you? Its the fact that I can't enjoy the teenage life. You know this consist of the small things like going to the movies or maybe going to the mall with your friends. Or maybe even walking to t 

One of the things that frustrates me is the constant assertion that children who aren't smacked are not disciplined. Proponents of corporal punishment are under the illusion that all those of us who choose not to hit our children instead let them run wild, unchecked. They couldn't be more wrong. Yes there are some parents who either through laziness or ignorance don't discipline their offspring. Some even make a conscious decision to not instill any discipline at all. Ever. The “n” word (no) is a no-no. They think the child must learn to negotiate life through their own trials and errors. No rul

“Not all men.”  Sarah Everard, a 33 year-old woman went missing while walking home in South London. She was found dead on March 12, just a few days later. A police officer has been charged with her murder. Sarah wore bright clothing. She called her boyfriend. She wore sensible shoes. She walked under well-lit streets. Covered every inch of skin. She did everything right.  And it still didn’t save her. The level of victim blaming around Sarah Everard is disgusting. People don’t get attacked because of what they wore, what they did, who they talked to or if they walked home alone. People get attacked be

What is the stingiest thing that you have seen a family member do?
I have a few here: My late ex in-laws had always struggled with money, although they both worked unbelievably hard. My father in law had suffered with polio as a young man and lived with terrible pain all of his life. He always worked through it all until they retired. Just being left with the UK state pension, life got even harder for them. My ex husband bought them an old caravan, which they lovingly did up and it became their pride and joy. Their first holiday with it was only about 20 miles away from their home, but they were really excited to be getting away even though they had no spendin 

My father lived with me for 5 years rent free. Never even mentioned money after his then wife turned 62 cashed in on his social security, and left his ass. She won’t divorce him. Anyways we had a small liquor store. The liquor store was doing ok but not great, Obama took office, my construction career tanked and the liquor store kept us going till it didn’t in 2011. We had a baby in 2011 and we sold the store, we didn’t lose any money but we didn’t have a way to turn that money over, anyhow I started selling the pills I received from my doctor to help with the bills. Eventually that was a bust 

I have a cousin that is notoriously cheap that it has become a running joke in our family. Once she came to to stay with my family for two weeks where we cooked, took her out for meals, drove her to locations she wanted to see and catered to her. She knew I wanted a wine rack as I had been shopping for one with her a few days prior. I worked this day and came home and she had bought me one. How thoughtful! I was unsure though if it was a gift or not so I asked her what I owed her. She told me $80!! Okay, more than I wanted to spend for something I didn’t pick out but I paid her because luckily  

My husband’s aunt not telling the rest of my husband’s family that my husband’s father’s parents (my husbands grandparents) had passed away, so she could gather all of the money before anyone else knew they had passed and started the legal processes.EDIT: I wanted to add another that I think is just as bad since I’m not sure how to make a 2nd separate comment on a post yet (if that’s possible at all lol) So here’s the 2nd stingiest thing I’ve seen someone do: 2.

Early in my marriage, my husband told me that he’d be set for life because his parents were very well off (when his father dies, he’ll inherit close to a million dollars, as will his brother and sister). He’s a CPA who does his dad’s taxes and handles financial matters for him, and I’ve seen some of the paperwork, so I know that this is true. Both of his parents were Depression-era babies, as were mine. The big difference between the two sets of parents is that my parents decided early on that they would rather help out my brother and me while they were still alive so that they could see the di 

My mother always behaved like she was entitled to the best of everything, and thought the bare minimum was good enough as far as other people. She insisted on holding her husband’s paycheck as well as her own, deciding how the money would be used before he even had access to it. She’d say she was depositing both paychecks into the bank account, but actually she cashed them and spent the money as she pleased, then hid some in her purse for later, depositing whatever was left (if anything) when she was finished. I know that because she often took me with her. Bills often didn’t get paid, and when  

My ex-husband’s grandmother was a millionaire but she was the cheapest person I’ve ever met. As an example, one year, we went to her house for Christmas and were exchanging gifts. At the time, I was supporting my whole family because my ex was a deadbeat and we were just making ends meet. Despite this, I bought grandma nice gifts (around $100 for them), mainly because she was getting up there in age and I wanted to make sure she had a nice holiday. When it came time to give me a gift, she went into a back room and emerged with an unwrapped shoebox. When I opened it, there was a used extension

I’m from a family with 8 children with a tradition of getting together monthly at each other’s homes to share a meal and socialize. Once we all had significant others it was normal to have about 16 adults plus children attending. The person hosting would provide the place, the dinnerware and beverages and everyone would bring a dish to share. It was always a feast with most of us bringing at least one if not more items. My oldest sister, although she was always one to parade her success making sure we knew she was well traveled, had important friends and luxury items, was always the cheapest. H 

After my mother had back surgery, she had to walk 2 miles a day. Of course, she lives in the country and the weather doesn't always behave in Oklahoma. My aunt Kathy, her sister in law, had a treadmill that she hadn't used, but for a catch all, in so long, the dust was thick, and there were cobwebs. My uncle Jimmy, mother's little brother, knew she needed a treadmill and was going to sell it to mother, at a MUCH discounted price than if mother had to get a new one. Uncle Jimmy knew aunt Kathy hadn't used it in years, and thought she would be glad to be rid of it, get it out of the way. Oh no,

Yes I have a major crush on a Quoran, though he is not much popular here. I would have written this answer without being anonymous, but uff he hates these type of answers and he would have reported it instead of replying. Okay so lets see who he is: He is 17 years old and he also has a blog.He lives in a stubborn illusion.He has such an unique name, so much so that many people report his account for fake name, ugh.His name means ‘Curious’.I don’t know why actually does he mentions himself as lunatic, I don’t think he is.He doesn’t follow back or reply to messages generally.

I have a few stories that developed in the mind share about one of them. I won't point at it specifically. I also use "she" and "he" to make this a little easier on the eyes but at least one, maybe more, of the stories below are same-sex stories. Case #1: She reads his answers and she is blown away. He is funny, outgoing, and he has something to say about most anything. When she clicks on his profile she discovers he's in the same state as her, only a 45 minute drive away. She messages him for coffee and coffee happens. Smart guy, smart gal. More driving, more meeting, then a weekend at his pla 

Of course I have. I've had several. Some were age appropriate. Some were not. Some I've actively pursued. Some I haven't. My most recent Quora crush who I decided to pursue turned out to be a bust. She and I are not compatible… leastwise she's not willing to change for the likes of me so. But that's fairly typical of teenage girls now isn't it? This one woman on here who sort of found me to be attractive has stopped speaking to me even though I think she and I would have gotten along excellently. However she got drunk one night and a tad bitchy as most drunk people tend to get and she said I only wa 

Oh yes. The first time I came across her answer, I remember scrolling past it because I assumed her to be one of the models from those stock photos. And then I saw her again, and again, and again. Soon, I found myself binge reading her answers; and I don’t throw this word around easily, but I was floored. There was this clarity in the stuff she wrote. Stalked her Insta once, and then got busy with my life. But couple of days later, out of the blue, she liked a picture of mine on Insta. I sent her a text and we started talking. There are some people you could easily connect with, right? Well… she wa

Currently and forever… I just met him a two weeks ago and he’s really nice and fun. I love his personality and I especially love how he listens and cares for everyone he knows. When I first met him, I was so scared of what he was going to say because the first thing he texted me was, “is that BTS on your profile?”. I got so scared because I thought he was going to say that he didn’t like them and I would’ve gotten offended but luckily he said he liked them and he was new to them so I was like, “Ok great.” He became a family member to me like a few of my old friends and not a lot of my friends be

Major crush! I would, in all probability, blush and close my eyes if I saw him ever! I wouldn’t be surprised if I swoon at first sight. Picture Ginny Weasley meets Harry Potter in her awkward phase. This man has everything crush-worthy. He’s got class, he’s super fit, he is old world charm in his formal suit and did I mention he’s super powerful? He is without doubt, the most handsome man on Quora. Forget Quora, he’s one of the most desirable man to walk on this planet. Most importantly, he has a great sense of humour. He’s liberal minded and is in a great leadership position. In fact, he might b 

Yes, I have had a HUGE HUGE crush on a Quoran like never had before in my 27 years but can't express this to her. Although she does not have many followers and also not a frequent writer here still, I can't restrict myself falling on her. It's not only her philosophical write-ups on quora and prettiness that catch my attention. She writes fantastic poems and articles on her blog.

Yes I had a Quora crush. One is male and other is female ! A small background about myself: I am 20 year old girl who is very very shy to talk to boys and when I saw this person I immediately fell for him,I was an avid reader of all of his writings and I am a huge fan for him. Actually I thought of not to be an anonymous but due to the reason how he would react I am writing this way. Coming to him ! He is an NITian.He is 21.He loves his Father a lot.He started his own business at 19.And his quora bio is damn impressive. One more thing is he is a perfect extrovert with entrepreneur mindset and love s

What's the saddest celebrity moment ever caught on camera?
Princess Diana: Alienated from the royal family and estranged from her husband, the picture below was captured in 1992 when she was seen leaving for Egypt, a year described by the Queen as the most horrible.  In 1996, the couple agreed to divorce but she was killed in a car crash a year later, together with her Egyptian partner Dodi Al Fayed. The few seconds before the crash were captured on camera. On the left is her bodyguard who looks panicked:  Trapped in the wreck of the backseat, she was still breathing as the paparazzi gathered around snapping pictures instead of calling the ambulance.

Here are some examples Jenny Slate And Chris Evans Break Up : Jenny Slate and Chris Evans won our hearts when the two announced that they were -dating in 2016 after starring in the film Gifted together. The relationship charmed everyone because Slate is an unassuming and charming comedian who we all aspire to be and Evans is the handsome hunk we all aspire to be with. Enough with those Hollywood heartthrobs dating super models! However, the relationship was not meant to be and the two called it off in early 2017. But the two reunited at the premiere of their movie in April and there seemed to b 

Hello, thank you for the request question, I will trying to answer it. I see nobody answer this actor, so let me show you all. See this picture?   Look how beautiful that smile is and how handsome he is. He is smiling in the passenger seat of his friend's Porsche.  See that picture above? He looking so happy because he enjoys talking to his friends. But less than a few moments later this is what happened to him.     I think all of you already know who's this actor that I want to share.   He is PAUL WALKER, the American sweetheart man. Ahead of the crash, Walker was in Santa Clarita for a fundraiser his charity 

Thanks for A2A Vitmor Gomes I don't know if it counts as the saddest moment but I will include it anyway. CLOUT CHASING BY THE GRAMMY IN 2021. I think you get the idea here.  “ I TOLD YOU.” Says RM as he disappointedly looks at the Grammy results for the category of “best pop duo/group". BTS were the first K-Pop group in the entire history of music awards to be nominated for the Grammy, doesn't sound as bad but ‘Rain on me' by Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande over ‘Dynamite'? I accept that Dynamite is not BTS' best work but still Rain on me? I'm a Gaga fan but the question remains, Rain on me? I didn't 

 Simply known as “The Greatest”, Muhammad Ali had it all - enormous wealth, exceptional good looks, freakish athleticism, and hundreds of millions of adoring fans. According to international polls, it was Ali who finally toppled Elvis as the “The Most Famous Person in the World”. This is his final picture before taking exit from his frail, withered body. After someone stole his bicycle, a young Cassius Clay decided to “whup the thief”. He never got the chance, but, hoping for the opportunity, took some boxing lessons at a local gym. Six years later, while still in his teens, he would win an Olym 

Question: What's the saddest celebrity moment ever caught on camera? Answer: Stephen Robert Irwin (22 February 1962 – 4 September 2006), nicknamed "The Crocodile Hunter", was an Australian zookeeper, television personality, wildlife expert, environmentalist, and conservationist. Irwin achieved worldwide fame from the television series The Crocodile Hunter (1996–2007), an internationally broadcast wildlife documentary series that he co-hosted with his wife Terri. The couple also hosted the series Croc Files (1999–2001), The Crocodile Hunter Diaries (2002–2006), and New Breed Vets (2005). They also 

Selena Gomez Gets Punched In The Face  via Toronto Sun Selena Gomez seems to be in a great relationship right now with The Weeknd but her former relationship with Justin Bieber was not so ideal. Back before Bieber got all the tattoos and grew out his bangs, he and Gomez were the ultimate young power couple. However, there was definitely trouble in paradise. Gomez has since said that her relationship with Bieber was not a great experience and this particular situation that transpired on his 17th birthday was proof. The story goes that the two were running from the paparazzi when Gomez was punched  

On Tuesday August 16, 1977 a 42-year-old morbidly obese man was found on the bathroom floor of his house, totally unresponsive and in a strange frozen “seated position.” Some time later he was pronounced dead, at the Baptist memorial hospital. That man was Elvis Presley.  For most of his career, he had been the most famous person in the world. His fame was only paralleled by one — and only one — music band in the world (4 young boys from Liverpool called “The Beatles”). Once a very beautiful man, in the last years the trainwreck his life had become had treated him badly, and he did just about the sa 

I’ve always thought the last image taken of actor Marlon Brando leaving a car going to the hospital was sad. Brando had grown morbidly obese over the years and was, in his final moments, barely able to walk — he was pushed around in a wheelchair most of the time…  Now Brando had been, in his younger years, one of the most devastatingly handsome men ever to grace the silver screen. He had been all muscle and marvelously sculpted perfection, a Greek God come to life… but he was a man who suffered extreme moodswings and, at times, great depressive episodes. His greatest comfort by far was food. Eve 

When I was 18, I worked as a summer camp counselor in a very wealthy gated community where a lot of celebrities lived. I grew up in LA and definitely have had my fair share of celebrity run ins, but when I worked at this summer camp, I met more celebrities than I ever had in my life. Eddy Murphy, Kelsey Grammar, Derek Fisher, Will Smith, Jessica Alba, and many more. And, of course, Britney Spears. Britney Spears would occasionally come to the club house (where we usually spent most of the time at for the summer camp) to go swimming. I’m not quite sure why, I’m sure she could have had her own pr

What was the most disrespectful thing a guest in your home ever said to one of your family members, yourself, or another guest?
This happened to me several years ago, in 2012 to be exact. What was said was not only disrespectful, but flat out cruel and inappropriate. I’ll give a little back story, so that you can have a better understanding of the whole picture, as to why what’s been said and when it’s been said, was so much more painful and cruel. I am originally from Eastern Europe, been living in the States for over 20 years now. I left home when I was 24 years old (I was a journalist, covering stories about war, political corruption, police brutality etc., resulting in harassment and threats towards me and my family 

I have to warn you. This answer contains a swear word. I refuse to use an asterisk because you need to hear the word exactly how I heard it. And anyway, they didn't have asterisks back ib the '90s.  I’m going to go back a long, long time. Like a really long time. To when I was in my early twenties. I had recently moved in with my boyfriend of the time, Brain, who is now my husband. We were renting a small bungalow on a modern estate in a town called Newquay in Cornwall. For those of you who aren't familiar with the term bungalow, it's what the British call a one-story house with paving slabs outside 

I would say disrespectful to my wife mainly. We invited a female friend of mine I had known from work several years ago, to dinner at our home. This girl is middle aged, not at all pretty but a Smokin8s body DD breasts, she is a single wild girl loves to party. My wife and I cannot believe she can socialize, go to clubs and drink as much and as often as she does at her age, but she does. She is a flirt and according to her is constantly having sex with young guys. Never been married, no children. She is surely the life of a party and on top of all this a genuinely nice person. My wife likes n  

When my husband and I were in the first year of our marriage we purchased a home his mother wanted to fly out to see us and our new home and we agreed. In the house, I normally walk around in some booty shorts and t-shirts and I very rarely wear a bra. I discussed this with my husband and he assured me that his mother didn’t care what I wore and that I should wear what I wanted in my house. His mother arrived and she was happy to see us and thought we made an excellent purchase. Like normal, I wore my booty shorts around the house and the first few days my MIL didn’t say anything. On the third d 

It was a couple of months ago I had a house warming party for my new house. My wife's step father was there amongst the guests and he is a pathological liar. Some of the bullshit that he has came out with is he's owns a motorcycle worth 5.2 million dollars, he has 5 PHDs, he has an IQ of 130, he has lots of property in America, he owns a house here in Australia, he had LP records worth $180,000 each, but the one that makes me so angry is when he starts talking about serving in the super special forces in the army. This is an insult to me who has served in the army and also every single person  

Howdy! This aint my home but someone elses home! A long, long time ago, when I was really young, maybe 9 or 10, I would go out with my great-grandma, my grandma, and my great aunt out to go knock on peoples doors and talk about the bible, if this rings a bell to you, yes! they were Jehovahs Witnesses. I HATED IT. I was forced to go anyways because my mama had no one else to watch me whilst she was at work. So, we took a bit of a break, and they were heading to a “sisters” house. Jehovahs Witnesses call each other brother and sisters. Let me describe these women to you, my great grandmother was v 

My fiancé's family always have a big lunch each Sunday and when we started dating I was invited by his mum to attend. I said yes and she told me she would make me a vegetarian dish since I wouldn't be eating the meat. I would also get to meet my fiancé's older brother, John. Although I hadn't met John face to face, my fiancé told me enough about him so that I could be reasonably sure he was somewhere on the autism spectrum (I'm a mental health nurse so I recognised some of the behaviours) but had no formal diagnosis. He hardly spoke or left the house or made eye contact so I wanted to make sure 

Awhile back we had a family member in palliative care. So another family member who hadn't seen the ill relative in several years, flew in from elsewhere in the country and we offered him/her a place to stay. In short order, we were tearing our hair out over our guest's behaviour. The guest kept saying things like: “I can stay indefinitely.” This is the height of rudeness. Yes, you are in town to visit a terminally sick relative. But your hosts are also trying to visit and take care of the same dying loved one. The additional stress of a demanding houseguest on a self-declared open-ended stay i

My maternal grandma and this happened last week. I’ve already told the tale of “your Christmas tree looks like shit!” from my high school days which I look back on with humor. This latest incident I do not find funny. Last week, Grandma was on her last day staying with us (a two week stay) and my parents, sister and I thought it had gone really well. We’d all gotten along, had dinner together when we could as Sister and I are working full-time this summer (I work 50–60 hours a week easily between internship and my paying job) and generally, we all seemed to be in a good mood most of the time. W 

Although this event didn’t quite make it to having someone as a guest in my home, this one would probably kind of count. My sister complained about always having Christmas at her house, so I offered to have it at my newly built home. No big deal, we always figured she wanted to have it at her house because she was somewhat of a control freak. So in order to have Christmas dinner at my house, I made a stipulation of no smoking in my new home, with new carpet, new furniture, etc. I have mild asthma, but smoke is definitely a big trigger for me, and it doesn’t matter what kind of smoke. I was actua 

What are some things you would like to 'normalise'?
There are a lot of things I would like to normalise. Few of them are:- Talking about mental health- Being a person who suffers from stress and anxiety every now and then, I wish talking about mental health and normalizing it would be a great help to a large no. of people out there.Sex education- In a country like ours, it is very uncommon that you see the teachers comfortably teaching their students about sex(especially in co-ed schools). Moreover, only biology students have the privilege of sex education. It should be made a compulsory part of the school education system.Talking about sex abus

 Giving due respect to every profession. In my country, I have witnessed this at almost every walk of life. People give you respect when you are at a certain position at your job. Everybody can recall the Hitesha-Kamaraj case, where the lady allegedly treated the delivery guy in a disrespectful manner and called her a “Slave". If this is true, then it reflects an ugly face of our entitled generation. It is not just Hitesha, we probably might have misbehaved with somebody at some point , who could have been at the receiving end. How many times do you see waiters or delivery guys being treated wi

The awareness that positive human connection is the most precious quality in the world. If we could just work on rising above the hatred and separation we feel towards other humans in favour of mutual responsibility, we would be moving in the right direction. As long as society promotes competition and individual success at the expense of others, our world will continue to deteriorate. Rather than trying to fix climate change, deforestation, mental health, starvation and the endless other problems we face individually, focus on the cause of the problem. That root cause is the misuse of human na 

harshly criticizing people.  this is based on something i recently saw on tiktok, there was a group profile of, i think, 3–4 different people, and some dance while the other draw. anyways, one of them, that goes my "owner 1" so we'll call them one. one's dancing skills are not so good, terrible actually. and you'd think people would give advice? people would make jokes to where they should take the jokes. but no, they delete the comments and one of them made a video saying "i dont know why owner one gets a lot of hate." cruel for me to say yes but truth hurts. and if you're gonna put yourself on t 

What are some things you would like to normalize?  Let’s have a talk, shall we? Grab your boba and that blanket you’ve had for probably too long and discuss some things.  Male/Female relationships. Every time you see a movie, there’s usually a female and male main character. Let’s think about these two people…just for a second. What do you think will happen in the end? Will they A. Move on with their lives and just continue getting coffee together everyday B. End up in a relationship, because that’s how it’s supposed to be. If you said A, you’re probably wrong because for some reason society has forced 

A lot of things. No, I’m not joking, I’d like to normalize a lot of things. Especially within kids my age. Sex.Eww, right? Wrong. Sex is something normal that everyday people do. Stop acting like it’s some evil thing that Voldemort put a curse on (No offense, Harry) If we come to teenagers, They think of it as like a ‘quirk’ from MHA. Dude, chill out. Sex is a way to describe how intimate you are with that person, Not so you can brag to your friends. I really wish I could tell this to all my classmates but one half of the class would laugh, the other would start talking about their last night ex 

Women having body hair: I was scrolling through TikTok two months ago and saw a girl with a little bit of armpit hair, just dancing and lipsyncing, trying to send a valuable message through the caption of her video. The caption of the video said ‘’Armpit hair is cool.’’  Seems awesome, right? It seems ‘’the boys 🥶*’’ in the comment section didn’t think so.  I can’t comprehend how men having body hair is ‘’okay and natural’’ but women having body hair is ‘’obscene and indecent.’’ Can someone please explain that to me? Why is that so? Nobody bats an eyelash when they see a man with a body full of hai 

I would like to normalize the understanding that bullies do what they do as a PERFORMANCE of bravado, strength, and power, BECAUSE THEY FEAR they will be perceived as timid, weak and powerless if they fail to “prove” the opposite to their peers. Bullying is an attempt to “climb” the social ladder, and climbing is always an act of REACHING UP and pulling down. So, by definition then, the bully can only “climb” if the target of their bullying is someone they see as “strong enough to support them” in their climb. If this was widely understood, then the bully’s efforts become fruitless and even co

Doing romantic gestures for guys, such as giving them flowers.  (This was the only remote image I could find of a girl giving a flower to a boy, so I’m sorry that they’re so young. Blame Google.) I read this tumblr post some months ago:  but since then, I keep thinking about how sad it is. Why are flowers seen as feminine? When did nature have to only be liked by one sex? Shortly after this post, I asked my best guy friend what his favorite flower was, and big shocker, he likes flowers, too.  This makes me so disappointed in our society. For some reason, it’s the norm that men are supposed to make women 

Being a VirginMen are called studs when they sleep with multiply women, and women are called sluts when they sleep with a few men, but what happens to those who don’t sleep with anyone at all. They get outright shamed for it, pressured into sleeping with someone regardless of whether or not they actually like this person. It’s become a problem at this point, the word “Virgin” has a negative connotation attached to it when it shouldn’t. We have literally kids bragging about having sex while they’re in primary, and secondary school, of course it’s fake, but the fact that they think being a virgin

Feminists calling every person who supports men’s rights a misogynist. “You misogynist, chauvinistic pig!” How many men must have heard this? It is a common sentence that gets thrown at men a lot of times whenever they try to discuss the issues they face. Apparently, the term isn’t just reserved for men. There is a rising trend on Quora where ANY person who speaks up in support of men’s rights or decides to disagree with feminism is called a misogynist. I only realized this trend when I voiced my support towards men’s issues. For all the butthurt feminists of Quora, here is the definition of misog 

The mindset of men towards women in the Islamic Arab countries. I am not to write anonymously about this. And although I am completely aware that this answer may result in many troubles for me, but here I am, an example of an Arab ex-Muslim twenty-year-old girl whose trying to clarify, to some extent, what is happening to women in this part of the world. To be fair, I must note that, of course, every rule has its own exceptions, but I am going to point out to what's common in where I live through what I've seen and heard from incidents and struggles of many Arab women.

A week ago, I went to a photo studio to have a headshot taken. It was a little crowded so I had to sit and wait for my turn. A teenage girl came in wearing the traditional shalvar kameez along with a hijab. She looked like she was around 14 and she came with her father who was wearing the traditional dress as well. I suppose they had a reservation because their turn came first. The photographer told the girl to settle down while he set his camera. The girl took off her hijab and let down her hair. She was combing her hair when her father came storming in and told her to cover her head. The girl 

The fact people are willing to become ignorant and cruel just to defend an ideology. I think, contrary to many opinions, most people are actually good. At least, they stick to their morals. I saw this story about a girl getting raped in Pakistan as a pre-accorded revenge, in which her own family agreed. The girl could have ran away, yet she stayed. Her family could have said no, but for some reason, they didn't. Most of the individuals involved probably share a mindset, a sick mindset, but that doesn't mean they don't have the capacity to love or to feel. Still, what they did was horrible and d 

I get annoyed over little things although I hide my emotions well… When I greet someone with 'salaam alikum' and they don't reply back the proper way. Yes it happens. I meet some Muslims here in the UK and they don't even reply back the right way (wa alaykum salaam) and even if they do they usually think it is funny. I get so frustrated and angry about this but I keep quiet. Stop being embarrassed. I say it because usually I feel down and saying it and hearing a reply makes me feel better.Fake friendliness. One of the things I hate the most. I'd rather be mistreated than have people pretending 

Women claiming they want equality. It frustrates me to no end.  Instead of going on yet another diatribe, I’ll give a short explanation as to why this is definitely not what women should be asking for: Women can get pregnant, and when they do, they need time off to focus on their labour, and also time to recover from the pregnancy. They (and the child) also need the support of a man at that time. In most countries, men are not recognized for that role and don’t get time off, or at max about 2 weeks off. You really want us to start treating women the way we treat men?Although possible, due to phys

I'm writing anonymous due to the fact my mother is a frequent reader of quora. Colorful language ahead. I am currently 17 years old and living one of the dullest lives possible of an average teenager my age. I'm by no means a trouble maker at home nor am I at school. I'm a junior in highschool and my grades are pretty average aside from algebra because… its math. You may be wondering well what frustrates you? Its the fact that I can't enjoy the teenage life. You know this consist of the small things like going to the movies or maybe going to the mall with your friends. Or maybe even walking to t 

One of the things that frustrates me is the constant assertion that children who aren't smacked are not disciplined. Proponents of corporal punishment are under the illusion that all those of us who choose not to hit our children instead let them run wild, unchecked. They couldn't be more wrong. Yes there are some parents who either through laziness or ignorance don't discipline their offspring. Some even make a conscious decision to not instill any discipline at all. Ever. The “n” word (no) is a no-no. They think the child must learn to negotiate life through their own trials and errors. No rul

After the tweet, Aishwarya didn't care to reply or report this tweet but how could we people tolerate this. So, the shamming started.

“Not all men.”  Sarah Everard, a 33 year-old woman went missing while walking home in South London. She was found dead on March 12, just a few days later. A police officer has been charged with her murder. Sarah wore bright clothing. She called her boyfriend. She wore sensible shoes. She walked under well-lit streets. Covered every inch of skin. She did everything right.  And it still didn’t save her. The level of victim blaming around Sarah Everard is disgusting. People don’t get attacked because of what they wore, what they did, who they talked to or if they walked home alone. People get attacked be

In Israel, there was a pretty young bride with thick dark hair, a contagious laugh and a bubbly personality. We’ll call her Malka (a common Hebrew name, it means ‘queen’). Three months ago she became engaged to a handsome, earnest and smiling Yeshiva student who we’ll call Yonatan (Jonathan). They were introduced by Malka’s cousin who studied in Yeshiva (Jewish college of Torah study) together with Yonatan. They were friends - for years they used to hang out together, sometimes studying Torah and sometimes just chilling with some good Israeli music and some good Israeli beer. He knew well from  

I went to a destination wedding 12 years ago in the Caribbean as part of a short vacation trip that I took. I didn't know anyone but my traveling companion and her daughter; the rest of the wedding party were strangers to me. The bride looked beautiful, the weather was great, and everybody got along. It was actually one of the best weddings that I had ever attended and I was happy that I was allowed to be a part of it. After the ceremony at the wedding dinner, the bride announced that she was expecting and that brought applause and cheers from everyone except one person. What I didn't know (and  

Many years ago when I first started dating my husband his older brother was dating a girl that I just wanted to distance myself from. Now many people will understand when I say that his older brother is the first born, male, and the family was Italian and German, so he could do no wrong. He’s a great guy and I love him, but I sometimes get weary of his elevated status no matter what. Ok back to the chick; my husband’s father must have had a little crush on her too because by association she could do no wrong either even though she was pretentious, insulting and thought she was the smartest pers 

You will have to decide who was the rudest person at the wedding I am going to describe. A few years ago I worked with a young lady who was rather shy. She was one of these people that always wanted to please everyone, and got upset easy. I liked her a lot but felt like saying, calm down! Anyway I was invited to her wedding. I hadn’t been to that church, but I had heard that the Pastor liked to hear himself talk. I didn’t know what to make of that statement, but I sure found out! The service started out nice, it wasn’t a very big wedding, maybe 50 people. About half way through the service befor 

Going anonymous, so as not to embarrass a couple of the characters who are still living. My dad remarried in 2000, and he wanted to have a big, fancy reception for family and friends. It was held at a very nice location downtown. Drinks were readily available to those who might have wanted to imbibe, and at events like this of course there's always someone who does…. My dad had invited a neighbor-lady from across the street to come, but instead her 40-something son, whom we'll call “John”, and his date showed up. I recall him arriving with a big smile on his face. In no time, he was tossing down 

In the late 70s, I was invited to a what turned out to be a fairly fancy and expensive wedding reception. The lady (let’s call her J.) and I were early into our relationship, so I was aware that I wouldn’t know too many of the other guests. That would be a bit of a problem because J. was a member of the wedding party, and we would not be spending much of the evening together, not even at the same table for dinner. The Bride’s parents had really laid it on for their only daughter - the City’s finest Hotel Ballroom, tons of guests, excellent dinner, et cetera. All the guests were dressed up - the 

I was the maid of honor at my college friend's wedding. Everything went beautifully except for one moment during the reception. One of the first dances was supposed to be just for the wedding party; the groom with the bride, both sets of parents with each other, and all the attendants with their opposite-sex counterparts. While the dance was being announced, the best man - the groom's younger brother - slipped out and nobody could find him. He had ducked out of his own brother's reception just to avoid dancing one dance with me. I had only met him the day before, and we had barely exchanged a  

Didn’t (thank God) happen at any wedding I have been to, but I recall reading this one in the newspaper years ago when they published a collection of readers’ worst-thing-that-happened-at-my-wedding stories: Hands-down winner for me was one woman recounting her husband’s best man and (I guess) a close bud of the best man who was an usher as well. The two of them showed up to the ceremony already pretty drunk … it was all they could do to get these guys through it without too much disruption. Then came the pictures at some nearby park. Apparently they had brought along some flasks and renewed the 

Well, how about a string of things. I had major surgery 6 weeks before my daughters wedding. I spent my Six week recovery making the wedding and bridal party dresses and the last few days cooking for 200. My Dr. was pretty upset as I needed a second surgery. I had been in a roller coaster accident and he said that a sharp jar to my neck could sever my spinal cord. However, the wedding won. He gave me some heavy duty pain killers in case I needed them at the wedding. I had 6 oxycontin pills. I put them in my glove box just in case. I don’t take pain killers. I had a sister who was addicted to the 

I work as a wedding videographer so I’ve seen my fair share of obnoxious moments…but by far the most memorable one I’ve seen and heard was at a destination wedding I attended as a guest. The ceremony was perfect, the bride looked radiant—everything went without a hitch. During toasts, when it came to the bride’s older sister’s turn, she had a bunch of people roll up a projector screen in the middle of the ballroom. She started kicking up a fuss about why it was taking so long to set the whole thing up because the event planners were having a hard time connecting her laptop and project a powerpo 

Doctors: When you notice something in public such as a person with a suspicious mole, abnormal gait, or wet cough, do you ever approach them and suggest they have the issue checked out? If so, do you say you are a doctor?
I’m a failed medic. I trained in surgery and then went down the academic route and became a research fellow. Then went onto tutoring, teaching and examining. I have had a few civilian medical events which need a lot to pull me into as I am a very private person and don’t like the attention of getting involved. One was a guy in a hotel in Wales. A bunch of us stayed there as part of a huge consulting gig. This guy was also there as part of the ex-pat community. He had this really hacking cough every night. One evening in the bar he was almost coughing his guts up and I turned round, “You need to 

Most people do not like unsolicited advice, even from a doctor. I try to keep that in mind, but sometimes I still have to say or do something. My family was at lunch and I heard her before I saw her. Across the room, I was struck the unmistakeable “seal bark” cough associated with croup. The first cough stopped me mid-bite and I listened for strider. Of course, I heard nothing.

I’m a failed medic. I trained in surgery and then went down the academic route and became a research fellow. Then went onto tutoring, teaching and examining. I have had a few civilian medical events which need a lot to pull me into as I am a very private person and don’t like the attention of getting involved. One was a guy in a hotel in Wales. A bunch of us stayed there as part of a huge consulting gig. This guy was also there as part of the ex-pat community. He had this really hacking cough every night.

Have you ever accidentally seen your mother-in-law doing something she thought was private?
Quite a few years ago, my in-laws took their three sons and their families on a cruise to celebrate a milestone anniversary. I went with my mother-in-law to the bathroom after we had finished eating dinner. There were several stalls and there was a staff person in there as well. I don’t remember why she was there – maybe she was handing out paper towels. My mother-in-law went into the handicapped bathroom. I finished washing my hands so I was waiting for her just outside her stall. All of a sudden, this staff person accidentally leaned on the handicap button on the wall which opened the door -  

Lol! So many times. They were funny episodes. By nature iam very quiet and can sink into the corner of any room cuddling pillows and blankets. Technically I can blend into the decor without being noticed. This was 10 years ago when I was in my room and used to practice yoga and reiki studiously every day …. My mom in law wanted to try it and for 3 consecutive days she took reiki from me at night and slept soundly through the night without her insomnia pills. On the 4 th day she told me not to do any more reiki and she would manage. Evening as I was sitting in the room in one corner of the bed  

Last month, I got a surprise from my mother-in-law, what I was seeking over the years. In Feb, my mother-in-law came to visit us. She wanted a change of place and to see her son after a long time. One night, I woke up around 2 am to get a glass of water. My mother-in-law was walking in the living room. I got scared for a moment that why she is here at midnight. I asked about her health, she said, ‘She had light chest pain and feeling suffocated.’ Something wasn't good; I immediately called an ambulance. After hospitalization, the doctor said, she got a minor heart attack, and luckily, we admitted  

At first, yes. And my ex Mother-in-Law actually. I was 17 when I moved in with my ex-wife and her family.

The in laws bedroom was off of the living room and depending on where you sat and if the door was open, you could see certain parts of the bedroom. Well, I sat in the recliner usually having breakfast when I got home and several times, I saw her in various states of undress.

We ate at Panera. When the pager went off, I got up and retrieved our food. That’s when she did it. At our last stop, I went to pay for a clothing item and my $100 was missing.

As a matter of fact? I did. She has passed away as of 2006. So has her significant other. While visiting their home, we were bunking in the other part of their huge home and it had a split floor plan. I had been sleeping in late but I caught up and needed an aspirin so, I walked through the living room over to the other part of the house where she was giving him his meds. He had just gotten out of the hospital after having some type of heart surgery. She stood in front of him, handing him his pills.

What are 10 random facts about your best friend?
 THEME OF THIS ANSWER- WATER Warning• It's a huge answer, forgive me for I was too much into the answer such that it seemed to be more of a diary about ^ friends ^ more than an answer.  I don’t know if you refer to best friends in real life or online, so I’ll write 3 best friends in both categories mainly because i love all 6 of them from the bottom of my heart. I don’t have many friends, as i like to keep to myself a lot and also, less friends means less drama and less talks about fEeLiNgS.

She paints. For a bit the only thing she could talk about was gouache and how it wasn't coming fast enough.

What is the stingiest thing that you have seen a family member do?
I have a few here: My late ex in-laws had always struggled with money, although they both worked unbelievably hard. My father in law had suffered with polio as a young man and lived with terrible pain all of his life. He always worked through it all until they retired. Just being left with the UK state pension, life got even harder for them. My ex husband bought them an old caravan, which they lovingly did up and it became their pride and joy. Their first holiday with it was only about 20 miles away from their home, but they were really excited to be getting away even though they had no spendin 

My father lived with me for 5 years rent free. Never even mentioned money after his then wife turned 62 cashed in on his social security, and left his ass. She won’t divorce him. Anyways we had a small liquor store. The liquor store was doing ok but not great, Obama took office, my construction career tanked and the liquor store kept us going till it didn’t in 2011. We had a baby in 2011 and we sold the store, we didn’t lose any money but we didn’t have a way to turn that money over, anyhow I started selling the pills I received from my doctor to help with the bills. Eventually that was a bust 

I have a cousin that is notoriously cheap that it has become a running joke in our family. Once she came to to stay with my family for two weeks where we cooked, took her out for meals, drove her to locations she wanted to see and catered to her. She knew I wanted a wine rack as I had been shopping for one with her a few days prior. I worked this day and came home and she had bought me one. How thoughtful! I was unsure though if it was a gift or not so I asked her what I owed her. She told me $80!! Okay, more than I wanted to spend for something I didn’t pick out but I paid her because luckily

Early in my marriage, my husband told me that he’d be set for life because his parents were very well off (when his father dies, he’ll inherit close to a million dollars, as will his brother and sister). He’s a CPA who does his dad’s taxes and handles financial matters for him, and I’ve seen some of the paperwork, so I know that this is true. Both of his parents were Depression-era babies, as were mine. The big difference between the two sets of parents is that my parents decided early on that they would rather help out my brother and me while they were still alive so that they could see the di

I know that because she often took me with her. Bills often didn’t get paid, and when

Despite this, I bought grandma nice gifts (around $100 for them), mainly because she was getting up there in age and I wanted to make sure she had a nice holiday. When it came time to give me a gift, she went into a back room and emerged with an unwrapped shoebox. When I opened it, there was a used extension

During the election I supported Trump as I felt like he would stop the rise of China (although he didn’t actually do so it was the Coronavirus that stopped it), even when he said “grab ‘em by the p—y” in that video I still supported him over Hillary. It started to go downhill soon after the election and when he told people in “Upper New York” to go to Wisconsin I started to see him negatively.

What was the point where Trump 'crossed the line' for you? If by ‘crossed the line’ we mean ‘did something inexcusable’, then I’d say it was this: In 1984 (Yes, that long ago!) a cabinet builder called Edward Friel Junior accepted a contract to build furniture for a casino. The estimate for that contract was $400,000 - even more by today’s money. The contract was duly completed and the furniture installed at Harrah’s Trump Plaza location. Did he see that money? Hell no. He got $86,000. That’s about 21% of what he was owed. This massive shortfall basically destroyed his company. He was not alone.

What is the fastest way you've seen a co-worker get fired?
Short version: Guy who worked there for less than a week got fired for stealing another employee's debit card information. Long version: When I worked overnights at a Holiday gas station, we would constantly have issues with getting people hired. So whenever we did get someone, they were effectively deemed irreplaceable, at least until a replacement could be found. Case in point, one of the (many) people hired and fired during my time there lasted several months. He was caught several times on camera stealing cigarillos, various other tobacco products, and food. This went on for a few months. Th 

I did NOT necessarily see a co-worker get fired- but one suddenly disappeared without anyone being aware of what happened at first. Back when I was working as a night crew stocker at Albertson's- this guy almost 10 years older than me had been hired to take the place of an African-American who had recently quit (because that one almost got fired for sneaking upstairs and taking naps while on the clock). That new guy acted okay at first- and then he all of a sudden started being a real jerk. He would get really “smart alecky"- and even started to mouth off at me while we were working. I came in  

I have seen 4 in my life: Flirting with a female collegue. Manager didn't like that. Asked the female collegue to email him, on their personal relationship. (Your employer must know, if you have any personal relationship with another employee in the organisation). The girl writes that this guy clings onto her, tries to woo her, and annoys her. On the basis of the email, the guy gets fired on the grounds of sexual harassment. 2 year later, we discover, the manager and the lady is having an affair. In fact, she got H1B as well, but at US immigration she gave some absurd answer on her “purpose of 

I've seen not one but two co-workers getting fired. It was in 2018, I was working in a BPO company. The company had an OT policy that anyone who's logged into the system for 11 hours will be considered as 9 hours of regular work, OT for 2 hrs and would pay you for that. Let me tell you, you've to be logged into the system, not necessarily be working and no permission from Team leader or manager was required to do OT. Technically you've to be working in those 2hrs also but since permission was not required from anyone to stay after shift this became a loophole to earn OT money without doing wor 

Back in my previous organization, there was no concept of firing. There were multiple projects and if you performed badly, you were released from the project. One would have to wait to get a call from a different project. While many wishes to get a release from the worst projects, to some getting a release is equivalent to getting fired and they don't want that for obvious reasons.  There was only one team member in my previous organization who stayed with the project ever since its inception. All the other team members have joined the project mid-way and needless to say, his experience had made

A friend and I were hired to work in a warehouse. Frank loved beer, if he wasn’t drinking beer he was eating Valium to calm his nerves. It’s our first day, the boss is watching us like he was in a guard tower making sure the prisoners didn’t escape. Had a shrapnel stare - went right through you. We were doing fine except that Frank was at the water cooler every 30 minutes washing down a Valium. Boss comes running over and wants to know what’s going on. Frank shows him a prescription bottle of Valium. He’s 26 years old and seemingly healthy. The boss is incredulous. I know we ain’t gonna last t 

It was happened in December 2019. We all joined in Wipro and in our batch contains one high experienced person too.  He was very excited about Wipro and he asked us to click a picture of him in Wipro campus and he posted in each and every social media he had. We all supposed to attend a 15 days mandatory training and during those time we all became friends and we exchanged our numbers too. His whatsapp status at the end of the day would be one pic of him in the Wipro campus . I hope he impressed that girl from his whatsapp status.

For 13 years i worked in the drilling industry, it was pretty hard, very much a male dominant industry, hard, long hours, heavy work and pretty dirty. This was on jack-ups (semi mobile offshore rigs) In 12 hours sometimes you wouldn't get a tea break depending on what was happening so you took what you could. As some ex military once explained, it was like the basic training in the army but for the rest of your life and they quit after 2 days which was quite weird. Anyway, to the question. If you were lucky enough to get a tea break you had to measure a 15 minute break in some way because if one 

Late 90s/early 2000s I worked in a computer factory. Specifically, I was in the secure cage with all the high value components - processors, memory, and Certificate of Authenticity (COA) labels. The little hologram stickers you get on genuine Microsoft products. These things cost very little to make, but were hideously expensive to replace if they got damaged or went missing/stolen. They came to us in packs of 100, ten strips of ten labels. So, one Monday afternoon, we get a couple of new guys in to work a 3pm-10pm shift. Guy from the training department comes in to give them the basics of how t

I'd heard of this bloke called donald trump who was hosting a show called The Apprentice in which he got to deliver a two-word tirade. I ignored both the man and the show. That was until in marched 2016 and from that point forward in no particular order, trump evoked a cascade of casual insults, flung from the protected distance of a Twitter account, a radio show and a campaign platform. trump, the presumptive Republican chosen one for president: corrupting, generic, impersonal, performed. The first line he crossed was the moment he painted himself into a corner: He never would catch up on his pr 

THE point? There are so many! One in particular, however… Was a case of a modern day lynching that took place in New York City. The Central Park Jogger Case was a frightening episode that took place 4/19/1989. From the wiki: Trisha Meili was going for a regular run in Central Park shortly before 9 p.m.[8][12] While jogging in the park, she was knocked down, dragged nearly 300 feet (91 m) off the roadway,[13] and violently assaulted.[6] She was raped and beaten almost to death.[14] About four hours later at 1:30 am, she was found naked, gagged, and tied, and covered in mud and blood, in a shallow rav 

I grew up in northeast New Jersey, about 10 minutes from the George Washington Bridge leading from New Jersey into New York City. When I was in High School, I had a few friends whose parents worked white-collar jobs in the construction industry. Not construction workers I mean, executives, upper management for the larger builders in the Tri-State area (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut) It was around that time that Donald Trump was really making a name for himself, building casinos in Atlantic City, he had recently bought an ownership stake in the New Jersey Generals USFL team, he was well know 

Please bare with me for the long introduction. I’m a software programmer. And also a businessman. I have (and had) companies of my own. And I also worked for some companies. As such, I’ve been hired and fired (well, “laid off”, but it’s the same thing), and I also have done hiring and firing (well, “laying off”, but again, same thing) myself. Out of the four, there no better experience than being hired. And not worse experience than firing someone. In my very own experience, firing someone is the worst experience I’ve ver had in the workplace. It’s much worse than being fired. If nobody has fired 

Trump crossed all sorts of lines long before he decided to run for president: Trump was a bully as a boy and was sent to a military academy after his father caught him with a collection of switchblades. At the academy, Trump attempted to throw a classmate through a window, according to witnesses. Trump’s older sister, a future federal judge, did his homework for him. Trump paid a ringer to take his SAT test. Trump claimed to have finished first in his class at Wharton, but the college gives out awards to top students and their names were published by a newspaper.

What is the stingiest thing that you have seen a family member do?
I have a few here: My late ex in-laws had always struggled with money, although they both worked unbelievably hard. My father in law had suffered with polio as a young man and lived with terrible pain all of his life. He always worked through it all until they retired. Just being left with the UK state pension, life got even harder for them. My ex husband bought them an old caravan, which they lovingly did up and it became their pride and joy. Their first holiday with it was only about 20 miles away from their home, but they were really excited to be getting away even though they had no spendin 

My father lived with me for 5 years rent free. Never even mentioned money after his then wife turned 62 cashed in on his social security, and left his ass. She won’t divorce him. Anyways we had a small liquor store. The liquor store was doing ok but not great, Obama took office, my construction career tanked and the liquor store kept us going till it didn’t in 2011. We had a baby in 2011 and we sold the store, we didn’t lose any money but we didn’t have a way to turn that money over, anyhow I started selling the pills I received from my doctor to help with the bills. Eventually that was a bust 

I have a cousin that is notoriously cheap that it has become a running joke in our family. Once she came to to stay with my family for two weeks where we cooked, took her out for meals, drove her to locations she wanted to see and catered to her. She knew I wanted a wine rack as I had been shopping for one with her a few days prior. I worked this day and came home and she had bought me one. How thoughtful! I was unsure though if it was a gift or not so I asked her what I owed her. She told me $80!! Okay, more than I wanted to spend for something I didn’t pick out but I paid her because luckily

Early in my marriage, my husband told me that he’d be set for life because his parents were very well off (when his father dies, he’ll inherit close to a million dollars, as will his brother and sister). He’s a CPA who does his dad’s taxes and handles financial matters for him, and I’ve seen some of the paperwork, so I know that this is true. Both of his parents were Depression-era babies, as were mine. The big difference between the two sets of parents is that my parents decided early on that they would rather help out my brother and me while they were still alive so that they could see the di 

My mother always behaved like she was entitled to the best of everything, and thought the bare minimum was good enough as far as other people. She insisted on holding her husband’s paycheck as well as her own, deciding how the money would be used before he even had access to it. She’d say she was depositing both paychecks into the bank account, but actually she cashed them and spent the money as she pleased, then hid some in her purse for later, depositing whatever was left (if anything) when she was finished. I know that because she often took me with her. Bills often didn’t get paid, and when  

My ex-husband’s grandmother was a millionaire but she was the cheapest person I’ve ever met. As an example, one year, we went to her house for Christmas and were exchanging gifts. At the time, I was supporting my whole family because my ex was a deadbeat and we were just making ends meet. Despite this, I bought grandma nice gifts (around $100 for them), mainly because she was getting up there in age and I wanted to make sure she had a nice holiday. When it came time to give me a gift, she went into a back room and emerged with an unwrapped shoebox. When I opened it, there was a used extension

I’m from a family with 8 children with a tradition of getting together monthly at each other’s homes to share a meal and socialize. Once we all had significant others it was normal to have about 16 adults plus children attending. The person hosting would provide the place, the dinnerware and beverages and everyone would bring a dish to share. It was always a feast with most of us bringing at least one if not more items. My oldest sister, although she was always one to parade her success making sure we knew she was well traveled, had important friends and luxury items, was always the cheapest. H 

After my mother had back surgery, she had to walk 2 miles a day. Of course, she lives in the country and the weather doesn't always behave in Oklahoma. My aunt Kathy, her sister in law, had a treadmill that she hadn't used, but for a catch all, in so long, the dust was thick, and there were cobwebs. My uncle Jimmy, mother's little brother, knew she needed a treadmill and was going to sell it to mother, at a MUCH discounted price than if mother had to get a new one. Uncle Jimmy knew aunt Kathy hadn't used it in years, and thought she would be glad to be rid of it, get it out of the way. Oh no,

Why are there women who suddenly decide never to become mothers? What do you think about it?
Feifei wrote a great answer! And this is my story. When I was 19 when I decided I didn’t want to be a mother, but I also thought that 19 was too young to be certain. So when I was 25, I discussed it with a counselor for a couple of sessions—my research to see if the counselor could suss out some hidden ideas or fears. And then I had a tubal ligation. The first doctor I spoke to about this (recommended by a co-worker) admitted that he made the appointment with me to talk me out of my choice. We had never met before that day, but he was certain he knew better than I did what was good for me. This  

Super response, Feifei Wang . I am one of those women as well. Unlike others, I didn’t know I didn’t want any children until I was a bit over 20…the question just never came up aside from the fear when my cycle was irregular (which it always was). Because I wasn’t certain that I never wanted children, I took birth control pills. When my anger about having to take those while men didn’t really have to pay attention to anything (this was before HIV) grew too big, I switched to an IUD where I suffered bad pain for the whole time until I had it removed. So I thought about having children and thought  

I’m one of the women who decided not to have children. It’s not a sudden decision. I knew since teenager I don’t want to be a mother, and that feeling had never changed over the years. Never a moment when I thought babies are cute and I want to devoted years of my life to changing diapers. Mostly I think I’m a very selfish person with a ginormous ego. Both of my parents are absentee parents. I don’t think I’m good mother material. I can’t give a child what they need from good parents, and I don’t want to put a child through what I’ve been through. And I don’t think my genetic material is that spe 

For the same reason that there are men that never want to be fathers. No man or woman is obligated to become a father or mother. It is personal choice. If either don’t want a child in their life that is up to them, their business and nobody else’s. I get sick and tired of people (not talking about you but in general) that feel the need to stick their nose in and have an opinion on this when it is none of their business and they have no right to even have one word leave their mouth about a man choosing not to become a father or a woman a mother. So what do I think when men or women choose not to b 

I doubt that many (if any) women “suddenly” decide this. But lots of women (and men) decide not to be parents, for a variety of reasons: Their financesTheir personalities.Their careers.just off the top of my head. What do I think about it? I think it’s great. I mean, I’ve known I wanted to be a dad since before I knew how that happened, but parenting well is hard. Not everyone wants to do it and not everyone is able to do it and, if you are in one of those groups, you shouldn’t have kids. Far too many people have kids without being ready, willing and able. NOTE: I left off the ecological/overpopul 

I believe we’ve two questions there. The second question is easy to answer. I don’t think about women who don’t want to be mothers. It’s not a big deal.

Do you even really like kids, or do you feel out of your element when interacting with them. When you sit with a child are the first words out of your mouth “Sooooo... how was your day?”. If so, that's a red flag. They are atrociously expensive. Can you afford to do this on your own? Even if you have a partner, there is no guarantee they will be there for you tomorrow. They could leave. Or they could die in a car crash. Do you have the physical energy for this plus a job? How physically healthy are you really? You will get way less sleep than you ever did and will be perpetually exhausted. What 

Maybe because of this?  Image credit [1] I’m not saying that a bunch of women have looked at the world population and made a conscious decision not to have children. However, there isn’t a pressing need for more children on the planet. We aren’t running out of humans anytime soon. Birth control allows women to choose when and if they want children and they can devote their lives to other things if they want without being celibate. A lot of women are deciding that motherhood isn’t for them and they are using birth control to ensure their choice. Things often change when technologies change. Birth cont 

For me it was not a sudden decision. I knew from the time I was an older child and preteen that I never wanted to marry or have children. My parents didn’t have a happy marriage and my mother seemed to genuinely dislike and resent having children so I saw no benefits to it. Instead I have had a very stimulating and rewarding career doing the thing I love to do the most: draw. I can’t speak for all other women, but I think that choosing to remain childless (or child-free) is a profoundly personal choice based on individual circumstances, tastes and situations. Women should not be forced to give bir 

I’m 43. I don’t have kids. It isn’t always necessarily all or nothing, do or die or because of this or that. I have an alternative lifestyle and traditional parenting just hasn’t lined up with the other things I do and want in life, but I haven’t felt the need so strongly that it warrants dropping or altering everything to “have children”. I’m most certainly receptive to adopting, foster care, stepping, or figuring out something later in life should the opportunity present itself. But this “clock” everyone keeps talking just has never gone off inside me so to speak… it’s just always been a moot i

Most of the EU citizens are now reluctant to use the AstraZeneca vaccine due to the negative coverage of this vaccine by the EU. Why is EU demanding more of this vaccine when it has been stockpiling millions of vaccine already only to get wasted?
As the finance director of the Roman Catholic Church said when asked the wealth of said Church “only God knows!” Is it because they want to paint the UK as the cause of all EU ills, when really its a European made f2ck up. Desperate to stop the EU going the way of the USSR. Scapegoating Britain will not save Europe from a self-made disaster Language matters. The Commission’s Ursula von der Leyen states that the EU has shipped 10 million vaccines to the UK – and another 30 million to the rest of the world – but has yet to receive a single vaccine in exchange. The EU has done no such thing. The Ame 

I don’t know the exact statistics, but I don’t think it’s most - a significant minority, definitely. It really does beggar belief. The EU (and European states, both EU and non-EU alike) rubbish the vaccine and rubbish AstraZeneca to the extent that people don’t want to use it and more then seven million doses sit in store rooms unused… …Then they claim to have a shortage of vaccines, and that AstraZeneca is to blame for the bungled EU vaccine programme - despite the fact that the EU’s stock of unused doses is increasing, the speed of the vaccine programme is dropping, and three quarters of the st 

To the EU it is a race which the EU is losing. The EU doesn’t like losing, so it wants to trip up the team in front. I’m, not sure that the dosed will be wasted, but the main objective is to stop the companies form sending them to the customer who has ordered and paid for them. The EU, having initially shot itself in the foot by threatening to set up a hard border on the island of Ireland, has now shot itself in the other foot and one hand. It is so busy trying to hinder the UK because it left the club and is doing well, so full of hatred for the UK, that it has forgotten that The UK gambit of giv

Thanks for the A2A Deepak. If you happen to have access to Continental press, you’ll find that the coverage of the AZ vaccine is pretty factual, contrary to the British press. Nevertheless it appears that the AZ firm has been less than transparent as to its deliveries and contracts, as well as test data. Stockpiles of tens of millions have just been discovered hidden in some EU plants, while AZ was claiming it couldn’t honour its EU delivery commitments. To date AZ have been unclear as to the destination of those hidden stockpiles. There are rumours (just rumours !) that they were to be shipped to 

Seldom has such a short question been so full of errors in fact. Most EU citizens are not reluctant to use AstraZeneca vaccine. Up to 60% are worried it is unsafe but that is not the same as “reluctant to use.” Most would take it if offered.Negative coverage of vaccine was by media leaping on a sensational story not the EU.EU is demanding that contracts are filled not demanding more vaccines.EU is not stockpiling nor wasting vaccines.The EU has contacted for 1.2 bn doses. So more than 2 each person.

I don’t know about other European countries, but in Belgium, the explanation about stockpiles of AstraZeneca vaccine is that it’s not possible to plan in advance (i.e. to decide who gets how much vaccines, to send invitations and so on), because of the total lack of trustworthiness of AstraZeneca’s delivery schedules. Obviously, if one has to wait until the vaccines have arrived to commence the whole process of planning and delivery, there will be stockpiles, as it takes some time (two to three weeks) to do that. Also, the link posted by the OP does not say anything about stockpiles or wasting  

The EU has given the AstraZeneca vaccine positive coverage through its medicines authority which gave the vaccine a thumbs up. It is the US FDA that has brought up concerns about the veracity and timeliness of AstraZeneca’s reporting To date AstraZeneca is not approved for even emergency use in the USA. Further, the strange explanations as to why there were 29 million doses in Italy that would, if delivered to the EU, would put AstraZeneca in compliance with their contractual delivery schedule, makes EU citizens suspicious. 51 views · View upvotes1James StraitonAnswered March 18, 2021 · Author has 267 answers and 99.1K answer views

The contract is with the EU and it is reasonably just trying to receive what it bargained for. It is up to the individual member countries if they want to waste their supplies.

The front desk clerk didn’t look like whatever stereotype I had of a rural Arizonan: she was about 19 years old, had facial piercings, dyed black hair, and a vaguely victorian black dress. She was very nice, though, and I asked her if she was a nat

Fortunately everything was prepaid We stayed at a casino in Minnesota 2 days earlier and over spent . My ex wife , soon to be my 3rd wife Was praying we would run into some luck . After checking in we went to our room To rest 2 days on the road. Traffic jam coming into Vegas delayed us 3 hours and of course the room was non smoking 105 degrees outside . We went back down to the desk got a new room . The new room is nice very clean , smoking overlooking the strip . Having managed 

Many years ago I had a job that required occasional travel in the area. One night while staying in Cedar Falls, Iowa I checked into a hotel we regularly used if I was staying in town. While in the bathroom brushing my teeth I looked up and noticed that one of the ceiling tiles of the drop ceiling was askew and I could see something sticking out where the tile didn't settle into the frame. I climbed up on the counter and moved the tile and pulled out the object which turned out to be a large zip-lock bag full of marijuana! This was in the late 70s and it was definitely not legal. I was and still a 

I lived in Houston, Texas from 1982 until 1985 in my early/mid 20's. In 2015 I planned a trip back to my old stomping grounds in the Galleria area of Houston on Beverly Hills Drive, just a few blocks outside of the 610 LOOP in celebration of my 30 years anniversary of moving back to Birmingham, Alabama in February 2015 ! A [[ it was a nostalgic gift to myself I guess]] at that time in 1982 till 1985 Houston was a bustling place; just like it is today, and I made a reservation to stay at a hotel near where I once lived. (Boy was I surprised to see how much Houston had changed since 1985) - ever 

My husband and I were traveling to Honduras for a dive trip. We had a really strange route because we had previously paid for round-trip tickets from Honolulu to Miami via Chicago. They were non-refundable so we just tacked on a flight to San Pedro Sula with a connecting flight onwards to Roatan Island. (Bear with me; I’ll get to the answer eventually.) After a really exhausting flight to Miami, our plane to Honduras was several hours late departing. Once in Honduras we boarded this tiny plane to fly over the mountains and out to Roatan Island. I was excited and had my “explorer” hat on. We start 

in 1997, we went on a week long vacation that started with the first night in New Orleans. After a day of sightseeing and enjoying the French Quarter, we went to our motel where we checked in and went to the room. When I opened the door, the hair on the back of my neck stood straight up. For some reason, I felt uneasy about this room. I stopped my family outside the door and made them wait until I checked the room. When I went on in the room I found the tv was on, there was a light coming from under the bathroom door and then I heard someone in the bathroom. I started backing out the door when

What made you upset today? I left Quora because I wanted to escape from the negativity of people online. But darn it something big happened and it pissed me off so much I had to come back and write about it. The incident I'm talking about is:  Brie Larson has made a YouTube channel Now why do I hate this? Is it because I hate Brie Larson? No, I'm a fan of Brie Larson. Do I hate the idea of her having a YouTube channel? No, I don't mind it. In fact, I think it's great. I think more celebrities should have YouTube channels. I feel like we never see their real personality. We're always seeing their c 

The murder of 2 year old James bulger.  I don’t know how to write this, there’s genuinely tears running down my face. As a true crime writer, this rarely happens. James Patrick Bulger, born on the 16th March, 1990, Merseyside - England. He was 2 years old, nearly 3, just a couple of weeks near to his birthday at the time of his murder. On February the 12th, 1993. Denise Bulger (James’s mother) went with James and a friend to a shopping centre/mall, New strand shopping centre. They went around shopping, talking. Etc. Until Denise stopped at a butchers in the shopping centre, turning her back to pay 

Y’all know Joaquin Pheonix, our beloved Joker who won oscar at the 92nd Academy Awards. During his acceptance speech, Phoenix talked about environment issues, animal rights, human rights, diversity and other burning topics that has plagued the world. Most interestingly, Phoenix also recalled his late brother River Phoenix.   ● Speech - I’m full of so much gratitude now. I do not feel elevated above any of my fellow nominees or anyone in this room, because we share the same love – that’s the love of film. And this form of expression has given me the most extraordinary life. I don’t know where I’d be 

Instagram… Yes you read it right, Instagram made me upset today. I don't use Instagram much but as today I was scrolling down I came across an Instagram handle which posted hyper realistic photos of famous artists like youtuber,actors and everyone who is trending right now. Below is the profile.  Being a person who have a little knowledge about sketching, it was clear to me that they are just black and white photos highly photoshopped to look like sketches. As a human being it was my prime responsibility to clarify with this person before taking any actions. So I messaged this person. Below are o 

I was going through social media when I read this news about Kim Jon’s decision on pet animals. First, I thought it might be fake as my eyes couldn’t believe it, so I checked online, and it was true. It’s all over the internet.  So basically North Korea is facing food crises which is why it’s leader decided to take this step. We are all aware of the strict rules in the country and how people are being treated there, but this act of their leader is ferocious.   Food crisis is definitely a big problem to be dealt with, and many countries are facing it and I am sure they are finding measures to prevent

What's something silly that made you smile today?
The vendor asked for kachoris in exchange for a balloon and a toy. So I did a very unethical thing, I stole them from the stall. Maybe inspired by the movie - “Now You See me".  When I was in 2nd or 3rd grade, I don't exactly remember when but I and my little brother (who is a year younger than me) had gone to a nearby house inauguration with our parents. It was a nice event where all delicious dishes were being served. It was a buffet system.

What happened wasn’t silly, but it was a silly reason for smiling. For the past month, one thing after the other has been breaking around the house—big stuff.

In the course of installing the new pool pump, the contractor found that the electrical connection had been fried so I had to call an electrician. The electrician found the damage around the pump then had to look at the main electrical panel of the house. You guessed it…it was fried and n

As the school got over, I left the school premises and started walking towards parking lot where I usually park my s

A QR code and an email address were printed on the bottom left corner—for those who wanted to participate in their study (I'm assuming). I didn't think much of its bolded message. I washed my hands and dried them with a paper towel on my way out. I sat down and opened my laptop.

Time was of the essence and I knew I was wasting time standing in the same spot looking silly. While I stood there trying to figure out my next move, the principal came outside to introduced himself and said, “take the next shoes off”, I look 

What statistics will make me feel like my whole life was a lie?
Hmmm… What if boys in school are being oppressed? What if modern women’s oppression isn’t…entirely real? What if I were to tell you that the average boy in the retro age of 2000 in school is about a year and a half behind the average girl in reading and writing? In 1997, school enrollments of boys were at a 45% compared to the 55% of females. In an article called The War Against Boys, written by Christina Hoff Sommers, published in 2000 in The Atlantic, I found this: Girls, allegedly timorous and lacking in confidence, now outnumber boys in student government, in honor societies, on school newspaper 

Gini-coefficient AKA Income Inequality is not what you think. Denmark is one of the richest countries in the world, it’s also one of the most equal countries in the world about 0.25, by comparison, the US is about 0.415. The GDP in Denmark is about $60k per capita, the GDP in the US is about $65k per capita. This is how it looks like with actual number (Decile = 10%) (same year numbers):  1% US: $421k 1% Denmark: Under $200k So it’s by far easier for a person in Denmark to go from making $32k in the 2nd decile, to entering the middle class at around $45k, than a person in the US going from $25k to $4 

The very statistic most commonly used and promoted as reality when it really does not exactly fit most real world situations, In such cases, those real world situations are manipulated by the statistician, using math (more statistical methods) in order to massage the data to make it conform to the standard distribution model so this now adjusted data can then be used to apply the standard distribution statistical model and testing procedures just as if it were a standard distribution. Even using the supposedly standard distribution the markers chosen to demonstrate correlation are still chosen  

A very scary IQ statistic. The US army started measuring IQ in the 20th century as a way to identify whether recruits were intelligent enough to survive and perform on the battlefield. After several years of trials, the upper command unveiled a guideline that new recruits to the US Army had to have an IQ of 83 or above to be considered for acceptance. So the people who didn’t hit 83 IQ were considered to be “incompetent” to the point where putting them on the battlefield would endanger the lives of their comrades. Basically, they couldn’t be trusted to do anything in the Army. But in the broader so 

In 2017 it was estimated there were 7,530,000,000 people alive on the the planet. The total number of people to have ever lived is currently around 107,000,000,000,000. How many can you name? Take your time. Write them down. All the most significant people you can think of. Now realize that, statistically, all the people you think are important that have ever lived are completely insignificant. Moreover, you aren’t even on the same level as the people you listed. The number of people who would put your name on that list of “how many people can you name?” is smaller than the list of people on you 

 The good ol’coin toss. The next time you and another party are flipping a coin, to decide who has to do some unfavorable action, remember this: The odds aren’t 50:50. Researchers at Stanford used a mechanical coin flipper to study which side the coin tended to land on. Heads didn’t perform better than tails. Tails didn’t perform better than heads. But - one side did perform better. The side that was facing up. If heads are facing up at the start of the toss. It had a 51% chance of landing on heads. Tails? Same story.  I wish you luck with this information. Also, it’s been found that flipping a coin c 

In terms of statistics, whenever tested, down through history, the probability that life only comes from life has always been 100% true. If your whole life has been based on the lie that evolution is true, that life came from chemicals which turned into a germ, a shell, an amphibian, a reptile, a bird or horse, an ape, and finally you, you may feel relieved to know that you actually have such great value and purpose because God made you so very special, that He was willing to die for you if you’d prefer not to go to Hell when you die.

I am more than sure that things will be more than bad than they are for example at least. The whole education system doesn't really work anyway and it doesn't really measures people achievments nor it makes them to achieve and discover something really really new. All this Noble prizes and so on which getting awarded each year seems to me like a whole fake if not worse. See my point ? I am totally lost really no matter how do you put it.

Research shows how more than 80% of our decisions are taken in the safe place of our hidden subconscious.We humans like to think to be in charge. Of our decisions. Choices. Life. It’s just not true. Most of what runs the show of our life is out of sight, in our subconscious. And what is there?Mostly beliefs, attitudes and patterns absorbed by close family, community and society based on a brain that is wired as if we still lived in caves and little tribes. And nope.

My 6 year old daughter shouted to me that she needed glue. I went into her room &amp; she was sat on her bed, with what I thought was paper &amp; pens. I moved to give her the glue &amp; to help her as the pens kept rolling off the bed &amp; I could see she was getting annoyed. As I got to the bed I realised it wasn’t paper she had but pages out of her photo album. She was scribbling out pictures of her father on the pages it was the 3 of us and on the pages of just the 2 of them she had cut out pictures of me &amp; placed them on top to stick down, hence wanting the glue.

My son was 3 years old and it was his nursery school’s graduation day. It was a beautiful spring day and the ceremony was being held outdoors. All us parents were waiting anxiously to see our children make their appearance. All of a sudden we heard the music of pomp and circumstance playing and out came the children wearing their caps and robes walking in a straight line towards the front rows to take their seats. The ceremony commenced with the principal praising how well all the children did the whole year and how much they accomplished, yadda, yadda, yadda. Then all the children got up and

When my daughter was ten I overheard her talking to someone in her room. At first I thought she was on the phone until I heard what she said :“Its quiet here now. Nobody talks, nobody laughs, and Mom wont stop crying. Can you hear me? I need you to come home.” I knocked softly on her door and when she opened it, I asked who she was talking to. She looked down and whispered “my brother”. Her brother had died 2 weeks before this. Edit. This wasn't recent, it happened back in 1994, but I sincerely thank you for your kind, heartfelt comments.

Not me personally, this is from a documentary I saw called Failing Jeffery. The movie focuses on the child abuse death of Jeffery Baldwin, who died when he was 5.

What's it like to have your spouse cheat on you?
It's like driving your car and having someone cut you off, which runs you off the road; your car flips multiple times before coming to a stop. As you come out of a traumatic trance, you only to begin to take inventory of the real damage in the aftermath of the wreckage.  My wife had been cold for months. We were in our fourth year of marriage, but each successive year seemed to be an unraveling of our love into something that I could no longer recognize.  While we were dating, my ex was the BEST girlfriend I ever had. She saw me through an estrangement from my brother, my mother, the loss of a j 

Shorter answer: It feels catastrophic for a while, but the feeling subsides over time. It can indeed make you stronger. Longer answer: I figured out that my wife was cheating on me through a variety of avenues. Ultimately, it depended on me coming out of a state of denial and facing the shock. The first concrete evidence was a stash of letters. There was a cast of names that I didn't fully recognise at first, but I came to see that they were regulars on an online bulletin board site we both liked. The letters had a combination of breathless excitement over her new online BFFs, disdain fo

She says none of her friends know, but I feel like everybody she knows or that he knows might have  

It's like someone takes your world, everything you knew to be true, and completely tears it asunder. You panic, you're scared, you can't believe it, your whole existence seems surreal in the worst possible way. Even if your marriage was troubled, like mine was, you don't expect it.  For two years, my husband and I had been struggling to (or so I thought) repair our marriage. We had young children, we were both making big life transitions - him to an extremely demanding job, me to a role as a stay at home mother. We'd lost some of our connection - I'd been responsible for 99% of the care of our c

The first time I was cheated on, I encountered it by accident - my long-term boyfriend had left his Gmail open on my computer after using it when he was sick, and I stumbled onto notifications for active sexting apps. There was a whole story he fed me about how his friend set him up as a joke, even got the friend to text me, and similar, but not long after I discovered unshakeable evidence.

Like my whole world crashed down on me. I was physically sick and couldn't eat. Lost 10 lbs in a few weeks. I was angry and jealous. I was hurt, I felt inadequate, and completely alone. Just devasted. We'd been married for 5 yrs, together for 7. We had 2 little boys together. We never really got along all that great. We had our good times though, and I honestly loved him and felt like I put 100% in our relationship and marriage. He had his anger and drinking issues. I just tried and tried to help him. Told him many a time that he needed to stop drinking and try to communicate more with me. He w 

In my situation I did not find out until many months after the cheating occurred. Initially, I had allegations from friends that, yes, it was true, I had been cheated on! I basically questioned my then-boyfriend who denied it through and through. You know that saying that people believe what they want to believe? Well, I believed what I wanted, and I lost no trust in him after he swore that nothing happened between him and this other girl. He even made me feel guilty by telling me I was unfairly accusatory. A few months later, a girlfriend of a friend of my then-boyfriend admitted to me that I  

I finally understood what women feel in abusive relationships and why they stay. It completely shattered my self esteem, self respect and sense of self worth.  I should've gotten therapy, but instead I went on to waste 10 years of my life with the same person (got three awesome kids out of it, so it's not all a total loss).   Let me back up.   My ex first cheated on me before we got engaged.  I was away for three months for work.  Turned out she was sleeping with her ex.  But I did  not find out until a few days before our wedding.  By that time this event was many months old.  I called off the

Now C was my best friend. He thought my wife was hot and I his. We had talked about swapping, played strip poker etc. Still my wife had had better offers. She had told me about some.

Have you ever had to harden your heart against your own child? For what reason and what was the outcome?
Yes — with my second son who was born with autism. He received the formal diagnosis of PDD-NOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorder — not otherwise specified) after the evaluation was completed a few months after turning two. Back then, the evaluation was not offered and was not made available until 24 months of age, even though I wanted it done at age one. He received in-home speech and occupational therapy until he turned 3. At age 3, he was admitted to an “autism” preschool class within the public school system. The program director and teacher were confident and encouraging. They allowed my so 

I did. It hurt so bad. I despised myself. My child was a habitual liar. Not just for the sake of lying, though. She would lie to get people to give her things. She would lie and cry to the neighbors because she wanted the candies and sodas they would give their own kids. We had some of those things around, but not all the time, and not for casual consumption. Sodas were for parties, and unrestricted until they were gone, but when they were gone, there were no more sodas until the next time we had a party. She was chameleon-like. She would emulate the kids she was spending time with, including mi 

This is a hard question for me. My husband died unexpectedly leaving me with our two sons who were 4 and 10 at the time. Suddenly I had total responsibility for everything. There was no life insurance to help. I had a full time job, a mortgage, a house and lots of bills. I tried my best to wear all the different hats and luckily I had a great support system from my family. My folks watched my boys for me while I worked and I was able to keep up with the majority of my responsibilities. My younger Son, Ryan began to act out in high school.

Yes, I definitely have. When my daughter was around 14, she started getting rebellious. Typical teenage stuff… ok, fine. But around 15, she escalated that behavior.

I gave her warnings which she did not heed. So one day, after we had a disagreement that ended in her hitting and kicking me, I contacted the Juvenile Court and filed assault charges, plus charges for the destruction of property. (Dur

I had already sent him out of province to get him away from the people he was hanging with and when he came back he got right back into the same crowd.

How does Hillary Clinton make you feel?
She makes me shudder. Her ego and her almost compulsive need to “change the world” and “impact things in a big way” pretty much single-handedly started the refugee crisis in Europe. When that little boy’s lifeless body washed ashore in Lampedusa, Italy? It was because of Hillary Clinton. It was because of her unbridled ambition and her inability and unwillingness to see the bigger picture and practice caution when caution was most needed.  You might think this is hyperbole, over-the-top, or untrue, but I stand by this 100% and here is why. Refugees have for a long time tried to get into the Euro 

A lot of ‘firsts’—the first openly gay Senator etc—are otherwise very bland centrists. This makes sense. If, for example, nominating any black person to be a Senator is controversial, you nominate the safest black person you can find. Hillary Clinton, the first woman to be the Presidential nominee of a major party, is otherwise a bland centrist. The things that are said about her have nothing really to do with Hillary Clinton. They’re statements about women who seek high office. For example, the answer to this question from Marian Hubbard, self-described Trump supporter: “The same way that seeing a

How I feel about Hillary Clinton isn’t relevant. What’s significant is that many Americans feel a level of hatred for her that borders on irrational.  Decades of targeted slander and libel have made her a monster in their minds. In 2016, I descended into the fever-swamps of that anti-Clinton propaganda and began fact-checking its hundreds of claims. What I found was a vast morass of lies, slurs, smears, and exaggerations spread out over three decades.

How do the people who voted for Biden feel now?
Great! No more stupid tweets solely for the purpose of childish venting, picking fights by punching down, firing people too stupid to realize who they were dealing with when they decided to work for that clown, and spreading lies.No more sucking up to Putin and that nut in North Korea to the point where your own national security team thinks you are a security risk, and being suckers for China by passing tariffs that end up biting us in the butt.No more lies from the press secretary, or fights with the press for no reason—the press briefings are actually normal.We have someone who is finally ta

I'm guessing they feel great, because they voted for change, and they're getting it. Gas where I live is up 60 cents a gallon. That's change you can believe in. You appreciate that change every time you fill up. The last president could negotiate stairways, Biden can’t. Change you can believe in. Biden has unaccompanied minors at the Mexican border back in the cages Trump got them out of. More change you can believe in. Watch him on TV (if you can); he doesn't know where he is, he thinks VP Harris is already President, and Nancy Pelosi prepared a committee of presidential disqualification for  

Thrilled. Part of that probably comes from the fact that, because of Biden's age and real emotional baggage that awaited him, once in office, that there was an expectation that he would do a poor job. That hasn't happened. Biden AND Harris have had arguably the best two months of any White House duo, ever. They have rolled out the COVID 19 vaccine very quickly, tens of mlllions of Americans have already gotten at least one dose.

So far so good. Right now the border is a huge problem, but it’s a problem that’s been brewing for years. It’s not an easy thing to deal with, but it’s a necessary thing to deal with.

It shows how important immigration reform is, we’ll see if Democrats are ready to face the problem which would have to include significant adjustments to the filibuster rules. Getting rid of the filibuster all together would frankly be fine by me. It’s use has become so abusive that The Senate as a bod 

I am sure that inside they are becoming more and more aware that their hatred for President Trump was certainly not a good enough reason to vote a dementia riddled lifelong horrible politician into the White House.

How do the people who voted for Biden feel now? Personally, I’m thrilled and delighted. Joe Biden is an even better President than I had hoped and expected he would be. I love having a person with compassion and empathy in the Oval Office again.

Original Question “How do the people who voted for Biden feel now?” About how I thought I would. I am pretty interested in politics, but since Biden has come to office, I spend less time thinking about it. I also don’t worry that the president is going to start a war over twitter or is going to do something that may jeopardize our entire survival. Whether you like Biden or not, the fact is that the trump administration was an aberration in not just American politics but politics in the world in general.

This is probably a pretty varied experience depending on the individual. There are for sure people who are elated. They voted for Biden, he won the election, took office, and is fulfilling the rolls and responsibilities of the presidency. This is what they wanted and they are jazzed about it. There are almost certainly also those who feel shorted. People who have very progressive agendas and they wanted to support a more progressive candidate but they were told to support Joe Biden because he would be their progressive and they did.

To be honest, I didn’t have very high hopes. I knew that Trump was bent on destroying our country and harming the world and that Biden wouldn’t be, so that was good enough for me. But I was wrong. Biden is absolutely focused on making the U.S. a better place. Not only fixing the harm caused by Trump, but actually taking a giant step forward fiscally, for jobs, for the environment, for infrastructure, for health, for racial equity, for alliances, and more.

How badly does cutting your hand feel? I see characters do this all the time in movies/shows.
Fun fact- fencing blades can hurt your hands. Anyone who has seen a fencing blade up close before is probably asking what the heck I’m talking about right now. For those who don’t watch Olympic fencing *cough* 90% of the population *cough* or have never had the pleasure of being stabbed or saber slapped (kinky shit fencing is), fencing blades are blunt. The tips of all blades are either flat (epee and foil) or rounded strips of metal (saber). Therefore, getting gored by a fencing blade is highly unlikely, unless the blade snaps.  On that point 😉, the sides of fencing blades are not honed. So if  

I ran my fingers into a vegetable mandoline:  It slices. it dices! - it cuts your fingers down to the f*cking bone. Image source: Stevens/co/nz For others, cutting vegetables is just a simple way of introducing tasty greens to a meal.

I was making a salad one night, slicing up the vegetables and I didn’t pay attention and ran 3 fingers pads into the razor blade part of the mandoline. That hurt. It stung badly.

It can hurt pretty freakin’ bad. There are tons of nerve endings in your hands and fingers. If you’ve ever had a paper cut on one of your fingertips, I’m sure you were amazed that such a tiny cut hurt so much. Over the years, I’ve had tons of cuts and burns to both of my hands and wrists. I’ve even had frostbite in both hands. My point is that I know a fair amount about hand pain. A couple of years ago, I had to have carpal tunnel surgery to repair some nerve damage to my right hand. A picture says a thousand words, so let’s start with one of those.  Here is my hand a couple of days post-op. They  

Because of my profession, I get minor hand injuries every now and then despite being very careful. You do something every day and eventually something slips. So let’s talk about this. In movies and TV it’s true that cutting the palm of the hand for . . . reasons is done quite frequently. This is because an actor can close their hand around the fake knife, grip it very firmly to look impressive and hide the blood bag, resulting in an impressive amount of fake blood being displayed when the palm is opened. In real life, this would be the stupidest thing imaginable. There would be a lot of pain, bu

This is my hand, I had an accident with a chisel, somebody spoke to me during my downstroke and I plunged a 5mm chisel down onto the back of my hand.

It was a gruesome injury, so deep you could see fat (sorry gross, I know, I didn't look, I didn't look 

Speaking from experience, it bloody hurts. When I was something like 9/10 years old I had decided, stupidly enough, to fight a 14 year old bully. He was an arse and needed sorting out, nobody could go outside safely, but I digress, back to the story. I had been knocked down and managed to slice my right hand open, the hand I use for most things like gaming, writing and even just eating and drinking most things. It took me about a month, give or take a week, to heal my hand to the point that I could remove the bandages and whatnot. However I still did not have full mobility. I struggled to write 

I’ve cut my hand twice, though neither were get-rushed-to-the-hospital-worthy accidents. They were major compared to slight paper cuts, though. The first incident was when I was using a cutter knife (is that the exact term?) to cut something.  Thankfully these blades don’t seem to be very sharp compared to kitchen knives or other cutting implements. It made for a pretty rough cutting, and it slipped, and went straight into my thumb, and cut out a large amount of skin. That was something like 13 years ago, so it’s completely healed over. The second incident was when I’d gotten my first Swiss Army Kn 

Cutting anything on your body isn’t a joke, let alone your hand. I sliced my hand pretty badly once while doing the dishes and now I can’t feel my index finger. as soon as it happened I had about a quarter inch piece of ceramic plate embedded right below my thumb. To put it bluntly, there was literally blood everywhere within 5 seconds. I might just have a weak stomach, but even writing this and remembering that moment give me chills. I’m very fortunate my brother was there and able to take me to the hospital. I also occasionally get really bad anxiety from doing the dishes because of how trauma 

It depends on the cut. Paper cut hurts like hell. Cutting vegetables and the knife slips, just deep enough to feel it. The other end of the spectrum, working in a photo lab for Loblaws.

The metal of the canister sliced the palm of my hand up good enough it was a bloody mess. The film top to bottom was coated in blood. I finally get caught up a half hour or so later as my manager comes in to check on me and talk to me about said order. I made a gesture with my hand 

I literally crashed my left hand in a bailer ( those big industrial hydraulic pressing machines ) so i think i might be qualified to answer this .

The commuter plane is a small twin-engine 14 seater plane. The flight would leave Trenton NJ, go to Lakehurst NJ and then to Pax River Md. People who had business at Pax would take this free flight for the day on occasion and typically return on the same flight that evening/afternoon. On this one particular day, one of the Engineers dropped his two well-liked kids off at 

I was volunteering in a YMCA summer camp when another classroom had a lot of drama from a little 5-year-old. He was wild, refused boundaries, and was very aggressive to other campers. I was quickly reassigned to work with him due to my background with working with behavioral and emotionally challenged children. He was quite the handful, but did respond to the one-on-one support. He turned out to be a little sweetie. I would walk him out to meet his mother at the end of the day, and I found out he was a foster child from a chaotically abusive home. He had 4 siblings close in age that were all p 

I was working in the ER at a local hospital, which is also a trauma center and an academic teaching hospital. Patients with significant diagnosis or injury are often sent to the hospital where I worked for advanced care. One night we got notification that a patient was being sent to us with significant burns to the face, hands and upper torso. The patient was a child, about 12 years old. My job was to try to get information about the patient prior to their arrival so that we could have proper services in place. The kid’s medical needs were made clear, but no one seemed to have any information  

I can’t speak in specifics because of confidentiality and social work ethics, but my saddest interactions with children are when I’m trying to help children and adolescents who have awful parents, but not to the point of meeting the legal definition of abuse or neglect and necessitating a report to CPS. As someone who has taken years of coursework on child development and working empathetically with all people, it breaks my heart to see parents who don’t acknowledge their children’s mental health systems, who control their children’s life with no respect for their desires, who don’t accept the

When I was growing up, my mother added on to the house to build a daycare. It was open from 6am-6pm. Her best friend was the main teacher and she hired other girls to watch them play and take naps in the afternoon. There was a little boy in our daycare who was probably about 3 years old. I remember one day, the afternoon girl could not come so my mother and I watched the kids. We took them to the bathroom and this little boy smelled so bad when my mother pulled down his pants and underwear to place him on the potty. She told me to come and help her and I thought I would be absolutely sick, but  

My parents were emergency caregivers for Child Protection Services and after my weekly Judo training with my sister we came home to 3 young pakeha girls who were supposed to stay with us overnight. Ages 5,3 and 1. Initially, this was exciting for me and my sisters because Mum could no longer have children. We soon found out that these girls had serious issues. My mum stuck the two older siblings in the double bed together and the youngest in a portacot. Later that night, my mum checked on the two older sisters to find the 5 year old touching her sister sexually and the baby had a panic attack whi 

I had a 9yr old student that was sleeping in the bushes at school, becuase mom and her boyfriend locked him out so they could spend the week at the Indian casino. He snuck in at 5am when the custodian came in, and went to the furthest Boys room and washed his clothes in the sink, and used the hand dryer to dry them till the doors opened, then he would pop out in the hall like nothing was wrong. This went on all week till someone figured it out, but he never got a hotline call, becuase there are not enough foster homes in the district and they would lose the enrollment if he was placed elsewher

Work out (exercise). If your main goal is to get ripped then definitely be more focused on strength-building / strength-training exercises, but also save some time for cardio if you’re willing to but don’t overdo it. If you’re a beginner when it comes to regular exercise, it might be wise to consider starting out with light work out training and then gradually building the weights up the more you get in a groove in your exercise routine. Don’t try to be some ultra-powerful bodybuilder right off the bat. It’s probably most important though to first start out by developing a solid workout routine t 

Life is 10 percent what happens to you and 90 percent how you respond to it.” -Charles Swindoll One day, everything seems great in your world—maybe not perfect, but overall things are going to plan. And then something happens.You lose your job, or someone you love, or your home, or maybe even your health.It isn’t fair. You don’t deserve it. You didn’t see it coming. You didn’t plan for it. You have so many feelings and frustrations you don’t know what to do first—or if you want to do anything at all.It would be easier to sit around feeling bad, looking for people to blame and complain to.

Bodyweight training  Bodyweight training is a strength training method that allows its practitioners to train and gain muscle without using any weight training equipment. The famous Lafay method as well as Street Workout, which is all the rage on social networks, are a logical and applied continuation of this training principle. The athletes do weight lifting exercises on street furniture (barriers, escalators, traffic signs), and even do competitions where the participants perform amazing figures… in the street, the subway or in the woods. Yes, bodyweight training is a great way to build muscle 

Lift heavy stuff until you can lift more heavier objects. Brisk walking / jogging/ regular cardiovascular training and treadmill is essential to burn those extra flats and create more muscle mass. Always prefer the stairs over a elevator. Use a bicycle or walk instead for grocery purchase or a random trip to the market. Just aim to surpass your own limits. The above things contribute to physical strength and prowess, if you want to sharpen your mental health and enhance it, try calming down, don't overthink, but think vividly about stuff that matter to you, set goals and objectives and plan a men 

As human beings we all want to get better at everything. You probably want more money, more success, etc. The good news is that increasing physical strength is actually pretty simple if you are willing to put the work in. Ok here goes, let’s get to it. Evaluation And Testing  First before you can make any progress, you have to know where you currently are. If you don’t know where you are you will not be able to figure out where you need to go.

10 Ways To Grow Stronger In 31 Days 1. Use Free Weights And Compound Movements: To be strong and huge, your workouts must rely on a Greek god's exercises: squat, bench press, deadlift, military press, rows, power cleans, and other variations of these movements. They recruit the largest amount of muscle mass.Free weights require you to stabilize the load and allow weights to be moved exactly as the body is designed to move them. Since the trainee is controlling every aspect of the movement, every aspect of it is being trained. 2. Learn Perfect Technique: This separates the men from the boys. The se 

Depends on which strengths are you talking about but i am guessing it to be physical and mental so here is my advice Physical Strength Exercise, now this can include running, weight lifting, playing physical games etc. In this pandemic most of the gym were closed, so alot of YouTube videos on home exercises are available, I always prefer home workout instead of going to gym (personal opinion). I feel daily 1 hour of physical exercise is important at start you might feel a bit lazy or maybe a lil tired but when your body gets used to it, it is the best thing.

Here is an answer from Weightlifting corner. One of the best kept secrets methods to build absolute raw strength, and power is a combination of many barbell movements and some assistant exercises, primarily employing the deadlift variations, the barbells squat variants, the overhead pressing and for strength and power development combined, the competition style and options of barbell snatches and clean and jerk movements. In the deadlift department, I would include the Sumo, the Conventional, the Romanian, the Jefferson deadlifts, I would also often pull dead weights from the rack, the deficit a 

Hi The following article explains how you can gain your strength:- Nobody said life was easy. Whoever told, lied. But it's not as difficult as we thought. You know, the right is shown in school, but it is up to you to make the wrong, this is something like that. Do you want to stand on your own feet despite everything?

What made you forbid someone from ever entering your home again?
What made you forbid someone from ever entering your home again? It was many years ago. I had a friend who I now realize was either borderline or narcissistic (to the level of a disorder). But back then, in the early 1980s, I just tried to cope with her weirdly manipulative behaviors. Finally, I had to put a boundary in place when she tried to rope me into coming along and sneaking into the home of a guy she’d been dating. She was planning to soak all of his valuable inherited silver pieces in an extremely strong salt solution to force him to have her over to help him clean and restore it—!? Thi 

I have a friend, I’ve mentioned her before as my promiscuous friend. I’m not judging anyone who decides to choose that path, but the way this girl has demonstrated herself was less than desirable in this household. The first big thing about her was in the summer between our 7th and 8th grade year, my family invited her along with us on a trip. She was very much grateful for this since she never left our home state much. We were preparing for this for months. The night before we left, she was texting a few guys back and forth and they were asking for nudes. Only reason she didn’t send any back w 

I am clean and sober over 42+ years. Despite an upper middle class background and the best of schools, I decided to forego pursuing advanced education and degrees and instead learned most of my knowledge, by trial and errors on the streets of New Orleans and New York City with a bottle in my hand and pills in my pocket. Many times it was society’s lowest of the low, the homeless bums, prostitutes, junkies, and, winos that were my teachers and mentors. They taught me survival tricks, street smarts, and how to stay clear of the 3rd rail. I loved those dear folks. When I hit a very low bottom and  

My eldest is nearly 19 and autistic. He's not very experienced at relationships. He brought his first girlfriend home at 17 and she seemed like a nice girl. She lived an hour away and he doesn't drive so I would pick her up and bring her to our house for the weekend. Everything seemed great. However I started to have misgivings about the relationship. There were lots of red flags. Including the fact that he told me when he stayed at hers because she liked to drink (perfectly legal in your own home at 16 in the UK) and he has always been anti drinking (even now he's never even sipped alcohol an 

-PROLOGUE- So many answers already and oh boy.. This question seems made for me. Technically I could say there is two or so times I banned someone from my house — one was a cleaning service —but I'll go with the one, the person, that was most emotionally draining. Warning: it is super long. It's unfortunate my last name is tied to this, I do hope there is not any backlash on my family or the community I live in. But I'm not about to go anonymous on this. I have no reason to. If anything it might make people more aware. Before I've written briefly about having a family member addicted to drugs. Th 

Let’s go back to 2009, when I was still in high school. I will repost a story I did on Reddit a while back. All names will be changed for the purpose of this answer. Before I begin, I just want to give you a short answer and say that I banned my ex friend from my household right after these events took place. She basically betrayed my trust and stole from me blatently. Also for the disgusting bullying she did afterwards. Anyway, this ex friend in high school was in foster care. We'll call her 'Bonnie.' Thing is, in the beginning when we started getting to know each other, 'Bonnie' was only just p 

My best friend I've known since I was 5. She's currently homeless, pregnant, has a one year old and 9 year old twins. Finding out she was recently made homeless, I decided to let her stay until she could get a job, find a place, etc. Lasted only 5 days, until my first night off (I work nights, so I usually sleep all day and pretty much just lock myself in my room) and about midnight I realize my cigarettes are missing. I lose stuff a lot, so I wasn't too worried but I wandered around the house looking for them. After the first 15 minutes of not finding them I started really digging because even 

It was a summer morning, some holiday (possibly July 4th?). My parents were over visiting, we had a reasonable number of beers and were discussing politics. The neighbor showed up (out of the black of night) and asked if he could join. No problem - we pour him one and ask him what he thinks of Erdogan (the Turkish president; it was right after he allowed a coup in his country, suppressed it within hours then put every bit of resistance down to school teachers in prison). The neighbor says something indistinct - not just ‘not into politics’ but also fairly drunk. Oookay, it’s a holiday, as long 

The only person who I have banned from my home is a friend of my partners (I am a 37F, and he is a 35M. The friend is a 28F). We live in a very small studio apartment (20 square m) and she has been to our place before. It s a long read, but TLDR at the end. We have been together for four years and in that time, she is the only person who I have not taken to from his friends and family. When I first met her, she was polite but seemed a little upset or sad about something, the second time, she didn’t contribute to the conversation and was a mute the whole evening. I noticed, that my partner only  

I genuinely liked my son’s best friend, Ben. For a seven-teen year old he was remarkably eager to please and warm hearted. I secretly hoped one of those qualities would rub off on my somewhat apathetic son. When I overheard Ben telling my son he was looking for a summer job I knew that I’d found my guy. I offered him $500 a week to clear out the brush and brambles in the overgrown pasture at the edge of our property. He agreed on the spot, smiling so wide during dinner that peas kept falling out of his mouth. Ben started a week later. He worked five hours a day, often in the hot sun, without com

Feminists calling every person who supports men’s rights a misogynist. “You misogynist, chauvinistic pig!” How many men must have heard this? It is a common sentence that gets thrown at men a lot of times whenever they try to discuss the issues they face. Apparently, the term isn’t just reserved for men. There is a rising trend on Quora where ANY person who speaks up in support of men’s rights or decides to disagree with feminism is called a misogynist. I only realized this trend when I voiced my support towards men’s issues. For all the butthurt feminists of Quora, here is the definition of misog 

The mindset of men towards women in the Islamic Arab countries. I am not to write anonymously about this. And although I am completely aware that this answer may result in many troubles for me, but here I am, an example of an Arab ex-Muslim twenty-year-old girl whose trying to clarify, to some extent, what is happening to women in this part of the world. To be fair, I must note that, of course, every rule has its own exceptions, but I am going to point out to what's common in where I live through what I've seen and heard from incidents and struggles of many Arab women.

A week ago, I went to a photo studio to have a headshot taken. It was a little crowded so I had to sit and wait for my turn. A teenage girl came in wearing the traditional shalvar kameez along with a hijab. She looked like she was around 14 and she came with her father who was wearing the traditional dress as well. I suppose they had a reservation because their turn came first. The photographer told the girl to settle down while he set his camera. The girl took off her hijab and let down her hair. She was combing her hair when her father came storming in and told her to cover her head. The girl 

The fact people are willing to become ignorant and cruel just to defend an ideology. I think, contrary to many opinions, most people are actually good. At least, they stick to their morals. I saw this story about a girl getting raped in Pakistan as a pre-accorded revenge, in which her own family agreed. The girl could have ran away, yet she stayed. Her family could have said no, but for some reason, they didn't. Most of the individuals involved probably share a mindset, a sick mindset, but that doesn't mean they don't have the capacity to love or to feel. Still, what they did was horrible and d 

I get annoyed over little things although I hide my emotions well… When I greet someone with 'salaam alikum' and they don't reply back the proper way. Yes it happens. I meet some Muslims here in the UK and they don't even reply back the right way (wa alaykum salaam) and even if they do they usually think it is funny. I get so frustrated and angry about this but I keep quiet. Stop being embarrassed. I say it because usually I feel down and saying it and hearing a reply makes me feel better.Fake friendliness. One of the things I hate the most. I'd rather be mistreated than have people pretending 

Women claiming they want equality. It frustrates me to no end.  Instead of going on yet another diatribe, I’ll give a short explanation as to why this is definitely not what women should be asking for: Women can get pregnant, and when they do, they need time off to focus on their labour, and also time to recover from the pregnancy. They (and the child) also need the support of a man at that time. In most countries, men are not recognized for that role and don’t get time off, or at max about 2 weeks off. You really want us to start treating women the way we treat men?Although possible, due to phys

I'm writing anonymous due to the fact my mother is a frequent reader of quora. Colorful language ahead. I am currently 17 years old and living one of the dullest lives possible of an average teenager my age. I'm by no means a trouble maker at home nor am I at school. I'm a junior in highschool and my grades are pretty average aside from algebra because… its math. You may be wondering well what frustrates you? Its the fact that I can't enjoy the teenage life. You know this consist of the small things like going to the movies or maybe going to the mall with your friends. Or maybe even walking to t 

One of the things that frustrates me is the constant assertion that children who aren't smacked are not disciplined. Proponents of corporal punishment are under the illusion that all those of us who choose not to hit our children instead let them run wild, unchecked. They couldn't be more wrong. Yes there are some parents who either through laziness or ignorance don't discipline their offspring. Some even make a conscious decision to not instill any discipline at all. Ever. The “n” word (no) is a no-no. They think the child must learn to negotiate life through their own trials and errors. No rul 

Hypocrites. I literally am sick of people having double standards. Let's have a look at this tweet for once  He shared something he liked. He didn't create this meme. Anyways I don't support him sharing this meme. This may in one way or the other hurt Aishwayra Rai's sentiments. After the tweet, Aishwarya didn't care to reply or report this tweet but how could we people tolerate this. So, the shamming started.

A police officer has been charged with her murder. Sarah wore bright clothing. She called her boyfriend. She wore sensible shoes. She walked under well-lit streets. Covered every inch of skin. She did everything right.  And it still didn’t save her. The level of victim blaming around Sarah Everard is disgusting.

What is the rudest/most unusual/most obnoxious thing you have seen someone do at a wedding?
In Israel, there was a pretty young bride with thick dark hair, a contagious laugh and a bubbly personality. We’ll call her Malka (a common Hebrew name, it means ‘queen’). Three months ago she became engaged to a handsome, earnest and smiling Yeshiva student who we’ll call Yonatan (Jonathan). They were introduced by Malka’s cousin who studied in Yeshiva (Jewish college of Torah study) together with Yonatan. They were friends - for years they used to hang out together, sometimes studying Torah and sometimes just chilling with some good Israeli music and some good Israeli beer. He knew well from  

I went to a destination wedding 12 years ago in the Caribbean as part of a short vacation trip that I took. I didn't know anyone but my traveling companion and her daughter; the rest of the wedding party were strangers to me. The bride looked beautiful, the weather was great, and everybody got along. It was actually one of the best weddings that I had ever attended and I was happy that I was allowed to be a part of it. After the ceremony at the wedding dinner, the bride announced that she was expecting and that brought applause and cheers from everyone except one person. What I didn't know (and  

Many years ago when I first started dating my husband his older brother was dating a girl that I just wanted to distance myself from. Now many people will understand when I say that his older brother is the first born, male, and the family was Italian and German, so he could do no wrong. He’s a great guy and I love him, but I sometimes get weary of his elevated status no matter what. Ok back to the chick; my husband’s father must have had a little crush on her too because by association she could do no wrong either even though she was pretentious, insulting and thought she was the smartest pers 

You will have to decide who was the rudest person at the wedding I am going to describe. A few years ago I worked with a young lady who was rather shy. She was one of these people that always wanted to please everyone, and got upset easy. I liked her a lot but felt like saying, calm down! Anyway I was invited to her wedding. I hadn’t been to that church, but I had heard that the Pastor liked to hear himself talk. I didn’t know what to make of that statement, but I sure found out! The service started out nice, it wasn’t a very big wedding, maybe 50 people. About half way through the service befor 

Going anonymous, so as not to embarrass a couple of the characters who are still living. My dad remarried in 2000, and he wanted to have a big, fancy reception for family and friends. It was held at a very nice location downtown. Drinks were readily available to those who might have wanted to imbibe, and at events like this of course there's always someone who does…. My dad had invited a neighbor-lady from across the street to come, but instead her 40-something son, whom we'll call “John”, and his date showed up. I recall him arriving with a big smile on his face. In no time, he was tossing down 

In the late 70s, I was invited to a what turned out to be a fairly fancy and expensive wedding reception. The lady (let’s call her J.) and I were early into our relationship, so I was aware that I wouldn’t know too many of the other guests. That would be a bit of a problem because J. was a member of the wedding party, and we would not be spending much of the evening together, not even at the same table for dinner. The Bride’s parents had really laid it on for their only daughter - the City’s finest Hotel Ballroom, tons of guests, excellent dinner, et cetera. All the guests were dressed up - the 

I was the maid of honor at my college friend's wedding. Everything went beautifully except for one moment during the reception. One of the first dances was supposed to be just for the wedding party; the groom with the bride, both sets of parents with each other, and all the attendants with their opposite-sex counterparts. While the dance was being announced, the best man - the groom's younger brother - slipped out and nobody could find him. He had ducked out of his own brother's reception just to avoid dancing one dance with me. I had only met him the day before, and we had barely exchanged a  

Didn’t (thank God) happen at any wedding I have been to, but I recall reading this one in the newspaper years ago when they published a collection of readers’ worst-thing-that-happened-at-my-wedding stories: Hands-down winner for me was one woman recounting her husband’s best man and (I guess) a close bud of the best man who was an usher as well. The two of them showed up to the ceremony already pretty drunk … it was all they could do to get these guys through it without too much disruption. Then came the pictures at some nearby park. Apparently they had brought along some flasks and renewed the 

Well, how about a string of things. I had major surgery 6 weeks before my daughters wedding. I spent my Six week recovery making the wedding and bridal party dresses and the last few days cooking for 200. My Dr. was pretty upset as I needed a second surgery. I had been in a roller coaster accident and he said that a sharp jar to my neck could sever my spinal cord. However, the wedding won. He gave me some heavy duty pain killers in case I needed them at the wedding. I had 6 oxycontin pills. I put them in my glove box just in case. I don’t take pain killers. I had a sister who was addicted to the 

I work as a wedding videographer so I’ve seen my fair share of obnoxious moments…but by far the most memorable one I’ve seen and heard was at a destination wedding I attended as a guest. The ceremony was perfect, the bride looked radiant—everything went without a hitch. During toasts, when it came to the bride’s older sister’s turn, she had a bunch of people roll up a projector screen in the middle of the ballroom. She started kicking up a fuss about why it was taking so long to set the whole thing up because the event planners were having a hard time connecting her laptop and project a powerpo 

What is the sneakiest thing you did to get back at an awful neighbor? Did you get caught?
Alright, darn it. Another check-mark on my “Hell Application”. I expect this will earn some deserved Quora-hate. Here we go. Years ago I camped with a girlfriend on Hermit Island, Maine. Beautiful place; well preserved nature on a rugged coastal island. Well spaced camp sites among the stunted coastal forest, quiet, water teeming with sea life. Family run and family friendly. Splendid, charming place. You drive there across a tidal flat as long as the tide isn’t high. We loved it so much, we kept extending our stay for new nights. Well, Hermit Island is popular and booked well in advance. This mea 

“What is the sneakiest thing you did to get back at an awful neighbor? Did you get caught?” It was when I was in university and the awful neighbours were the guys on the floor above ours in residence. The guys on the third floor had been a problem for the whole first semester, frequently coming down randomly to the second floor with buckets and throwing water all over the second floor, getting our beds, clothes and of course books and notes wet, then running upstairs and locking their door to us before we could react. This had happened every few weeks for months and we were getting sick of it. Bu 

This happened back in 1992- when I was 9-years-old and about to go to the fourth grade. I remember it being the last week of my summer vacation- as school would be starting the following Wednesday. That even was on the day my parents took me to meet my new teachers- as I would be having a man (for the first time ever) for math, science and social studies. The other teacher was an old woman I would have for language arts- spelling, reading and English. I heard she died just a few years ago after it happened. This family who had two sons that were "real troublemakers" lived just down the street f 

Not my proudest moment…. But in my 20’s: There were five or six guys, foreign Univ. students, living below me in a condo complex. They took all the parking including mine with new Porches, Lambos, etc. These cars would last maybe two weeks. First you’d see a dent, then a bigger dent, then the car would disappear and be replaced by another new one in a different color. I didn’t really care, but they hung out on the stairs every day and would not let me pass to get to and from my vehicle. They’d pinch my arms and grab at me, saying stuff I can only assume wasn’t nice. The landlord didn’t care, he  

I purchased a house in Hot Springs, AR in 2010. When my wife and I went to look at the house a man from the house next door came over to chat. He said that he’d seen us on his security camera and, since he knew the house that we were at was vacant, he just wanted to make sure that everything was okay. We explained that we were meeting the realtor to look at the house and he began telling us about the area. The realtor pulled up as we were talking and the guy returned to his house. The realtor didn’t seem to like the guy but we didn’t think anything of it even though it wound up being a red fla 

I have to admit there are two occasions. First one was after I moved to a new town in the UK and was living in a decent enough suburb of a large town in West Sussex. At the time I owned a VW Passat estate (station wagon) it was a pewter or metallic grey color. Very nice car. One morning I come out to find it had been scratched from one end to the other, in some places down to the metal, I was livid. A neighbor saw me examining the damage and told me it was done by the two kids who lived at the end of the close, their mother couldn’t bear anyone having a better car than them, they owned a ten yea 

I’m not a vengeful person so I’ve never done anything to retaliate against even my worst neighbor (who was a drug dealer, wife beater, &amp; attempted murderer), but I did get some sense of schadenfreude from karmic retribution. He had a major heart attack &amp; they had to cut him wide open leaving a huge scar. He also developed Parkinson’s and has been too unwell to come around and steal from me anymore. I also made sure the police knew his correct address (he kept fraudulently listing mine so they would come around harassing me &amp; trying to intimidate me thinking he was hiding in my house). I also go 

What is the sneakiest thing you did to get back at an awful neighbor? Did you get caught? Two stories. Neither of which involved me, and both of which may be considered only peripherally connected to the question. But here goes anyway: A company (that I will not name) occupied one or more sections in a long, continuous building made up of a large number of identical sections. They had a meeting room on the first floor (second floor for Americans), immediately below the roof void/loft. A planning meeting was taking place when the site engineer/maintenance man came into the room and whispered to the 

When I was young I had a lawnmowing business that required me to have equipment and fuel ready to go in a trailer parked around to the side of our house. As gas prices started to skyrocket during the 1970’s energy crisis, several times I got to my job sites, unloaded my equipment and prepared to fuel them with the gasoline in my cans only to find… nothing: they’d been emptied while on my trailer. After several frustrating repeats of this, I mentioned it to my father who had been a B-17 mechanic and flight engineer during WWII. He mulled it over, grinned slightly and said, “I’ll handle it.” He m 

A story about my dad. When I was 10, we lived in a house with a backyard that was separated from the neighbour’s yard by a four foot high wire mesh fence. All our bedroom windows faced the backyard. Our neighbour (I’ll call him Dick because that’s what he was and that was his real name - so perfect) had a large circular stone pond in his yard, built above ground with a diameter of about 10 feet and about four feet high or so. It was filled with aquatic plants and bullfrogs. Oh, Dick loved his bullfrogs. “They make such sweet music,” he said. No one else agreed - our bedroom windows all faced the  

What is the best case of “You just picked a fight with the wrong person” that you've witnessed?
What is the most unforgettable experience you had while grocery shopping?
Terrible, while shopping at a large grocery store in Seattle, Washington my wife leaned over into the meat counter to pick up a package of hamburger meat and was electrocuted. I wasn't with her but received an emergency call from the police of what happened and she was being transported by ambulance to Seattle Univerdity Hospital. Right here I'd like everyone to know and even follow this because I've always believed in it fully. I'm my wallet and her purse and inside the shoes of my children was and is always a list of emergency phone numbers with the most important and fastest to be able to r

First: I was one of seven children. Six girls and one boy. Mom and dad got brave one weekend and took all of us with them grocery shopping and if we were all good in the store, we would go for ice cream after! Well we were all on our best behavior in the store and while all seven of us were ordering our ice cream, dad and mom decided to stop into the bar that was next door for a cold one of their own. When we were all finished with our ice cream, we met them in the bar and told them we were finished. Well, they had just ordered another shell (a glass they used for beer on tap) and ordered a sm 

Wow. I gotta go back in time for that one. I was probally 5, my moma took me shopping with her at the First Kroger store in Cincinnati. We were very poor, my dad a seasonal worker. I had never seen a supermarket before this was 1956, when mom wasnt looking I took a candy bar, and put it in my pocket. We went through the checkout and got to the door. When moma grabbed me by the collar and told me to give her the candy bar and made me take it to the cashier and tell her I was sorry that I stole the candy bar and give it back. I was humiliated as my moma said we are poor but we are not dishonest.  

This is an unforgettable story for my Dad, who often talked about the time when he went to the grocery store with me and as a baby sitting in the kiddie seat in the grocery cart. This was more than 50 years ago—before shopping cart seats became more kid friendly, and shopping carts were probably made a bit differently. Both of my parents were young. My Dad was 21. While I was sitting in the cart, he did a “wheelie” with the shopping cart and at that moment, the metal in the shopping cart handle, dug in deeply into his hands. My father say it hurt like hell, but he couldn’t let go of the cart be 

I live in a US city where everything is rather homogeneous. Go to any big name box store and you will see what I mean. Yes every thing is clean, well stocked, arranged logically for a good customer experience and fast checkouts. Most US consumers have never shopped in a farmer's market ,or seen how or where their food is grown how its harvested. At some point they should ask themselves those questions and perhaps visit a market once in a while. I have been to some REAL MARKETS in Mexico, Brazil, the Caribbean, Asia. They are Open Air Markets where you must go early in the morning, buy the fresh 

actually i have two that spring to mind: one good and one bad the bad one was standing in front of the meat counter and a very small elderly woman that repeatedly slammed her cart into the back of my legs and demanded that i move so she could pick her meat out. finally i got mad and told her the next time her cart hit my legs i was going to push it back a hell of a lot harder and she would be thrown to the floor(i dont like doing things like that)the meat manager had been watching and told her that if she continued to behave that way she would be banned from the store. so i was in the right but 

2 years ago, I went to Walmart, you know, to go grocery shopping. My son had to go to the bathroom, so I walked him over to the mens bathroom and got him into a stall. I didnt want grown men to see my 3 year old take a piss. So I waited for him while in the stall with him, then all of a sudden I hear loud footsteps, and yelling coming from outside the bathroom, I get nervous because I have my son with me. “Alright buddy are you almost done?”, he said yes, then all of a sudden the two men, came in yelling and screaming and chasing each other, I know get extremely nervous and grab my son and hold 

1979, I went shopping at a grocery store with my grandmother, somehow we got separated, and I found her in line, as I got in line I tried to talk to her, she kept turning her head away from me. By now I'm upset, I'm crying cause I don't want to be dejected, and or so angry, she made matters worse. I remember the boy bagging the groceries, he saw my face, and I could tell this was breaking his heart, he offered me a sucker, they kept them in a drawer where the cashier was, I barely motioned no, still visibly upset, and feeling pain in my heart. He got real quiet, and just smiled at me, as tears we 

What is the most unforgettable experience you had while grocery shopping? I was shopping at my local No Frills grocery store and my blood sugar dropped. I didn’t realize that is what it was at first - but I started to have cold sweats and felt funny. I saw a stock person on a three step ladder down the aisle - I went and asked if I could please sit on the top step as I was feeling very shaky. He stepped down and asked if I was having a high or low sugar experience. I said it is low as I didn’t eat much today. He went and grabbed a single serving apple juice from the shelf and gave it to me. I t 

I took my youngest child with me grocery shopping because I made sure that the rest of my three other children did not need to baby sit him, because he could be a handful. I took the grocery cart and went down aisles picking the items on my list. My son was dressed in a snow suit and winter booths for it was the heart of winter in Quebec. He was following me and my cart until he decided that it was him shopping and not I. Therefore, he started finding whatever suited his fancy this morning. As he stuffed items on the cart, I eliminated them. He was running back to re putting the items. First h 

What is the stingiest thing that you have seen a family member do?
I have a few here: My late ex in-laws had always struggled with money, although they both worked unbelievably hard. My father in law had suffered with polio as a young man and lived with terrible pain all of his life. He always worked through it all until they retired. Just being left with the UK state pension, life got even harder for them. My ex husband bought them an old caravan, which they lovingly did up and it became their pride and joy. Their first holiday with it was only about 20 miles away from their home, but they were really excited to be getting away even though they had no spendin 

My father lived with me for 5 years rent free. Never even mentioned money after his then wife turned 62 cashed in on his social security, and left his ass. She won’t divorce him. Anyways we had a small liquor store. The liquor store was doing ok but not great, Obama took office, my construction career tanked and the liquor store kept us going till it didn’t in 2011. We had a baby in 2011 and we sold the store, we didn’t lose any money but we didn’t have a way to turn that money over, anyhow I started selling the pills I received from my doctor to help with the bills. Eventually that was a bust 

I have a cousin that is notoriously cheap that it has become a running joke in our family. Once she came to to stay with my family for two weeks where we cooked, took her out for meals, drove her to locations she wanted to see and catered to her. She knew I wanted a wine rack as I had been shopping for one with her a few days prior. I worked this day and came home and she had bought me one. How thoughtful! I was unsure though if it was a gift or not so I asked her what I owed her. She told me $80!! Okay, more than I wanted to spend for something I didn’t pick out but I paid her because luckily  

My husband’s aunt not telling the rest of my husband’s family that my husband’s father’s parents (my husbands grandparents) had passed away, so she could gather all of the money before anyone else knew they had passed and started the legal processes.EDIT: I wanted to add another that I think is just as bad since I’m not sure how to make a 2nd separate comment on a post yet (if that’s possible at all lol) So here’s the 2nd stingiest thing I’ve seen someone do: 2. Another woman, a friend of my grandmother, (in her 50s if that matters) is/was so bad off on drugs and was living with her very elderl 

Early in my marriage, my husband told me that he’d be set for life because his parents were very well off (when his father dies, he’ll inherit close to a million dollars, as will his brother and sister). He’s a CPA who does his dad’s taxes and handles financial matters for him, and I’ve seen some of the paperwork, so I know that this is true. Both of his parents were Depression-era babies, as were mine. The big difference between the two sets of parents is that my parents decided early on that they would rather help out my brother and me while they were still alive so that they could see the di 

My mother always behaved like she was entitled to the best of everything, and thought the bare minimum was good enough as far as other people. She insisted on holding her husband’s paycheck as well as her own, deciding how the money would be used before he even had access to it. She’d say she was depositing both paychecks into the bank account, but actually she cashed them and spent the money as she pleased, then hid some in her purse for later, depositing whatever was left (if anything) when she was finished. I know that because she often took me with her. Bills often didn’t get paid, and when  

My ex-husband’s grandmother was a millionaire but she was the cheapest person I’ve ever met. As an example, one year, we went to her house for Christmas and were exchanging gifts. At the time, I was supporting my whole family because my ex was a deadbeat and we were just making ends meet. Despite this, I bought grandma nice gifts (around $100 for them), mainly because she was getting up there in age and I wanted to make sure she had a nice holiday. When it came time to give me a gift, she went into a back room and emerged with an unwrapped shoebox. When I opened it, there was a used extension

I’m from a family with 8 children with a tradition of getting together monthly at each other’s homes to share a meal and socialize. Once we all had significant others it was normal to have about 16 adults plus children attending. The person hosting would provide the place, the dinnerware and beverages and everyone would bring a dish to share. It was always a feast with most of us bringing at least one if not more items. My oldest sister, although she was always one to parade her success making sure we knew she was well traveled, had important friends and luxury items, was always the cheapest. H 

After my mother had back surgery, she had to walk 2 miles a day. Of course, she lives in the country and the weather doesn't always behave in Oklahoma. My aunt Kathy, her sister in law, had a treadmill that she hadn't used, but for a catch all, in so long, the dust was thick, and there were cobwebs. My uncle Jimmy, mother's little brother, knew she needed a treadmill and was going to sell it to mother, at a MUCH discounted price than if mother had to get a new one. Uncle Jimmy knew aunt Kathy hadn't used it in years, and thought she would be glad to be rid of it, get it out of the way. Oh no,  

Will you ever do a face reveal?
Will I ever do a face reveal ? Let’s see the consequences If I do face reveal on Quora. Tremendous boost in my followersI am extremely hot guy. So many girls will stalk me on Quora &amp; on other platforms also. For many girls it will be difficult to take their eyes off from my hot profile picture. They’ll keep staring at my profile picture. My answer will also get enormous upvotes. My questions will also get so many followers. Some people will start passing comments like “Because you have attractive profile picture, your posts are getting better response from the viewers”. So, I don’t wish that any  

Wow! It’s the question that everyone searches because they want to face reveal! Or, at least that’s what I did. Anyways, here’s the face reveal! *intense music plays in the background* . From this:  . . . . . To this:  . . . . . Then to this:  To The Final Face Reveal . . . . . . . . . . . . Bum Bum Bum (Please be warned I have very long hair don’t make fun of me) . . . . . . . . . . . Hi  This is an Akashi. Now, you may be thinking, “Is that a girl or a guy?” The Akashi is a guy. Now, if your thinking, “Man this guy is pretty ugly” You’re right. And if you’re thinking, “Why the heck does this guy have his glasses on top of his head?” The answer is becau 

Not much, actually. My first profile picture on Quora was my own face and I kept it for a week. Then (I'm not kidding, this was my actual thought process), I thought to myself that if I ever became popular, I wanted to be associated with a profile picture that wasn't my own face. So I took a picture of my headphones and used that because Quora was glitching and messing up the pictures I pulled from google images. It looked a little something like this.  Not exactly photogenic. Later, I figured that the glitch was fixed so now, I use this as my profile picture.  As for the chances of me revealing my  

I’m really, really self conscious. Because of this, I’m scared of doing a face reveal. I’m worried that people are going to dislike how I look. I’m worried that people refrain from reading my writing because of how I look. And so much more. But in the end, yes, I am going to do a face reveal. And I have several reasons for this. For one, I want to stop feel feeling like I’m hiding something. Enough people have been asking me this question recently that I feel like I’m withholding information. It’s an odd feeling. And I’d like it to go away. Another thing is that I want to put a face to my writing,  

Very, very low, but not impossible. I get tempted a lot to reveal my face, to show what I mean sometimes. For example, I recently answered a question on my experience wearing glasses. It would have been much easier for me to just show what I meant by showing a contrasting shot with and without my glasses. I would not have needed to write as in depth as I did to describe. I refused though. I refuse because my privacy is really important to me. I’m not popular on Quora (which doesn’t bother me as much as it should), but I have revealed many very personal stories about myself. I have bared my soul  

I can’t speak for the far future (one year+) but as of now, no. I feel like my answer to all these types of questions is just “I’m a 17 year old girl!” said with varying degrees of severity, but that is the truth. I used to have face reveals up on Quora, but I stood at less than 500 followers when I did. No one cared- I got no messages, no comments, literally zero attention for it. And I was foolish enough to think that was the norm. Around early May, I wrote an answer to “What did you wear to prom?” with various photos of me in my prom dress, my shoes and my corsage. It blew up overnight, and wa 

If you have read any of my really, really old answers, you’d have noticed that I said that I would do a face reveal at 1k followers. And, well, um… I guess the simplest answer is not right now. Let me set the scene. I’m only fifteen, a female, already targeted by a lot of people on this website, as well as a surprising amount of pre-teen girls (and enbies) who want to call me “Daddy Chao” (yeah, I don’t even know), as well as currently under the responsibility of my parents… Who don’t want me to be on this website, as it is considered social media, and I’m not allowed to have that stuff yet. I’m par 

Yes I will. Witness my TRUE….. GLORIOUS….. MAJESTIC FACE!  Ta-da. Okay, jokes aside its not really a great looking face. I am okay revealing my face on Quora. I totally understand why not many people would like to do a face reveal because they feel uncomfortable and thats totally fine. There are a lot of crazy people on the Internet. Especially for females its totally understandable you dont want to show your face since we have crazy psychos in the real world. I am totally okay with showing my face because I honestly dont have anything to hide. I’m just a 5 feet 6 Vietnamese male who lives at home  

As of now or in the near future? Probably not. Sorry guys, you’re missing out. JOKES JOKES On a side note, i do have a few serious reasons why I’m probably not going to do a face reveal. Whoopi Goldberg here we go: Security reasonsNot gonna lie, but I’ve heard many many stories about underage girls getting strange, perverted messages after doing face reveals. Dick pics, all that shit. That’s just messed up and something unnecessary I don’t need. It’s not about anything else, but purely security reasons and for my own sanity. PurposeAs cliche and stuffed up this sounds, I’m here to write. As a rela 

The answer is…no!  No, not even this time. I did it before and then every creep on the Internet said they wanted to see my body without my clothes on and so I had to cooperate and do it and that led my (loving but sometimes abusive) mother to track what I’m doing and then I got my phone taken away after that. Then, she kept getting on me about it since 2017 (yes, it happened in March 2017) and I told her to stop accusing me of it when I did it one time and never done it again but she kept saying that I must’ve been doing for years and I said that I haven’t and she said that I have been doing for 

What made you upset today?
Do you ever feel disgusted by how superficial people are?
I have this friend, Fauzia, and she is definitely smashing the 10 on the hotness scale.  That hair is awesome, and she will always and forever be my favorite baby girl. We were colleagues in Malaysia Airlines and now colleagues with AirAsia. I loathed her while I was with Malaysia Airlines. Heard through the grapevines she was a ‘special’ one. Head always in the clouds, refusing to listen to what people said about her. One time, she flew with a friend of mine (we are her juniors in Malaysia Airlines) and she drilled some bitchiness into my friend’s head… just because. Her exact words were “So you th 

Hooo, boy! You've hit a personal hot button. Absolutely! It's one of the main reasons I eliminate people from my list of potential friends. I'm interested in people who want to talk about new ideas, interests, and issues, and have something to teach me. The fastest way to make my eyes glaze over (and water) is to talk about things like clothes, hair, cars, or sports. I have a very old friend who is the same shallow princess today at age 58 as she was 30 years ago. There's been no growth or expansion in that time - except for her new religious fervor which adds new social opportunities to her l 

All the time. But especially when people impose their beauty standards on a child. In Egypt, the white/ European look is idealized just like in many other places. And I have no issue with an adult woman doing what she wants with her body, no matter how silly I think it is. However… 1-Whitening the child's skin tone, attempting to do it, or obsessing over it is damaging.  This is just a crime. Don't make your child feel flawed because of something he's born with and try to “fix" him. Thankfully, the number of the not-so-bright parents around me in this regard isn't very big. But the few I've seen wer 

In my teens and early 20’s, absolutely I did. There was a time when I read philosophy almost daily, contemplated our purpose as a species, and compared the products of great minds like Socrates, Shakespeare, Kant, Hegel, and Nietzche with the dreadfully mundane reality of people going about their lives. For years, it seemed like everyone was stupidly materialistic and a slave to their low passions, never ever using their rational mind or consciously creating purpose and meaning in the right place. The only exceptions were the minds behind great works of literature, and certain people around me  

Yeah totally! I mean why do they have to make it so easy to judge them? Its really disgusting how easy they make it for all the non-superficial people to point out their superficialness. I mean why can't they just have deep conversations about their personal experiences and thoughts with non-superficial people they probably don't know that well? The non-superficial are entitled to deep, personal conversations right? And why can't those superficial people order the drinks I want them to order? Pumpkin spice latte? So basic and superficial! Same with listening to all the latest music and watching  

No, I’m never disgusted by it because you never know someone for who they really are. For example, I know many on Facebook and know their true life. The life I see online, the life of happy, or so caring about their world, or so perfect, is mostly just a way for them to find meaning in world they are in. Some are going through tough times. Some are hurting. Some I know who look gorgeous, and so beautiful, I mean truly sexy on outside but I know they are facing many challenges in their life. Once, there was this girl and we were in a cafe and she was saying all kinds of shit about this one guy, B 

It makes me sad that people can be very superficial. I had bullied by my peers since the age of 7 till 16. I was a chubby kid and I got bullied so harshly. When I have become 16, I couldn’t bare it anymore. I had a crush on a boy at school but I was feeling so insecure and at first he acted like he was interested in me but then I got that he was just being a teenage boy, acting all dumb. I was very heartbroken and I didn’t want to feel ugly anymore. I went on an extreme diet and walked for 3 hours everyday. In 3 months, I lost 15 kgs. Everyone at school was shocked how much skinny I got and ho 

6 years ago my boyfriend told me my boobs were too big. Aka, “you’re fat” I learned that he told a former girlfriend. “Yea, I’m with an older woman who makes a lot of money but she’s gotten fat and I don’t find her attractive anymore.” In college I was 130 lbs and my boyfriend told me I should lose 10 lbs. Almost every man I’ve been with has had negative things to say about my appearance. I recently got romantically involved with a former co-worker who I’ve known for 26 years. Two years ago, I went on a personal journey to get fit and lost 70 lbs. I love the way I look and I feel fantastic. I’m 51  

Yes, so much. I hate how superficiality can be almost like a mold to people and they will do the same things and listen to the same music and have the same hair. I hate how superficiality can make people try and be something they are not. I get disgusted when people get sad because their photo did not get more the 150 likes on Instagram. I get disgusted when people know each other for 3 days and then they start dating and posting pictures saying “they are the love of my life”. I hate superficial friendships, that are just based on dishonesty and trying to make the other person like you. But, especia 

No. I got past that in high school. I was an overweight studious kid who lost friend after friend because I did not aspire to be like “Cher” on “Clueless.” At my 10 year high school reunion, A popular girl and I reconnected because we both brought our siblings as dates. Another popular girl saw her talking to me and pulled her away from me mid sentence. I was flattered! I shed all the baby weight in college and started understanding what sexuality is late in life. I was at my peak around 27 and nobody recognized me. How dare I look attractive now after being so frumpy and intellectual looking in

What is one of the most subtly sad sights that you have witnessed?
What made you feel disgusted today?
I often criticized feminism but I never advocated to hate feminism . I also defended feminism in few of my answers , a lot of feminists here assures me that the women I complain about are not feminists but misandrist . From then on I started to like feminists in here . But after what I read today , i was really heartbroken and disgusted . It may be old but I came to know this now. It shows how much sexism against men is denied and how much sexism by women is tolerated and excused  This is Jessica Valteni , as you can see in the picture above she wore a shirt that says “ I bathe in male tears “ .

T.W.: Disgusting content ahead. (Please. I am not joking. Read further at your own risk.) Let me start with some cleanliness. I am working these days on something that requires my attention to Instagram the most. As usual, I started tapping on random stories (because of boredom) but I do closely look at the things shared by some people. They post something valuable everytime. Or if not, they don't post useless stuff either. There is an lgbt+ youtuber whose posts I always read or check because they’re always meaningful and worth sharing. Yesterday, she posted a story about an anti-feminist and que

She is allowed to believe in what she believes in, and we can all voice our opinions. The person who posted this video (who slams what she does) also added in the comments section, We did it, guys!

What made me feel disgusted today, is an answer to this same question here on Quora.  A girl answered anonymously about online harrassment, that she has faced the day before she answered. I'm attaching the screenshots of that answer:     After reading this answer I just felt bad about, how most of the girls these days face online harassment regurarly. But online harassment isn't what disgusted me today! This answer did! Want to know why? . Okay so I slid into the comments and I was speechless!

She was derisively named the “Hottentot Venus” by Europeans as her body would be publicly examined and exposed inhumanly throughout the duration of her young life. Moreover. her experience reinforced the already existing and extremely negative sexual fascina 

Few minutes ago I was scrolling Instagram and I came across a very known page (won't take name). At first when I saw the post it instantly bring a huge smile on my face. That picture was of a toddler. And who doesn't like seeing a cute chubby face. At first I thought a parent might have sent this picture to this page. But laten on when I saw the tag list I came to know that an a/c has been created by a parent for showcasing her kids pictures. What a big deal? Right? Well let me show you what the big deal is! Well seeing this literally boiled my blood! How could a parent use their toddler as a s 

Nowadays , alll of our generation are running for sex due to which all are addicted to porn. But not only teens or adult , kids of 5–6 years old have too started seeing Porn. So here's the story.

So when I was playing with them, my brother came( cousin of same age of my) and shouted me not to play with them , they have deteriorated a lot .

What happened to you as a child that feels like a punch to the gut every time you think about it?
Who do you feel sorry for, and why do you feel sorry for them?
Arthur Meighen - Wikipedia  Who? Okay, he’s a Canadian politician. Let’s start there. He was born the same year as Sir Winston Churchill, so they’re the same age. They also had similar stratospheric careers. By World War I, they were both 40 year old political superstars. They were both members of each country’s Conservative parties. But there the similarities end and their paths take distinctively mirrored paths. Churchill crashed and burned in World War I. He held a high government post and then came Gallipoli, for which he was rightfully sacked. He joined the army and served in the trenches as a  

Mia Khalifa  Yes we all know this woman. Mia Khalifa is a former Lebanese-American pornstar. A video of hers, which she wore an islamic headscarf in, sparked outrage in the Middle East, and she even attracted the attention of one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations ever known, ISIS. Mia Khalifa received many death threats from ISIS and those from her home country, claiming that she has bought shame to her home country Lebanon and insulted Islam. While I understand that what she did was extremely provocative, I don’t think she deserved death threats over it. One women can’t really bring s 

Me. In 2005 met my girlfriend in London, was offered a job in Europe and she persuaded me she wanted to go. In 2008 I found out she had been raped by a successful businessman son who owned a top London restaurant, the reason she wanted to leave London. Came back to the UK to find her counselling, put in a police report to the Sapphire branch, which I had to proof read and I promise you it is something you don’t want to do, and start looking for a job, my Mother offered to put us up for a couple of months. What transpired is that no one bothered to tell me my Mother is clinically insane, in 2011 

Have you ever heard of Bobby Dunbar? ’Cause that's who I feel sorry for.  Cute, right? What if I told you that the boy in the picture might not really be Bobby? His story is considered to be one of the most mind-puzzling mysteries to occur. It is a long one, so I will summarize it while keeping all the major information and detail. So basically, back in 1912, young Bobby Dunbar, who was only four at the time, went on an ordinary but fun fishing trip with his family and cousins to Swayze Lake, Louisiana. On the day, his father, to whom Bobby was greatly attached, dropped them at the location and hu 

When I was in kindergarten, I had a crush on a classmate named Ali. Ali was a cute, studious and well-mannered kid but was unfortunately too uptight. He was the type of kid that was always serious and no matter how eventful our days were, he always managed to look neat throughout the day. I on the other hand, was a complete mess. My mother had shaved my head and it was beginning to grow out into a little afro. My afro was the subject of all types of jokes by my elder brother and male cousins. It always looked like I was growing out a mushroom on my head. To make matters worse, I had sinusitis wh 

 The woman in the picture is 21yr old katherine Bennet. She reported to the authorities that she was kidnapped and raped by her co-worker. The authorities then arrested the co-worker a day before Thanksgiving.  The man in the picture is Dustin Toth, an army National guardsman. He was the perpetrator of that horrible crime and of course you know the military would immediately abandon such a man. He deserves it right? An expert revealed that Dustin would have been facing 30years to life for this accusation until it was finally revealed that katherine and Dustin had consensual sex, after which, Kathe 

This man.  His name is Daniel Saffron. Around 8–9 years ago, Daniel’s grandfather passed away and left him and his father each an inheritance of $250,000. With that money, he could’ve had for himself a stable life. Pay for his future children’s college tuition, buy a house, a car, invest, put it in a trust fund, reserve for medical debts he may bump into in the broken American healthcare system, etc. Instead, his father Alan Saffron,  who unfortunately had control of the funds, transferred all of Daniel’s inheritance into his own account and used it to open his restaurant, Burger Kitchen. The worst pa 

This guy.  He’s Peter Nielsen. Pretty happy looking dude, eh? He was only 36 when he was murdered. He was stabbed in the stomach and heart several times. That too, right in front of his home, with his wife and little children present. Now, what exactly had happened, you ask? Nielsen was an air traffic controller for Skyguide in Zurich. On the fateful night of the 2002 Überlingen mid-air collision accident[1], where two aeroplanes collided into each other mid-air, Nielsen was the only air traffic controller handling the airspace, two workstations at the same time. It was past midnight, he was stressed ou 

Whom do I feel bad for?  I feel badly for the precious rhinos who are butchered for their horn, while the rest of them is left to rot as their horn is shipped overseas and sold as cancer-curing medicine despite being comprised of almost nothing more than the keratin protein in our own hair and finger nails. (Rhinoceros | Rhino Horn Use: Fact vs. Fiction | Nature | PBS)  I feel badly for the intelligent elephants who are slaughtered for their ivory tusks, whose herds mourn the loss of a member, and hold burial services for the dead, all for the sake of ivory knick-knacks and medicinal practices tha 

Levi Ackerman  Levi Ackerman of Attack on Titan is easily one of the most complex characters in the series. Levi is the son of Kuchel Ackerman, a prostitute who worked in the Underground and was made pregnant by one of her clients. One day, Kenny Ackerman, Kuchel's older brother, came to the city to see her only to find that she was dead. There, he found a young and squalid Levi sitting in front of his mother's bed. Kenny then took Levi in and trained him. Later on in his twenties, Levi became part of a band of thieves alongside his partner Farlan Church, who would use maneuver gear to commit var 

What happened at a wedding that made you feel horrible for the bride?
Nearly 90% of the 500 invited guests didn't attend the wedding. This wedding was recent, just last Christmas. The bride and groom, let's call them Michelle and Paul, were married on December 24, of all dates. Michelle is a goddaughter of my aunt and her mom has been friends with my aunt since high school. Paul is a third generation Filipino Chinese but his grandmother is very traditional. She insisted on consulting a feng shui expert, who claimed that December 24 was the best date for the couple to get married on. How he decided on this advice, I have no idea. In Filipino culture, Christmas is th 

I felt bad for both the bride and groom. I was living in the Czech Republic. My girlfriend and I were coming back from a small road trip and had stopped at a rest area sort of thing. In Czech even the rest areas have pubs but this one wasn’t a nice one, it was really boring looking. I notice three people at a nearby table. A woman in a wedding dress and two guys in suits. One of the guys looks nervous and the the woman in the wedding dress looks miserable and had obviously been crying a bit. Every once in a while she would say something to the guys. Neither of us could hear them but it looked li 

This happened 12 years back. It was the wedding of my cousin sister. She is such a sweet person, so kind-hearted that everyone simply adores her. After the wedding, when it was time to bid farewell to her, we could not stop our tears… she was the apple of our eyes and to see her going away was heart-breaking. We were happy that she was starting a new phase in her life, but at the same time, we knew that life would no longer be the same. My cousin sister also started crying. It was a drastic change for her, and to step into a new life without her family was a little frightening for her. She had  

My cousin was engaged to be married and the planning of the wedding was in full swing. Mind you, the relationship had always been long distance as her husband was based in Asia. As Igbos, it isn’t unusual for couples to live apart or far away from each other whether married or dating but I hate it regardless. My cousin wasn’t different. I’ve always had a bad feeling about her partner as he always sounded obnoxious and up to no good when on the phone but I like to mind my business except advise when I see someone doing something bad or being played.  To be honest, I felt he was a narcissist as he a 

Picture it: March 13, 1993, Central NJ: One of my best friends, Cynthia, was finally marrying her boyfriend of nine years. The ceremony was at a gorgeous chapel at Rutgers University (interestingly, the same one I would get married in the following year; same minister and everything). Unfortunately, that was the day of the biggest blizzard since 1979 (which we referred to as “The Great Snow of 1979,” because we had no imagination). It began snowing at 1:00am and kept right on going throughout the afternoon. More than 30 inches accumulated and over 300 people died, for crying out loud. A few of us 

Her dress was ruined. This beautiful dress made of the finest silk and satin and lace, jewel encrusted, was ruined. Let me paint the picture: it's the Croatian summer up in the mountains and the heat is unbearable. Being late July, it's basically lethal to go outside as reports were coming in of people fainting from just having windows open. My cousin is set to have her wedding in a week, on August 1st, and everyone is praying that the weather will ease down, as the majority of the wedding was taking place outside. Everyone was studying the weather channels and websites, noting down any changes. 

It was 2015 and I was in the final phase of immigrating to the United States. A close friend of mine had met a pudgy young man with a distinct resemblance to George Costanza at a night club somewhere. She was 25 and as a Ukrainian girl (albeit living in Canada) was in a panic about being unmarried. She was gorgeous, absolutely stunning and still is. Fast forward about a month and she finds out she’s pregnant. Big oops. Oh well the two of them decide to get married. She can’t just get married however, it has to be lavish. So she sells her car and and somehow between both families they manage to  

I attended a wedding a few years back, the place was not too shabby, had a good atmosphere and pretty dangling lights. I’d say it was an upscale, posh joint. The venue consisted mostly of an old family park, newly renovated and delicately set. It was about an hour’s drive out of the city, quite far in my opinion. The touch-up was quite beautiful, though. Colored lights were placed across the tree lines, as a big white canvas covered the blue morning skies, birds kept chirping, and the river beside it complemented the scenery. It reminded me of one of those qliché wedding scenes on TV. It was absolu 

When I was 3, my brother and I moved with my grandparents to Virginia. In the meantime, my mother got together with this man who had a single daughter. When I was 6, I moved back to Florida with my brother to be with our mother. I met this little girl. Strangely, we were born in the same hospitals, on the same exact day only hours apart. She was my twin from another mother. We all lived together for about 2 yrs. Finally, my mother told us they were getting married. We were happy. We got along like siblings. I remember all the work my great-grandma and grandma put into her wedding. It was beaut 

A few years ago, I was the pianist for a wedding. It was a beautifully decorated church with white calla lilies everywhere, bunches of baby’s breath and smiling, happy people walking in. I was signalled by the organizer to advance to the front of the church to play the prelude. People were still walking in but after a few moments they settled down and waited. Normally I don't play preludes that last for hours, usually it's just for a few minutes while waiting for the crowd to settle and for the organizer or planner to signal me that the wedding party is ready to walk in. But, today, something was 

What does having a mom feel like?
I have always heard and seen how having a mother is such a wonderful blessing. Some of the answers here are a proof of that. However, not everyone is as lucky, even if they have a mother. I was tortured and abused by my mother all through my life until I managed to leave home for higher studies. When my father married my mother, his family’s financial situation was very bad. He had to travel far from home to get a good job to sustain his family, and he took mother along so she could work as well. When I was born, as both were working, it was decided that I would stay with my grandma (dad’s mom). 

My mother lived to the age of 93. there are many things I remember about her. She had a chemical engineering degree from the famed ZhongSun university way back in the heat of WWII. All her adult life was in moving from place to place, and all having to do with one war or the other. We finally settled down in a village in southern Taiwan, where we were the only mainlander family in the farming village. With six kids to feed, she, like my father, learned to ride a bike so she could commute to take on a teaching job in the local vocational school. Not able to speak the Taiwanese dialect, she depen 

For me, having a mom felt like home. No matter where we were, as long as she was around, I was home. She was my teacher, my best friend, and my biggest cheerleader. To make her proud was the best feeling, and conversely disappointing her was worse than any other punishment. Which led to her becoming my Jiminy Cricket. When something feels wrong, it is her voice I hear telling me that. She missed her calling as a Private Investigator. One day I was out with new friends that I was meeting and hanging out with that night to play games. I was living alone, I had my own cell phone account, my own in 

Depends on the mom. My mother has peter pan syndrom so she was always afraid of growing old. Now she’s old :p. She lost her hearing partially in her youth going to too many rock concerts. She is the oldest of 6 sisters so she’s very bossy and opinionated and critical. I mean she tried to be loving as she could but she really sucked at choosing lovers. She could have been married but she has serious control issues so she fucked that up. Besides that she had my brother with an abusive drunk. She had me with an asshole drunk. And one of her other long time boyfriends was a lying drunk. :p Needles 

When I was 4, my mom and dad got into a silly fight because I was being adamant about buying grapes and my dad did not let me. From something that insignificant, the fight escalated to a point where my dad and his brother set up ropes to hang my mother and I. Regular domestic violence sprouting from the tiniest things my mom said/did was common in the household. But this was too much even for someone accustomed to that environment. Mom ended up locking us up inside a room and placed a phone call to the police station. Just as my father had broken down the door, the police arrived and we left f 

When I was young, having a mom was the best. She always played make-believe with me and my brother, and she played all the parts we didn’t want to. On any given day, she’d be the Sheriff of Nottingham, Captain Hook, Lord Voldemort, and any other manner of nasty villains, all so my brother and I could defeat her as the heroes. She made cookies with us and we ‘helped’ by taste-testing the ingredients. We giggled as we swiped the raw cookie dough, and she swatted our hands away, scolding us about the dangers of salmonella. When she wasn’t looking, we stole more. She made school fun. Baby Bro and I  

I’ll tell you a little bit about it. I was born when my parents were teenagers. My dad worked long shifts, and did whatever he could to support his family. My mom stayed home and watched me, and later on my brother. Later on, we fell on some hard times and she had to start working too. She worked hard to support us. I never realized it, but she would’ve done anything to keep a roof over our heads. Sometimes I feel terrible about how ungrateful I was as a teenager at times. When I joined the Army, we had a small going away party for me before I shipped off to basic training. Everyone was having a  

I probably couldn’t tell what does having a mom feel like a year ago when I actually had her in my life. But now, I can tell what I miss. I lived with my mom throughout my childhood and through a major part of my youth also. Around two years ago, I got married and settled down at a place far away from my native country. My mom and I talked almost daily. She had been ill for a long time. However when I left, her health deteriorated further. My husband and I visited her and stayed with her for a few days. She was happy but too ill to even show it. All I remember is her crying face as she laid on b 

It really depends. Different people have different experiences. And not all of them are good. For some, it can feel like comfort, safety, and a reassurance that someone is there for you. It can feel like there is a hand holding onto yours whenever you need, and another gently pushing you along at the same time. It can feel like the closest person you know saying “I love you” in the softest voice. A blanket of warmth and gentleness that will always be wrapped around you. This is The True Mother. For others, it is like a battle cry. A primal yell that ignites the fires of determination inside you. 

I don't know what it feels like but I can tell you how I am as a mom. We were at the school my daughter and I. She is telling me about all the stuff she did that day before I arrived to volunteer in her class. As we enter her class this like jerk comes over and says “Hey retard” then shoves my daughter hard into a wall…just reflex I leg swept his butt. Legs fly out from under him as I steady my daughter on her feet. No one is the wiser. It looks like I am just crouched on the ground talking to my daughter. I grab the kid by the shirt and lift him to his feet. I get real close to him and say “T 

How lonely are you?
Crushingly. I haven’t spoken to another person my age in a little over 4 years now. I’ve been outside a total of 12 (yes, I keep count) times this year, with the majority being important things such as hospitals or financial. I have one friend (two if you count his younger sibling), although I haven't seen him in over a year and a half, and we’ve drifted apart - he simply has different tasks that occupy his time. I can go weeks without even speaking a single word. I can’t look another person in the eye for more than a few seconds, often letting my eyes wander to their general area or to the side 

Badly lonely....I am going to use this question to vent out... My story is a bit complicated, well I grew up as an orphan child, my father passed away before my birth, and he was actually killed due to his job and some political issues in my country that time. I was the first and the only child. My mother got married later and the man she married to doesn't like me at all, he used to throw my books when I was young, treat me badly. At each time I felt he loved to control me, sometimes he talks with me and tries to be nice whenever I make great achievements thanks to my excellence at school, and  

I am so terrifyingly lonely. I am a married 25 year old woman. As a child, I was invisible. No one cared about what I had to say, what I was thinking or even what I was doing. My proudest moments went unrecognised and unappreciated, which slowly turned me into someone who was never good enough. Who will never be good enough, no matter what I do. My life was dedicated to pleasing others, constantly trying to attain recognition, to be seen, heard.. collecting the rare scraps of approval thrown my way. This was my coping strategy and I lived like that for a long time. Then, I gave birth to my child 

I AM EXTREMELY LONELY in my marriage. And I don't know whether this is because of cultural differences. I am married to a person from another culture. I am Asian and my husband is European. We were vacationing in my home country. I was pregnant while we were on vacation. He was supposed to leave earlier than me back to Sweden. So when we went to the doctor in my home country and found out that the fetus' heartbeat stopped and I was going to miscarry anytime soon, I felt so sad and depressed. He was about to leave the next day. I wanted him to change his ticket and stay longer with me as I needed 

Ok, I’ll say this one from experience, create a timeline to sort out some facts: Back in 1999 when I was 16 I had a family of 1 sister and 2 parents, along with siblings I’d see every 2 weeks, a group of 5 friends from school and a group of 4 more friends from a hobby. Also most stuff I had were either taken by an adult or envied by a friend 2004 I have a group of 10 people for my hobby/beta test job, a sister and 2 parents, I don’t attend family reunions anymore. I have a group of great peopleworking to build something unusual, while working on my english and executive skills 2009 In the middle  

I am male of 28 years old and I live in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia working in a MNC as software developer.I stay alone in a 2BHK flat because I dont like the company of people and I find solitude in staying alone.I usually work from 11am-8pm, 5 days a week.I smoke everyday and dont drink, only sometimes when I am in some office party. Everyday I talk to my mom once a day for 15-30 mins.Other than that I dont have anyone to talk to. I have/had friends but everyone is busy in life because of marriage or girlfriends.Everyday I check my WhatsApp to see if someone messaged me but no one does except 

I tried to prevent myself from caring and writing an answer for this question as I am not a regular user of Quora but I guess even after getting used to loneliness and isolation after years of experience, amazingly I still have some desires left deep within me which make me want to share my story with other people. Damn you human brain, you're so hard to figure out! Okay, so a severe case of loneliness here. And let me start by saying how glad it makes me feel to see the 100+ answers to this question and I think may be at least 10% of these people will be able to relate with the extent of my re 

I was curling on the couch across my therapist. My body language was the language of a broken man. The silence was deafening. Her gaze was piercing me. Her expression displayed a mixture of sympathy and determination. An expression rarely followed by good news. An expression every high-quality therapist, willing to face his client with unpleasant truth, should be able to make. “Vjeko, how often do you feel lonely?”, she asked. “Who, me? Never! I am always surrounded by people!”, I answered. “Just because you are not alone doesn’t mean you can’t be lonely! ”  During my early years, I was socially inep 

I am very lonely and angry. I get very sad when I sit down and think deeply about how my life has gone in the opposite direction than I wanted it to. Let me start by introducing myself. I am a 25 year old guy from India who recently started college in Mumbai and having a hard time getting adjusted to the city’s flow and culture. I have been a victim of depression, social anxiety and inferiority complex since the last few years. I am shy, introverted and have problems approaching and talking to people of my age (I am pretty confident when interacted with people with a specific purpose like work 

I am 29 years old female, working and living alone. Growing up i had pretty casual and peaceful childhood. While I love my family and don't hold any grudges against them, it's only now that I'm starting to realize how different I am to them. I am a person who just loves to chat, laugh, discuss different topics, show affection, spend time with people (especially the family and the ones important to me), support each other in difficult situations and celebrate the good ones. I adore waking up in the morning, knowing I'll be sharing it with someone positive and start the day smiling, sharing the b 

Have you ever had a Quora crush?
Yes I have a major crush on a Quoran, though he is not much popular here. I would have written this answer without being anonymous, but uff he hates these type of answers and he would have reported it instead of replying. Okay so lets see who he is: He is 17 years old and he also has a blog.He lives in a stubborn illusion.He has such an unique name, so much so that many people report his account for fake name, ugh.His name means ‘Curious’.I don’t know why actually does he mentions himself as lunatic, I don’t think he is.He doesn’t follow back or reply to messages generally. (Sorry but I don’t mea

I have a few stories that developed in the mind share about one of them. I won't point at it specifically. I also use "she" and "he" to make this a little easier on the eyes but at least one, maybe more, of the stories below are same-sex stories. Case #1: She reads his answers and she is blown away. He is funny, outgoing, and he has something to say about most anything. When she clicks on his profile she discovers he's in the same state as her, only a 45 minute drive away. She messages him for coffee and coffee happens. Smart guy, smart gal. More driving, more meeting, then a weekend at his pla 

Of course I have. I've had several. Some were age appropriate. Some were not. Some I've actively pursued. Some I haven't. My most recent Quora crush who I decided to pursue turned out to be a bust. She and I are not compatible… leastwise she's not willing to change for the likes of me so. But that's fairly typical of teenage girls now isn't it? This one woman on here who sort of found me to be attractive has stopped speaking to me even though I think she and I would have gotten along excellently. However she got drunk one night and a tad bitchy as most drunk people tend to get and she said I only wa 

Oh yes. The first time I came across her answer, I remember scrolling past it because I assumed her to be one of the models from those stock photos. And then I saw her again, and again, and again. Soon, I found myself binge reading her answers; and I don’t throw this word around easily, but I was floored. There was this clarity in the stuff she wrote. Stalked her Insta once, and then got busy with my life. But couple of days later, out of the blue, she liked a picture of mine on Insta. I sent her a text and we started talking. There are some people you could easily connect with, right? Well… she wa 

 Literally so perfect- Tessa Peterson (Heads Up: We’re not dating, I just still like her (if that’s a problem go suck toes) Okay, I’ve had a crush on this girl since 2020. Remember when she would take those mental health breaks for a week to two weeks, ngl I cried so much because I missed that girl so bad. But off-topic. You’re probably wondering, “why her”. Well, I’ll tell you why. She’s that girl you see once and never forget about.She is literally the baddest bitch you’ll ever meet (literally even I'm scared of her)She listens to Ariana Grande, Gracie Abrams, Lana Del Rey, and DOJA CAT FAN (etc)H

Currently and forever… I just met him a two weeks ago and he’s really nice and fun. I love his personality and I especially love how he listens and cares for everyone he knows. When I first met him, I was so scared of what he was going to say because the first thing he texted me was, “is that BTS on your profile?”. I got so scared because I thought he was going to say that he didn’t like them and I would’ve gotten offended but luckily he said he liked them and he was new to them so I was like, “Ok great.” He became a family member to me like a few of my old friends and not a lot of my friends be 

This boy. Vivek Tripathy. I have a crush on him.  I dont have any other picture of him. Few months ago, I was searching for some study methods answer and I came across his answer. I liked it but then I forgot about him. I did use his advices and tips and it worked for me. Not totally, but it did. After few days, his answer again popped in my quora feed. It was on manhood. I literally loved that answer. His way of thinking is so similar to mine, I realised it. Earlier he had an instagram account, I used to stalk his id there but he deleted his posts and disabled his id one day. I don't have any scr 

Major crush! I would, in all probability, blush and close my eyes if I saw him ever! I wouldn’t be surprised if I swoon at first sight. Picture Ginny Weasley meets Harry Potter in her awkward phase. This man has everything crush-worthy. He’s got class, he’s super fit, he is old world charm in his formal suit and did I mention he’s super powerful? He is without doubt, the most handsome man on Quora. Forget Quora, he’s one of the most desirable man to walk on this planet. Most importantly, he has a great sense of humour. He’s liberal minded and is in a great leadership position. In fact, he might b 

Yes, I have had a HUGE HUGE crush on a Quoran like never had before in my 27 years but can't express this to her. Although she does not have many followers and also not a frequent writer here still, I can't restrict myself falling on her. It's not only her philosophical write-ups on quora and prettiness that catch my attention. She writes fantastic poems and articles on her blog. She is a very well dancer though I have seen only one of them. She is a beautiful singer too, and I listen to her several songs. She is also a cool counselor. I have taken consultancy from her. The best part I liked is  

Yes I had a Quora crush. One is male and other is female ! A small background about myself: I am 20 year old girl who is very very shy to talk to boys and when I saw this person I immediately fell for him,I was an avid reader of all of his writings and I am a huge fan for him. Actually I thought of not to be an anonymous but due to the reason how he would react I am writing this way. Coming to him ! He is an NITian.He is 21.He loves his Father a lot.He started his own business at 19.And his quora bio is damn impressive. One more thing is he is a perfect extrovert with entrepreneur mindset and love s

Is there a way to make a pwBPD remember all of the good and happy times in a relationship with somebody that they've devalued? If so, is there any chance or hope in getting them back?
Why is it so hard for one to move on and get over a narcissistic relationship than a regular one?
What's it like to have your spouse cheat on you?
It's like driving your car and having someone cut you off, which runs you off the road; your car flips multiple times before coming to a stop. As you come out of a traumatic trance, you only to begin to take inventory of the real damage in the aftermath of the wreckage.  My wife had been cold for months. We were in our fourth year of marriage, but each successive year seemed to be an unraveling of our love into something that I could no longer recognize.  While we were dating, my ex was the BEST girlfriend I ever had. She saw me through an estrangement from my brother, my mother, the loss of a j 

Shorter answer: It feels catastrophic for a while, but the feeling subsides over time. It can indeed make you stronger. Longer answer: I figured out that my wife was cheating on me through a variety of avenues. Ultimately, it depended on me coming out of a state of denial and facing the shock. The first concrete evidence was a stash of letters. There was a cast of names that I didn't fully recognise at first, but I came to see that they were regulars on an online bulletin board site we both liked. The letters had a combination of breathless excitement over her new online BFFs, disdain fo 

12 hours in.... Feels like a bucket of acid in the stomach, and then some (despite taking all kinds of antacids). Can't sleep. Don't know how I'll get through the week, or even tomorrow, or even tonight. It was with a close friend, and now I feel like there's nobody in the world I can trust, or tell, or that can comfort me. She says absolutely nobody else knows, but how do I know that when I see any mutual friends that they really don't know, as opposed to them knowing and choosing not to tell me? She says none of her friends know, but I feel like everybody she knows or that he knows might have  

It's like someone takes your world, everything you knew to be true, and completely tears it asunder. You panic, you're scared, you can't believe it, your whole existence seems surreal in the worst possible way. Even if your marriage was troubled, like mine was, you don't expect it.  For two years, my husband and I had been struggling to (or so I thought) repair our marriage. We had young children, we were both making big life transitions - him to an extremely demanding job, me to a role as a stay at home mother. We'd lost some of our connection - I'd been responsible for 99% of the care of our c 

I actually feel the experience is different depending on the circumstances (as I’ve been cheated on online with dating accounts and such, and in “real life” twice as well.) The first time I was cheated on, I encountered it by accident - my long-term boyfriend had left his Gmail open on my computer after using it when he was sick, and I stumbled onto notifications for active sexting apps. There was a whole story he fed me about how his friend set him up as a joke, even got the friend to text me, and similar, but not long after I discovered unshakeable evidence. To sum up that chunk: I feel like a 

I was completely blindsided despite that everything was staring me right in the face.  I still have yet to recover and believe I'll face long term trust issues as a result. We'd been together seven years, discussed finally making babies but decided to put it off a couple months as a job transfer to another city looked like it'd be on the horizon. She started not joining me for gatherings with coworkers and friends, which in itself wasn't all that unusual periodically but she basically stopped coming out entirely. Then she started going out for dinner/drinks with friends and coworkers.  When she w 

Like my whole world crashed down on me. I was physically sick and couldn't eat. Lost 10 lbs in a few weeks. I was angry and jealous. I was hurt, I felt inadequate, and completely alone. Just devasted. We'd been married for 5 yrs, together for 7. We had 2 little boys together. We never really got along all that great. We had our good times though, and I honestly loved him and felt like I put 100% in our relationship and marriage. He had his anger and drinking issues. I just tried and tried to help him. Told him many a time that he needed to stop drinking and try to communicate more with me. He w 

In my situation I did not find out until many months after the cheating occurred. Initially, I had allegations from friends that, yes, it was true, I had been cheated on! I basically questioned my then-boyfriend who denied it through and through. You know that saying that people believe what they want to believe? Well, I believed what I wanted, and I lost no trust in him after he swore that nothing happened between him and this other girl. He even made me feel guilty by telling me I was unfairly accusatory. A few months later, a girlfriend of a friend of my then-boyfriend admitted to me that I  

I finally understood what women feel in abusive relationships and why they stay. It completely shattered my self esteem, self respect and sense of self worth.  I should've gotten therapy, but instead I went on to waste 10 years of my life with the same person (got three awesome kids out of it, so it's not all a total loss).   Let me back up.   My ex first cheated on me before we got engaged.  I was away for three months for work.  Turned out she was sleeping with her ex.  But I did  not find out until a few days before our wedding.  By that time this event was many months old.  I called off the  

The first time the Devil made me do it. Since then it has been my choice. We had not been getting along. I had had medical problems and we were in counseling  and we came home from one of these and were arguing and she blurted out 'I had an affair with C'. I'm like 'no shit, really, C?    Now C was my best friend. He thought my wife was hot and I his. We had talked about swapping, played strip poker etc. Still my wife had had better offers. She had told me about some.    I didn't feel threatened or repulsed, mostly surprised because she was the last person I thought would ever cheat. It wasn 

When dating, especially online dating, how do I bring up that I'm a loser? I want to be honest but I don't want women to be turned off by the fact that I don't have a lot going for me.
If a narcissist is easy to leave a relationship, what does that mean?
Do Korean women like black men? Is it hard to date one?
How do narcissists choose who's going to be their spouse, best friend, lover, etc.?
What would you think if a friend (with whom there was never even a kiss) invited you to dine with her, reiterating several times that if it was late you could sleep with her?
Since I foster open communication among my social circle, including making safe spaces for people to say what they feel and to accept and give rejection gracefully, I would think that my friend is saying exactly what she means. Friends can have meals together. I frequently dine with my friends, even one on one (well, I did before the world ended, anyway). Friends can also crash at each other’s houses, especially if it’s late and there are long drives ahead. All my friends have a standing offer to crash at my place if they come all the way out to where I live and it gets too late to drive home, a 

Well I think maybe she's saying IF ITS TOO LATE YOU CAN SLEEP AT HER PLACE not necessarily with her UNLESS SHE VERBALY SAID “sleep with me in my bed “ So I'd think since your “friends “ who've never shared a kiss together I'd think right away (unless she clearly said “sleep with her in her bed “ I'd think she simply means To SLEEP IN HER HOUSE but necessarly with her in her bed .UNLESS SHE STATED IT IN A CLEAR AND CONSISE MANNER .Your default idea should be UNLESS SHE WAS CLEAR ABOUT WHERE YOUR SLEEPING IN HER HOUSE .the default would be since your friends Is that yes you'll sleep in her home  

I can see how that might be a bit confusing. I would say what she meant, but didn’t say clearly, is that if it gets late you can just stay over night there at her place. That’s it, sleep, nothing more. Think of it as, woman lingo. The moment I read what you wrote she said to you I thought of the many times my female friends have said the same to me. It’s a figure of speech not a sexual come on if that’s what you’re wondering. I’m 99.9&amp;1/2% sure that I am correct in my interpretation. HOWEVER, there’s always that possibility that I could be wrong. If I am wrong and it gets late &amp; you decide to sta 

If there are no romantical feelings towards each other, I would think that she just wanted company for dinner and it f I was to sleep with her, then nothing sexual would be taking place ( because that IS possible) and also by her saying repetitively about sleeping with her, I would think she had too much to drink. However, sounds like she has been thinking about you as more than a friend for some time. She mentioned you sleeping with her lots of times because she was trying to read your thoughts on sleeping with her. If you weren't such a gentleman, you prolly could have slept with her that nig 

Sleep with her or sleep over? How long have you known this friend? Has she ever flirted with you or do you get the feeling she's into you more than just a friend? Is she attracted to men? If she said “sleep with me" than that's pretty direct. There's nothing to read into because literally that means sleep with me. If she said sleep over then I could see why you maybe reading into her words. The friends I have invite me &amp; my husband out to their place and typically if it's late they let me know that if we wanted/needed to we could spend the night. (Unless they already specified otherwise that I c 

I’d think that sounds nice. I like my friends, and a dinner and a sleepover sounds lovely, I’d almost certainly accept unless the proposed time crashed with something else on my calendar. There’s some chance that the friend in question has an interest in adding a romantic and/or sexual component to our relationship, how likely this is would depend on what our interactions are like in general though, and not just on this one invitation. (Whether or not I’d want that, would depend on how I feel about the friend in question.) Generally there’s open and honest communication between me and my friends 

Not crash — but sleep over? I think she’s far More than hinting that she like-likes you. Here’s a litmus test: Pretend you have a serious GF. Would your GF be OK with any of this? No? Why? Yah, becomes quite clear, doesn’t it? :) She’s asking for you to sleep in the same bed with her — she invited you over to eat at her place 1-on-1. She obviously at least wants you to want her. If you’re attracted to her — make a move. It’s quite obvious. She’s putting the writing on wall quite clearly. Which means even if she’s kinda screwball in the head and just wants you to want her and if/when verified she’ 

Maybe she's conveying something sneakily, but as a male, please don't take first step without getting a straight answer. Especially in such affairs which requires getting close. If she likes you, wants to go wild with you, let her say it straight forward. If you like her, express it in a friendly, decent and in a safe way possible. Let her pick up the hint, take you to bed and take it to next level. If she doesn't initiate, then just enjoy the dinner, thank her for hosting and go back to your home like a Good kid 😁 11 views · Answer requested by Michael RighiWilliam Deemer, Counsel men &amp; women on relationships for a decadeAnswered March 23, 2021 · Author has 57 answers and 25.1K answer views

Like many of the other posters, there’s a lot of gray area here that would need to be elaborated on to give the best answer. From what I can glean, you are just good friends and she wanted to have dinner with you and politely offered you a place to stay in case things got too late or you had too much to drink. Very few women I know, and I mean I don’t think I’ve ever met one, repeatedly tell me that if it gets a little late they’re going to “sleep with me” meaning have sex with me. Trust me most men would drag the evening out as long as possible. I’m pretty sure she was just referring to letti

I gave some home made jam to a co-worker who had given me fruit. He shared it in the breakroom. My supervisor went to each worker and asked what jam they wanted me to make, and insists I make jam for each person. How can I get out of this?
I would ABSOLUTELY make the jam. I would NOT involve HR. Here is what I would do. Start an email conversation with your supervisor and all your coworkers with something like “Jim/Judy has asked me to make jam for everyone on the team. I think this is a great idea and I am happy to make your favorite jam for you.” Explain that they each need to choose a fruit, and how much they need to provide to make jam for both yourself and them. Have them bring the fruit by Friday. Explain that there is a lot of preparation, but some of them will be getting their jam as early as Monday. Be super excited. Mak 

I have two personal stories to share, but let’s start with your boss. First, take a few slow breaths to quiet the righteous anger I would certainly feel in your place. Request a meeting with your boss and explain to them a couple of things. The other person did not get free jam as a co-worker. He got it to reciprocate a favour. He had given you his surplus of fruit, that he grew outside of work, and you made (let’s say) 6 jars of jam out of it. You gave him one as a thank-you. You still have 5 jars for your personal use. And you did it voluntarily, it was not an expectation.Compared to this, yo 

Bizarre. That’s just bizarre. I can’t even fathom the idiocy of a supervisor who did this. Clearly, they’re trying to make some sort of point about treating everyone in the office equally, but it’s just about the dumbest thing I can think of. Of course co-workers sometimes share food with just their friends in the office! And something you made on your own time is not subject to regulation by your boss. The first step here is to respond to your boss. Now, I could see two ways of going about this. The first is to simply assume your boss isn’t being the asshole that he is, and instead assume that  

First you need to analyze the situation, why did the supervisor do this? Either they have it out for you or your delicious jam was the talk of the office. Your supervisor took the focus off you and put it on to them. You are the scapegoat in a classic narc move. Your supervisor is the good guy for taking the time to find out what type of jam each person wants. You will be spun as the bad guy who wouldn't do it, you big meany. If you say something, they will likely accuse you of blowing it out of proportion. It's a lose, lose situation. People like these always have an agenda and they always min 

Huh? So, a coworker gave you some fruit. As a polite and kind gesture, you gave them jam you made from the fruit ( which is basically good manners). The co worker, being nice, shared their jam with your coworkers and your boss somehow feels that not only are they entitled to jam, but so isn't every coworker, though they didn't even have the decency to even provide the fruit! As a Boss, never in a million years, would it ever occur to me to even request one of my employees to make jam or anything else for the matter for my other employees. BTW- technically if you are told to make something for wo 

Original question: I gave some home made jam to a coworker who had given me fruit. He shared it in the breakroom. My supervisor went to each worker and asked what jam they wanted me to make, and insists I make jam for each person. How can I get out of this? First of all Anna, I believe you already realise that your supervisor is completely out of order here and cannot make any demands on your time outside of your normal working hours in this way. Secondly, as others have suggested, do not make any jam for your coworkers. Now I doubt that your coworkers will ask you why you haven’t performed this  

If you don’t want to do it, simply don’t. But if you are not completely against jam making as a company paid service and instead of your regular work duties, this could also be an opportunity for you: Make sure the boss knows how time consuming it is and ask how you should account for time, overtime and any associates material costs including supplies and shopping. It must be plainly evident that your time and expenses will be covered by the company if you do this for the company. Document all this and everything below in email. Prepare a short list of demands or “materials” needed and Company budg

Here's what you do. You look through your supplies, and if you have any extra jam that you wouldn't mind passing on, you come back and tell them… “here is the jam I have. If you would like some I can sell it to you for X price. But my job is this one.. not jam making. And I don't just make jams to order.” As for your supervisor, there is a second option if you don't mind making the jam, and just mind the wierdness.. I would gather together a list of supplies with the retail cost of each item neatly organized. Make it the mid-range to maximum price for each item, and overestimate how much of each 

First, tell the supervisor “NO". If he insist; If you have someone in your change of command above him you get a long with, “unofficially” tell them the situation and see what they say. Tell them you do not want them to step in just yet.Ask from company email, for a P.O. or whatever your company uses to purchase supplies, a petty cash voucher and what contract you will be using for your time? Also ask if you are to do this from home? If so, compensation will be needed for the use of home, insurance hike and utilities or will you or him be looking for a place to rent to make this required jam, or

My supervisor went to each worker and asked what jam they wanted me to make, and insists I make jam for each person. How can I get out of this? You don’t explain whether you have a close or closer relationship with the coworker who provided you the original fruit. How many people are in your office (whether one or one hundred, your supervisor shouldn’t have done what he/she did). Did the recipient of the jam make sure everyeone knew you did this just for them when they shared, as perhaps part of an o 

How can I become charismatic?
There is a lot of mystique surrounding Charisma. This benefits the people that already 'just get it', making having charisma more rare and more valuable. Most charismatic people were lucky by having the right social experiences throughout their live that taught them to behave in ways that are inherently socially liked. Charisma isn't indescribable or inborn like many like to believe. Charisma starts with your mental and physical expression towards the outside world. Human beings are superficial. Physical attractiveness matters a lot in our social interactions which is why it's important to look 

That’s an intriguing question! And to a certain extent, you have answered your own question! :) I do observe such behavior and question (myself) what they did or am doing to make themselves more attractive. Most of the time my conclusion boils down to one word. CONFIDENCE This is a word which we have been telling ourselves repeatedly since we are young; before we go to the stage to deliver our graduation speech, before we walk up to the person we like to express our affection, before we enter that interview room for our job application and etc, you get the gist. However, if we were confident, we k

If you aren’t charismatic you probably never will be. My public speaking consultants encouraged us to stay within our personality type and to use our natural strengths. I, for example, was not charismatic or an instantly likeable type. The instructors, however noted two strengths as I spoke. One was that I came across as very honest and trustworthy. They verified this with audience feedback. The other was that I spoke with above average clarity. Again, verified with audience feedback. I had a gift for explaining something complicated so that everyone was able to understand it. They also noted a 

If you’ve ever met someone likable, yet you couldn’t explain specifically why you like them, that means they have charisma. You can learn to be charismatic too, and all it takes is some modifications to your behavior. Charisma is about what you say and do as opposed to who you really are as a person. Your subconscious, social cues, physical expression and the way you treat others all play a part in developing your charisma. “Presence” is the most important aspect of charisma, with confidence being a close second. Presence is all about being truly engaged with others. Essentially, you’re showing 

Let’s first make the difference of being ‘cocky’ and having charisma. Cocky people are the in your face, over confident, self opinionated, over opinionated and under experienced. You will have come across many in middle management positions. They were appointed because the interviewer mistook their confidence as super positive and infectious. This type get by in life contributing little but taking a lot. Your hard work will always support their existence because they are basically lazy. They will never lead by example, but delegate responsibilities. Their lack of experience and knowledge means 

Counterintuitively, charisma can come from embracing yourself for the excellent person you already are. More often than not efforts to attain that mythical goal of charisma are efforts to achieve some other end, perhaps procuring attention of all sorts via a magnetic personality.  Rather than attempting to achieve that goal, think of it as what would it take for you to be happy and unrestrained.  If you behave in a way that secures your own happiness while respecting others sufficiently you're one step closer to achieving your goals. Ironically those who focus on enjoying themselves are often actu 

 What do we look for in others? What is the thing that makes us like someone? What makes some people seem to gravitate around others? How are those people different from the rest? Charisma is a way to describe this general sensation. It’s the pull a person has towards others, like the gravitational force of a planet they just seem to pull people in. Why? And what makes that person so charismatic? And how do we become more charismatic?  #1 - Stability Life is like a raging river. It throws us for loops, gives us no stability at all, and the twists, turns, and rocks along the way can sink our little dingy  

I was struggling as a writer. I wanted to write a book but there was nothing to inspire me, so I thought. I said that to my friend who is a writer too. I said, “I wish I was charismatic, someone who just attracted the ideas, the attention of the right people, resources and just made things happen.” That’s when he shared something valuable with me. “It’s called 360 degrees.”“What is it?”“You turn your life around completelly and you become charismatic. You won’t have this problem with writing, meeting influential people, attract attention and mostly whatever you want. There’s only 3 steps, that’s 

“Being present — paying attention to what’s going on rather than being caught up in your thoughts — can yield immense rewards.

What are the types of people that you should always avoid?
Avoid is probably not enough. I was once in my apartment which I was renting with my girlfriend some 10 years ago. She invited one of her girl friends over to our place to see each other and have a cup of tea. She showed up with her boyfriend. It was September, they had just returned from their vacations in Asia. They hadn’t seen each other for months and they were eager to show each other all the cool stuff they had been experiencing. Our vacations were not that exotic as theirs but quite interesting through the Balkans, where my girlfriend got to meet my parents and family. Being from a Norther 

I understand that my answer will probably affect more who lives abroad than who doesn’t and has not interest in leaving his/her own country, but in my fairly long experience away from my own country, what I really came to avoid is people that moved to a country and keeps complaining about everything and everyone there, and constantly talking about how much he/she misses home, and how “things are better there”.For example, I lived in London for a few years, and was sick and tired of talking with Italians (I am Italian, I guess the name tells it) that, holding their slice of pizza take-away bou 

I’ve been living 39 years and in that time I’ve met thousands of people. I’ve worked with people in numerous industries and from all walks of life. I’ve never had the luxury of avoiding a single person or type, and have been thrust into interactions with everyone from the poorest disabled woman to an actual billionaire. Here is my list of the types of people you should unequivocally avoid being friends with, or being kind to. But rather than avoiding them entirely, I would encourage you to speak out against these behaviours. Being able to keep doing what they’re doing in the dark is the reason  

put my two cents in here, excepting a few explanations already given by others: people who are too “nice”.

Here are the 10 types of people, among other, I try to avoid: 1. The “Askhole” The Askhole is the person who asks for your advice, tells you how wise and helpful it is, thanks you for it, does the exact opposite of what you advised, asks again for your advice on the same problem, and repeats this cycle to leave you eventually feeling like that pair of jeans which has seen one wash too many. 2. The I-me-I This is the person who talks about one thing and one thing only: himself. The I-me-I will leave you bone-tired - physically and mentally - with his incessant talking and almost unendurable, detail 

People who have a negative opinion about an entire demographic but tell you you're "different," or "one of the good ones," so you can be pals. You'll see people who are racist, or sexist, or hate an entire religion or nationality, but then "make an exception" for the few examples of people they happen to know. These people are ignorant and bigots. Don't be friends with them because they happen to like you. People who are perpetually self-destructive but will not acknowledge how their choices damage their lives. I'm not saying you should shun anyone with bad habits. We all have them to some deg

While not nearly as severe as some of the groups of people that were presented here, I’d like to propose the complete avoidance of those people that completely change depending on who they’re in a relationship with. You know, the Beckies and Selenas and Jordans who fall intensely in-love with people they barely know and are ready to put their lives on the line for these strangers, even compromising their being. I’ve met two of these cases so far. One of them was an incredibly meek guy. The type of person who soils himself just because you moved too fast for some reason. He was hopelessly romantic 

People that heavily trash talk their exes. Instant red flag. You loved them once. Give your past relationships respect and move on.People that “one up” all of your stories and achievements. This usually means the person is an extremely insecure and vindictive person who secretly wants you to do badly so that they feel better about their own shortcomings. They’re the kind of friend that just can’t be sincerely happy for you.People that hardcore flirt with people’s boyfriends or girlfriends in front of their partners, often making sure the person notices it.

They may also treat you as a certain kind of competitor, wanting the same things as you, or developing the same hobbies as you, and want to surpass you.And if they can’t be better than you, they will find ways to destroy your happiness.

This was late in the evening, and few people were in Walmart at the time.

I am often there for a while, and generally go to purchase things several times in the course of a visit.

It was after dinner, so I asked my dad if I could have M&amp;Ms, he said yes, on my way to the front I checked the toy aisle because I always had a laugh at the extremely overpriced items. I grab a bag of M&amp;Ms from the front, and I might have put the bag into my pocket (even then I remember not being sure if I did that or not), then I walked to the back of the store where the pharmacy was. I handed the M&amp;Ms to my dad and he payed for them and his allergy medication. While he was paying I heard a female voice behind me say s 

Yes I have. My husband and I were doing home improvement work at the time and went into a small chain of stores located in a very small town. My husband has a lot of tattoos and we get discriminated against A LOT for this even though he's a better man than most could even hope to be. While my husband was looking at tools, I went to go look at some random things and happened to see a vinyl floor tile that was on display that I thought was kind of cool looking. I picked up the tile and went to show my husband. He agreed, and went back to looking at what he needed to get. I went to put the vinyl  

I did, once LONG ago. Being legally blind, I often travel with a folding white cane. Actually, now I use an National Federation of the Blind telescoping cane,) that, when folded, looked like a bundle of four white tubes. I was shopping in a toy store, just looking around, minding my own business, and carrying my white cane folded up in one hand. Needing both hands to examine something on a shelf, I tucked my folded cane into my purse. The cane was longer than the purse could accommodate, so it stuck out at the end. Not finding what I was looking for, finally, I decided I had better look elsewher 

My mother in law takes my baby out of my arms without asking my permission. She also passes my baby around to other people without my permission. How do I put a stop to this behavior without hurting her feelings?
Oh wow…well it’s pretty much up to you to set boundaries. By asking this question, it seems that this is not really a comfort zone for you. However you are now a mom, so strap up. Big girl panties on this one. People will do or treat you the way you ALLOW them too. This is your child first and foremost. I cannot remember a moment when someone took my son out of my hands when he was a baby without me allowing it. Maybe it was my RBF that threw them off, who knows. However my son is very socialized because I was the one that passed him along, allowing him to get comfortable with others. When my moth 

There are a lot of good answers here but one of them resonated with me more than the others and I thought I should tell you why. You are the child’s mother. No one else except the father (maybe) has any right to take the child from you or make decisions for him or her. This includes who gets to hold the baby. More, specifically, when dealing with parents and in-laws, they need to remember that they already raised their children and its your turn. I only came to realize this when my daughter was 10. I wish I had been told it sooner. My situation was different and over a long period of time. My in 

When my second son was born he was very jaundice. His bilirubin levels were fine only his skin and whites of his eyes were yellow and we were told to keep him in the sunshine. In February there aren't many sunny days in Ontario but his room would get afternoon sun right in his crib. And that's where I kept him. Plus, he was a good sleeper. This could be due to his jaundice, apparently, it makes them sleepy. So my SILs come to see the baby. One of them didn't want a family of her own and she concentrated on her career instead. She only loved her nephews while they were babies and toddlers, as i 

While many things connected with your baby will require your “permission”, this probably isn't one of them. Your mother-in-law is from a different generation. She — obviously — loves her grandbaby and wants to share her grandbaby (and her love) with those around her. Unless the baby was a premature birth, or special needs infant, permission isn't required, and allowing Grandmother to share the baby establishes the following: Tolerance — Even if your mother-in-law is the wicked witch of the east, she deserves to have access to the baby. Holding the baby creates a bond, and feel-good chemicals inc

I find that often when people do things that make us uncomfortable it is because we have never communicated to them that it does. I agree with what someone said, that you are allowing your MIL to take your child from your arms, I doubt she is yanking him from you. MY advice is to tell them in no uncertain terms. She might think it harsh at first but will realize it in time. Tell her nicely, “It makes me uncomfortable when you take the baby without asking. I love that you want to spend time with the baby, I don’t mind, but if you could ask me before you do take him/her. I also don’t quite like h 

I had a similar situation, with my MIL. I was a new mother, with no mother of my own. My MIL took me under her wing, and was very good to me. Being I worked nights, on the weekends, and my husband was off on Wednesday’s and Thursday’s, my son would go to gramma’s on the weekends. Now when everyone was at my in-laws house (for a holiday or whatever), I noticed my MIL took over the parental responsibility of my son, even though I was there. I didn’t like this. I didn’t let my son have soda, or a lot of sweets and things like that. Yet my MIL would give in to him. I also noticed his behavior wasn’t  

You’re going to need to set up boundaries and people who have none, like your MIL, is not going to take them very well so you’re going to hurt her no matter what BUT you can still do it in a kind and loving manner. You should never allow someone to disrespect you out of fear of being undermined or have any mistakes tossed in your face, or anyone pressuring you that she should be able to do whatever she wants as the a grandmother. That’s the key word, GRANDmother, she’s NOT the mother, YOU ARE. If there is an issue with the MIL that becomes deeper, your husband should be backing you and the tru 

It took the St Judes Childrens hospital a month to release my firstborn to me back in 1975. On the way home, my stepmother was anxious to take him from my arms. But something happened to me, my heart started pounding, I became terrified that if she got her hands on him- I would never get him back. I felt sick and like getting out of the car and running away! I said NO! Later, I heard this hurt her feelings. But I promise you I didnt choose for the word NO to come out of my mouth it just happened…and I felt like a lioness roaring as I said it. I really couldnt help it. I grew up never having anyth 

Okaayyy, the most popular answers are basically telling you to communicate with her like she’s a lap dog. As much as we’d all like to put MIL’s in that place, wagging hands and fingers is not appropriate to do toward an adult female, especially not one who has control issues. The polite thing to do would be to let her know over coffee or tea or a quiet, private setting, that you want to respect her and will need her to ask for the baby and then take her if you agree. Tell her you know she would want the same respect and you appreciate her excitement to help yet you need a change moving forward.  

Are you kidding me? When I had my first (and only) kid, I was THRILLED to have him passed around to everyone in the room. I was free for a few moments to eat, drink, or godforbid, pee. I knew I’d get him back when it was time for a diaper change or he got cranky for “food.” Of course, my MIL had passed before I married her son, and my family members were just trying to get to know their youngest grandson/nephew/cousin and would not have argued if I’d asked for him back. There was one time when I attended a baby shower with my son when he was only about a month old. One “grandmother” asked to ho 

What are the types of people that you should always avoid?
Avoid is probably not enough. I was once in my apartment which I was renting with my girlfriend some 10 years ago. She invited one of her girl friends over to our place to see each other and have a cup of tea. She showed up with her boyfriend. It was September, they had just returned from their vacations in Asia. They hadn’t seen each other for months and they were eager to show each other all the cool stuff they had been experiencing. Our vacations were not that exotic as theirs but quite interesting through the Balkans, where my girlfriend got to meet my parents and family. Being from a Norther 

I understand that my answer will probably affect more who lives abroad than who doesn’t and has not interest in leaving his/her own country, but in my fairly long experience away from my own country, what I really came to avoid is people that moved to a country and keeps complaining about everything and everyone there, and constantly talking about how much he/she misses home, and how “things are better there”.For example, I lived in London for a few years, and was sick and tired of talking with Italians (I am Italian, I guess the name tells it) that, holding their slice of pizza take-away bou 

I’ve been living 39 years and in that time I’ve met thousands of people. I’ve worked with people in numerous industries and from all walks of life. I’ve never had the luxury of avoiding a single person or type, and have been thrust into interactions with everyone from the poorest disabled woman to an actual billionaire. Here is my list of the types of people you should unequivocally avoid being friends with, or being kind to. But rather than avoiding them entirely, I would encourage you to speak out against these behaviours. Being able to keep doing what they’re doing in the dark is the reason  

put my two cents in here, excepting a few explanations already given by others: people who are too “nice”. If it ever seems to you like there is something up about the way someone is always too nice, there probably is. Don’t chance it.Socio- and Psychopaths, if you can.Similarly, manipulative and toxic people. My sister is one of these. Toxic people, for the record:are usually nosy and want to know everything about anything you doare manipulative and will use any leverage they can get to screw you over in some waynothing is ever good enough for themthey are always way too preoccupied with their

Here are the 10 types of people, among other, I try to avoid: 1. The “Askhole” The Askhole is the person who asks for your advice, tells you how wise and helpful it is, thanks you for it, does the exact opposite of what you advised, asks again for your advice on the same problem, and repeats this cycle to leave you eventually feeling like that pair of jeans which has seen one wash too many. 2. The I-me-I This is the person who talks about one thing and one thing only: himself. The I-me-I will leave you bone-tired - physically and mentally - with his incessant talking and almost unendurable, detail 

People who have a negative opinion about an entire demographic but tell you you're "different," or "one of the good ones," so you can be pals. You'll see people who are racist, or sexist, or hate an entire religion or nationality, but then "make an exception" for the few examples of people they happen to know. These people are ignorant and bigots. Don't be friends with them because they happen to like you. People who are perpetually self-destructive but will not acknowledge how their choices damage their lives. I'm not saying you should shun anyone with bad habits. We all have them to some deg

While not nearly as severe as some of the groups of people that were presented here, I’d like to propose the complete avoidance of those people that completely change depending on who they’re in a relationship with. You know, the Beckies and Selenas and Jordans who fall intensely in-love with people they barely know and are ready to put their lives on the line for these strangers, even compromising their being. I’ve met two of these cases so far. One of them was an incredibly meek guy. The type of person who soils himself just because you moved too fast for some reason. He was hopelessly romantic 

People that heavily trash talk their exes. Instant red flag. You loved them once. Give your past relationships respect and move on.People that “one up” all of your stories and achievements. This usually means the person is an extremely insecure and vindictive person who secretly wants you to do badly so that they feel better about their own shortcomings. They’re the kind of friend that just can’t be sincerely happy for you.People that hardcore flirt with people’s boyfriends or girlfriends in front of their partners, often making sure the person notices it. These people suck. These people are o

1. Jealous: Can’t accept that you are better than themJealous friends can’t always appreciate you sincerely and be happy for you like real friends. They often cannot accept that you are better than them, and they may pour cold water on you when you are happy when you have achieved something. They may also treat you as a certain kind of competitor, wanting the same things as you, or developing the same hobbies as you, and want to surpass you.And if they can’t be better than you, they will find ways to destroy your happiness. In order not to see you getting better, they may even sabotage in se 

Here are some that I observe around me : Positivity freaks. These people demand that everything they see and hear or anybody they approach be shining with “positivity”. They will insinuate that positive talk, positive life, only seeing positive things, even being healthy, is a sign of possessing moral highground.Subtle braggers / subtle judges. They have a way of standing on a pedestal that is very subtle. And they can access the pedestal only if they can somehow subtlely judge, by subtlely bragging…. Their good only comes with the bad of others. I prefer an honest bragger.People who feel deepl

How do I tell my mom to leave me alone? I’m 15 and I’m not allowed to go upstairs in my room until I sleep. She even has to stay with me until I go to “bed”. Every time I call my friends my mom comes into the room and sits listening to us talk.
My mother was like this and I did basically what the other person described about following her around and giving her a taste of her own medicine at about 13yrs old and it worked to a degree. I was able to have calls in peace for a limited amount of time and she wasn’t so eager to be around me when I was the one watching her. She did replace my “free time” with chores, but I’d rather spend time alone washing dishes and vacuuming than be next to her. My mom (as well as my aunt) were control freaks. As I finished high school I got stronger and firmer about boundaries, but perhaps it was cultural 

Despite it's popularity, I disagree with the notion you should imitate your mother's behavior and make her “sick of the very sight of you.” This sounds like a recipe for trouble, to me. Your mother could get paranoid that you're hiding something, or frustrated that you're harassing her, honestly it could go a number of ways and almost none of them are any good. It's not a mature way to the handle the situation at all. Based off your question, her obsession with following you seems to be specific to you being alone in your room. There could be two reasons for this: she's paranoid, or you did som 

I posted this in response to another persons answer when they asked for an alternative to what they wrote. I then had someone say to post it. Here you go: Respectfully ask mom if you’ve done something that was inappropriate. Something offensive. Does she trust that you’ve taken good lessons from her parenting to heart? Then ask why she is behaving the way she is. Explain how it makes you feel and even if it does not change you’ve had some open communication. *This part was in reply to a suggestion that the child mirror Mom’s behavior: Playing this kind of game is ridiculous and only enforces the  

Spend the day following her around the house from room to room and sitting or standing so close to her that she can hardly move her arms. Try to follow her into her bedroom. The bathroom. Crowd the heck out of her. Get into her physical space. When the phone rings, follow her and try to get the ear part away from her head so that you can hear. Ask her to put it on SPEAKER. Ask her who she’s calling. Ask her what she’s writing. Ask her what she’s thinking. If your mother goes outside into the yard or garden, follow her. If she is going out in the car, demand to come along. If she has a friend come to v 

Your mum has got some trust issues I think, and needs help, assuming you are not exaggerating her actions. My grand daughter is also 15, and if her room door is closed we knock and wait for her to say if it’s okay to go in. Most of the time the door is left open, closed usually means she’s catching up on school work, it’s GCSE exams year for her, or she’s at her barre practising ballet moves. Is there an adult you could ask to speak to your mum, (your grandma, an aunty, a friend’s mum) in a nice way, to try to find out why she behaves like this, and to gently explain how it’s not normal to hove 

Wow. That is so inappropriate. You don't have a helicopter mom. You have a parasite. Honestly, I don't think that there's anything you can do, except maybe have compassion for her. Your mom is obviously a very frightened human being, so frightened that her fear prohibits her from having an appropriate relationship with her daughter and from performing her parental duties. (Which include allowing you to grow up.) My guess is that your mother experienced some horrific trauma in her childhood which left her feeling permanently unsafe. She needs therapy. Which you can't do. If you think that your mom wou 

In my opinion and I have some experience here, your mom might have a serious problem. You're best plan of action is not to try to talk to her but look into resources for getting help yourself. She is too attached to you and controlling. If she got this way, she is unlikely to change just because you ask her to. Don't just keep hoping that she will change. Can you get a counselor or speak with a social worker? Can you talk to someone at school? It's really a professional you need to help you learn how to manage your mom's behavior. But make sure you get someone who believes you because, even wi 

She’s obviously very concerned. Have there been incidents in the past that would lead to her feeling she needs to monitor you? Be honest with yourself. Has there been something untoward that she has found out about and disapproved of? Was there a situation where you were in danger from another person perhaps she thought someone was going to take advantage or abuse you? If not… then this is out of order and you’ll have to speak to her Maturely, quietly and calmly and tell her at your age you need a little privacy. Tell her she makes you feel uncomfortable and like a child who can’t be trusted. T 

Invade her personal space as well. If she can do it, you can to. Equal rights equal fights. Gotta influence the youth in a good way, am I right? Here’s how to do it (taken some tips from other people who have answered) -Follow her around. Like, everywhere. To the car, inside the shops, and never EVER be more than 4 feet away from her. -snoop through her stuff. Her phone, her purse, everything! If you find something like a s*x toy or something that could damage her health, scold her and question her about it! If it is something on her phone, interrogate her like she would if she goes through your 

It’s my sense there is a reason for her doing this. You may have crossed the line in her trust and now she will never let that happen again. Regardless of whatever issue there is, I agree with her, bedrooms are for sleeping. Teens are becoming too reclusive. It is not good for their mental health to be fixated on privacy when that level of privacy is not needed by anyone. Privacy is for changing, showers and pottie time. For the rest, you should be engaged in homework, chores and of course your phone calls after everything is done. So, I don’t really see this as a problem. You more or less give  

Have you ever had someone come for dinner at your place and they refused to eat anything?
It hasn’t happened at our house because my wife belongs on the Food Network, but I’ve done it at someone else’s house. Twenty-five years ago, I started a new job and was living on my own in a new city. My wife and children stayed back a couple of months so the kids could finish the school year in our old location, and they made the move when summer arrived. One of my new colleagues invited me to have dinner at his house on a Saturday to meet his family. I was happy to do this and asked what I should bring. “You can bring the beer.” That answer suited me perfectly, and I was ready. The day after t 

Many, many years ago I was newly married to my ex-husband, and struggling to make ends meet whilst on a teacher’s salary. My husband was a student and I was supporting him through his studies. We had very little and if it had not been for my parents’ help, we wouldn’t have made it through most months. The Headmistress of the school I worked at had been very good to me and she and her husband had hosted us at their home, or out to dinner, a number of times. I was frantically trying to save up enough to be able to afford to invite them for dinner, and after some time, I did. I had checked with the 

My ex’s brother got out of prison. He had served 25 straight years for the murder of the man who had killed their father. Honestly, I was very nervous about meeting him, and I had no idea of what to expect. He seemed like a humble guy, very nice and respectful when I finally did meet him. He was quiet and reserved. And very polite. But he never could quite get settled in any one place. He wasn’t on parole, and had very little guidance as to how to find a job and a place to live, and he just wandered around, panhandling for spare change and sleeping on park benches and at truck stops. He showed 

When I was in my early twenties, I shared a tiny house with another girl, who was called Sue. There really wasn’t much in the way of ready-made food in those days, and we tended to cook a home-made meal most nights, taking it in turns. We were VERY poor: although we lived well, we never had a surfeit of anything. It was a somewhat hand-to-mouth existence, but we were happy. The only thing that occasionally grated was having to house-share. It would have been nice to have been able to afford a place of my own. We lived in Brighton, which is on the coast and has really superb fish due to our fish 

OMG, this question totally made me LOL. My family knows that since I was a weeeee little girl I have always been a picky eater. Let me explain. I’m not what I call an “Entitled picky eater”, meaning I don’t project my pickiness onto others nor do I expect anyone to accommodate my likes and dislikes. I more or less quietly do my own thing. Eleven yrs ago I was preggo and my son’s father is from the area so he had family here. I didn’t. During that summer almost every weekend his twin sister would have a birthday party for one of their niece’s and nephew’s kids and the whole family would come ove 

Oh, I think I have a good one! It's one of the pettiest, stupidest things I've seen a grown up do… so let's start from the beginning. I had my MIL come to three different family gatherings at my place and refuse to eat anything on the table. Two occasions were small gatherings with only me, my husband and daughters, my parents and my parents-in-law. Third one was my daughter's birthday, and I had more guests, who would later ask if my MIL is always this unpleasant and weird. Everyone who enjoyed the food was talking about how great it was, and there was really a lot to eat, lots of choices too  

That has only happened once, but with a new girlfriend of one of my husband’s marine buddies. She made funny faces and pushed her food around on the plate throughout dinner, just like an ill behaved toddler might, but once she expressed confusion about the shape of a roast, we realized she’d never eaten real food before. I don’t mean to toot my own horn, but I am not a bad cook. I practice meticulous kitchen hygiene, I read recipes, and I use quality ingredients, so at the very least my meals should come out as edible, and I think they’re a good bit beyond that. If the appetites it dinner guest 

My bachelor graduation was every chef’s nightmare and a financial disaster. Very memorable. I have five siblings, but for budgetary reasons I only invited my parents and grandparents and (now ex) boyfriend. See, I was extremely broke. I worked my way through university, but all my money was spent on housing (I lived alone) and study costs. My budget was a mere 80 euro per month for food. In my country €170/mo is the bare minimum for a healthy, varied diet. So, I was somehow surviving on half of that, and on the brink of being underweight. For my graduation dinner, I prepared a lovely pumpkin/carr 

Forty years ago, we had possession of the gigantic (much bigger than a bread box) chrome plated electric rotisserie that my in-laws had won playing bingo sometime in the mid 50’s. That behemoth made the absolute best chicken I’ve ever eaten in my life—moist tender meat, nearly black crackling crisp skin. (I’ve mourned its demise for decades.) So, when we invited our new neighbors over for supper, I knew roast chicken had to be the main dish. To accompany; steamed fresh broccoli, a tossed salad, and my husband’s fave, parslied potatoes (boiled new potatoes drowned in butter, salt, and fresh pars 

Unfortunately, I was that person - twice. First time, my first ex-husband and I went to his friend’s house for dinner. They lived on a farm in a very large, ramshackle house. I was pregnant at the time. This is important later. I sneezed, my eyes watered, I started itching and broke out in hives as soon as we walked into the house. Mom was re-potting plants in the living room. Although they had many acres of land and a huge yard, she was doing this inside the house. There was literally no where to sit because each couch and chair was full of stuff. Laundry. Mail. Shopping bags. Etc. Their young 

What can I do about a neighbor who parks their vehicles in my yard?
What you should do is: First, establish that it is indeed your property. Yes, a certified survey. You may want to notify the neighbor that you are having a survey done, and perhaps he would also like to know where the lot lines are. They may apologize right then and there, saying oh, I know where the lot pins are, my bad. You might want to put up a legal fence just your side of or on the actual property line, or whatever setback may be required by local zoning laws. Some twine and flags along the lot line giving a visual reference to where the lots begin and end can go a long way. Or not. It’s  

Funny this question popped up in my feed today. I had an incident today (5/10/20). So, I am African-American--Black if you will, although my complexion is closer to caramel. And yes, this is a race story. I was driving through a neighborhood of non-descript homes built in the 1960s and 1970s. Clean, well kept, but nothing fancy…just standard American suburban housing. I was looking for the entrance to a park with a dog section I'd been told was in the area. I got a bit turned around, so pulled over onto a very short deadend side street to consult Lady Google. I got my bearings, and while sitting  

I live in a mobile home park and we all have 2 vehicle driveways. I have a neighbor with 3 vehicles, I currently have 1, so, what I did was make a deal with him. #1…he can use the empty space but if I have company, he has to move #2..i I get another vehicle,he’ll have to move elsewhere #3..for as long as he uses it, in the Winter, he cleans the entire driveway/cars including mine. That’s worked well for me, haven’t shoveled in 5 years, I’m in New England I HAVE come home a found cars blocking me or on my lawn (which is against park rules) and have announced, LOUDLY. they have 5 minutes to move or b 

I had a similar situation with my neighbor. She continued to use my front yard as her driveway and park the front end of her car vehicle in my yard. At first I approached her and explained that she was ruining my flower beds by parking in them. She stopped for about a week then started parking her entire car on my mulch and flower beds. I had a beautiful mulched area with a flower bed running along side of my yard and it went around my driveway on both sides. The side that was closest to her driveway was a foot away from her driveway so she should have had plenty of leeway. The last time she pa 

Make sure it’s your property they are parking on. Something that looks like it’s your back yard may be a part of a vacant lot or municipal/city property.Make sure they are aware that they are parking on your property without your permission. I would post signs that everyone can see and leave notes on their windshield. Unless it’s blatantly obvious, do not attribute their actions to malice.Consult with local law enforcement about your rights in this case. Depending on the jurisdiction you may have a number of legal actions at your disposal, from having them towed at their expense to preventing 

My neighbor parks in front of my house frequently. I really don’t care , I park in my driveway. I do get upset when they try to park two cars in front of my house. One day, the son came home and parked across half of my driveway. My husband walked over and asked them to move the car. Son was cooperative and went and moved his car. Meanwhile, mommy dear complained that there was not enough parking and they would have to walk too far, because “there is not enough parking”. They have a two car garage and driveway, it was empty. They are in their thirties or forties. Another neighbor parked their R 

This is unfortunate if you do not have a garage at your home. However, unless your community allows people to lease and pay for that space, there’s nothing you can do. You can always park your car in front of his home and then the war really starts. Why do you need this space? Talk to your neighbor and try to compromise. Tell him if he sees a ribbon on a pole you’re expecting guests so can he leave the space open. Or park your car there and let your friends park in your driveway. I wouldn’t buy a home unless it had a two or three-car garage with three parking spaces in the driveway. However, I  

When my parents first moved into their current house there was a pretty popular restaurant/bar on the property in front of it. Shortly after we moved in a bad storm took down about 10–15 ft of fence that separated the properties, they kept it like that because if they had a trailer or big truck that had to get onto the property it was easier to go through the hole in the fence and the owner of the restaurant didn’t mind. For whatever reason people thought they could park on my parents front yard. My dad would go into the restaurant and tell the people with the cars to move them, they wouldn’t, 

When I lived in Westview, a woman visiting next door parked in the middle of my front yard. It was a snowy winter evening and I’d closed my drapes and changed my clothes, so I knew nothing until a guy came to borrow a shovel to help her get unstuck. Being a nice person I said sure, and let them take what they needed. But I watched out the front window and they were trying to pry her car out of the ruts she’d made, with my garden tools, all of which were new. I went out in my slippers and bathrobe and told them all to step away so I could drive her car off my lawn, which I proceeded to do in le 

How long have you been allowing this to happen? If it has been a long time, you may have a problem making a case that this upsets you. Nonetheless, are you sure that the car is on your property? Have you told them not to park in your yard? Let your neighbor know what the next time the car is parked in your yard you will have it towed. Do this by sending a notice to your neighbor by certified mail with a return receipt, and then don’t chicken out, call the towing company. Be a bad ass. Involving the police in a dispute like this will probably not resolve anything, so don’t bother them. If you f 

If you're traveling by plane and a very obese person sits next to you and you basically can't move anymore, are you allowed to say anything in regards to changing your seat or anything of that sort?
I was on a flight with 3-wide seating on either side of the aisle. The plane was nearly fully booked. It was “cattle-car” seating (first on gets first choice) and I deliberately chose a center seat (the fuselage leans in too far on the window side and the aisle seat has flight attendant and “bathroom” traffic - it’s a personal quirk). Now, I was 6′4″ and about 250# at the time and a gentleman, boarding near last, got on who had to have weighed 500# carrying an infant (no ticket - no safety seat - this was back in the day when this was legal and infants weren’t ticketed - no idea if that’s still 

My guess if you quietly, politely, point out the problems with the plane staff, if a seat is open, you probably can move. Realize the other person is just as uncomfortable. Saw one guy get moved, for a different reason. I only flew on a puddle jumper once, I didn’t know the travel agent for work picked this thing, round trip, about 300 miles. I get on this thing, twin engine turbo prop, overhead wing, a school-bus with wings. I’m 6 foot, was then 200 lbs, I don’t think I could sit near the window, my knees hit the back of the seat in front of me. I couldn’t straighten them. My feet were in up aga 

This is something that many fat people have been talking about in lieu of the body positivity and fat acceptance/fa liberation movements. When a person is “obese” by airplane standards, what that means is s/he does not fit with ease into the existing seatbelt and usually has to bring or purchase an extender. Additionally, many people who cannot demonstrate the requisite range of motion are required to purchase two seats. Often this requirement is not made manifest until the person has already boarded. Just for the record, at my most anorexic and gymnast-flexible, I still had a hard time compressi 

It’s not just obese people. Over the last 20 years, conditions have gotten increasingly cramped. I’m not a large guy (150 lbs); I almost always am seated to a “seat hog” who spills over into my space (or a darned kid, but that’s a different thing). I can usually squeeze myself into a small enough space to be accommodating, and I usually try to get the window seat for that reason (and I can go for a while without peeing, while precious little junior there needs to pee every fifteen minutes). Usually, space issues can be resolved by polite conversationg with your big “seat buddy.” I do find that m

Happened once. I had to fly MEL-DOH once at short notice. I was last aboard the plane and as I made my way down the aisle it was clear which my seat was. It was the only empty one in the totally full plane. And in the next seat was an obese man. As I approached his face fell and he actually said “You’re not sitting here are ya?”. He’d had his stuff spread out on my seat not to mention a good part of himself. I could see that 13h next to him was going to be no fun for anyone. As I approached the FA, she was already shaking her head with “Sorry sir, it’s a full flight”. So I squeezed in next to him.  

That depends on how truly uncomfortable you are, sitting next to a very obese person. Having done it without feeling compelled to shame anyone or express my feelings of entitlement, I can tell you they are quite aware. They will feel just as bad about themselves as you feel “having to” sit next to them. Probably much worse than you: they are not only unable to move, they are now the subject of a situation in which they're making other people uncomfortable. If you can't move, talk. Say excuse me if you need to move an arm or reach for something. They get it. They're not going to shed a hundred  

I used to work for an airline in aftersales service commonly known as the complaints department, and had to deal often with passengers who could not enjoy their flight because of a passenger who was way larger than average. To answer this short: yes, you can point out to flight attendants that you want to be moved to another seat, and wherever they can they will try to offer you a better seat. However, they do not have to, and what’s worse for you in that situation, you’re not entitled to get your money back or a discount. The reason for this is that airlines follow a no discrimination policy wh 

I do think it is your choice to say something but…..I'm speaking from personal experience with a morbidly obese parent. They know they are bigger. I'm also aware they are embarrassed that they have to ask for 1 or maybe 2 seat belt extensions the second they walk on the plane. I normally had to sit next to my mom so it wouldn't matter that she didn't fit properly. I have heard all the comments, pointing and laughing because of my mom and grandpa. They do feel the hurt and are well aware of what's going on. I have traveled recently and sat next to a larger person that took up part of my seat. I 

Sure you can. But ultimately, the responsibility is yours. You can ask to be seated elsewhere. And if you ask, in most cases, you’ll be accommodated so long as another seat is available. However, if no other seat is available, then you're faced with a choice — to take that flight, knowing you will be inconvenienced and uncomfortable, or to get off the plane and ask to be seated on a later flight. If the door closes and you're still seated next to the big guy, then from an airline management perspective, you accepted the inconvenience that you could have avoided by getting off the plane. And cons 

“Allowed?” Allowed by whom? Passenger: Excuse me, Mr. Flight Attendant, is there any chance you could move me to a diff… Flight Attendant: Sorry, but you're not allowed to ask me that. Passenger: Oh, you mean there are no other free seats? Flight Attendant: No, I mean you're not allowed to ask. According to FAA regulations, the only questions you're allowed to ask me are, “What time is it,” “Can I have cream and sugar with that,” and “What is that monster doing on the wing?” Passenger: But… Flight Attendant: Sorry. I'm not allowed to listen to you anymore. Enjoy your flight! 1.2K views · View upvotes7Molly Stevens, former cog in the big wheel. Old. Been around. at Self-EmploymentUpdated 9 months ago

How did your parents shock you?
How do you deal with a mother in law who puts down your parenting ways and is coming for 10 days to visit?
What does Meghan Markle really want from the royal family?
Meghan wanted to be a Senior Royal, she expected to be up front with William and Catherine but she’s not a Senior Royal, she didn’t like having to curtsy to all of higher rank, she didn’t like having to adapt to the confines of the Family, she didn’t like the traditions, she managed to get Harry to change but she couldn’t get the rest of the family to change so she stamped her foot and walked out. In Canada, she expected that she would soon be back with the Family, under her conditions, that didn’t happen so she stamped her foot again and this time landed in LA. She still wanted things her own 

I think she wants fairness from the Royal family, the world makes up this blissful rendition of Royal life, that falls flat from reality. The courtiers make the rules and they seem to isolate family members and render their brains into mush. How many lives have to be destroyed before the RF circle the wagons and protect their own? Why couldn’t Prince Phillip have a military carrier and be a husband to the Queen? Why can’t all of the Queen’s children have important roles in the RF? Who cares if it diminished the major role of the king or queen, at least everyone would have access to funds and p 

In their Interview , they said Harry was cut off, and Archie didnt get a Title, remember she said Title first then corrected herself by saying its about Archie having security.  I believe Meghan wants Harry not to be “cut off”, and Archie to have a title before Charles becomes King. She used the word security but security means not just a bodyguard but can also mean Financial Security! I believe Meghan only equates Respect with having financial secuity. If this were just about having a bodyquard, I wouldnt see why they couldnt just hire one theirselves. They say they left cause Archie was denied 

Her way in everything! She wants all the royal trappings; she wants the grand houses, the titles, the money - everything. But she also wants to pick and choose what ‘work’ she does and turn up only when it suits her. On top of that, she wants SussexRoyal to be selling merchandise (of her choice) that will add to their coffers so she becomes richer than Croesus on the back of the RF. In addition, she wants to be a ‘celebrity’, able to jet off to make money from red carpet events, after dinner speeches and attending the best A-list parties in Hollywood and elsewhere (by private jet, of course)! And  

Attention. It really is all about attention. Anyone with half a brain who’s been following Meghan Markle for the past 3 years have actually noticed that all she does is to constantly try and get other’s to look at her. Compare her to the Duchess of Cambridge, you can easily the differences in attention-seeking behavior. It is a completely normal thing if you want to be a celeb. But she’s clearly going over the line now. Don’t get me wrong, I actually used to really like Meghan, until she showed her true colours. You can tell that she’s the sort of person who’s rude to others, and wants to be co 

Special treatment that’s what she wants. She doesn’t understand that since her son is so far from the throne that he doesn’t get a title. Remember she didn’t want to become a UK citizen after she married Harry that’s proof she never wanted to be a real part of the family. She shouldn’t have a title anyway since she isn’t a UK citizens she’s still an American citizen. If I was the queen I would strip them both of their titles and ban them. Harry has picked his side. He choose an outsider over his family and allowed that outsider tear his family apart. They won’t be together long. And if it’s ab 

H$M want to keep their salaries, titles, security, perks and work when and what charities they want to work from the USA. Since the UK is not around the corner, this is impossible. The UK does not owe the USA this type of service. They both resigned and walked away from their roles because they wanted to make their own money. It looks like they both forgot that detail. When you quit a job, you don’t get to keep your salary, insurance, and benefits for life. Their sense of entitlement is unrealistic. Meghan stated they lost so much. She lost her father.

She is Prince Harry ‘s wife and should be respected and treated as such,just like he is treated .Someone in the Palace should have made sure that she was treated with respect just like Catherine !

I don’t think she wants anything and I don’t think she expects anything. She’s been disappointed by her father, half sister, and her husbands family. She feels she has no one but Harry and herself.

My stand was not with my husband’s parents, but with my brother in law’s wife. My husband’s family is very tight knit. They will close ranks pretty quick when they don’t have a warm fuzzy feeling about someone. They have always kept her at arm’s length.

Although this event didn’t quite make it to having someone as a guest in my home, this one would probably kind of count. My sister complained about always having Christmas at her house, so I offered to have it at my newly built home. No big deal, we always figured she wanted to have it at her house because she was somewhat of a control freak. So in order to have Christmas dinner at my house, I made a stipulation of no smoking in my new home, with new carpet, new furniture, etc. I have mild asthma, but smoke is definitely a big trigger for me, and it doesn’t matter what kind of smoke.

What is something your father has done during your childhood that is unforgivable?
This is long, so TLDR below. A few things, the first two of which were to cover that he was having an affair. My parents moved away from where they met and settled elsewhere before I was born but Mum always loved the place they had met (although not because they had met there). Fast forward several years and it’s my eighth birthday. I’m an only child at this juncture. I get given a kitten for my birthday; we have three other cats but this one is mine. She’s black and dad brings her home in a container on the back of his motorbike. I’m instantly in love. As it happens, a couple of months later, my 

Expecting children to not be children. Dad wanted kids in the sense that he wanted little impressionable people he could impress his ideas and views on. Little boys that he could bring to his dad’s house and they they could all do boy things like camping, fishing, hiking, and such. He wanted quiet, obedient, and respectful little beings. Little beings that took his word as the holy grail, never asked questions, kept out of the way, and could read his mind. Obviously, he didn’t get exactly what he wanted. First of all, he had three girls. No boys. We still went camping and fishing. and partook i 

I'll start off by saying, that my dad past away 20 years ago from stomach cancer. So he is no longer in my life. But as a child I was always scared of him. He worked most the time as a butcher he was really good at it and we never went without food thank God. But he was also an alcoholic and a womanizer that like to cheat time and time again on my mom and beat on me when he had a bad day and a short fuse. He was always in a bad mood when he got home from work? And no matter how delicious my mom made dinner, he always had to point out some bullshit that was eralivent? He took joy out of making  

I am lucky enough to say that my father never did anything to me that is unforgivable. But, I had a friend who underwent such an experience. He didn’t have any parents and lived in an orphanage. His orphanage was near my home so I was lucky enough to meet him. When he turned 13, he was adopted by a single parent who was a male. That was probably the worst decision of his life. It is quite a long story so I will give you a brief. For the first few months, Ron (foster dad, the name changed) was an amazing father to him. After gaining his trust, Ron showed his real colors. Ron gave him food and wat 

When I was 7, my father was a drunkard asshole who was having an affair. My mum was amazing about it, when it became clear that the marriage couldn't be saved, she divorced him as neatly as possible. He didn't take it well. He had visitation rights, to meet at a special centre, but I remember the building and not him being there, so what does that tell you? His own lawyer washed his hands of him when he'd never turn up for the court dates to determine visitation. The happiest day of my childhood was the day I was able to change my surname to my mum's maiden name. It was something I'd been asking 

Edit: this is only one incident of many. I was not scarred from only the one incident. One time in the middle of the night, when I was a child, my father crashed into my room and wagged his finger at me and in an angry voice said to me, you’re just like your mother, you’re no good! And he stomped off. I was so frightened, that from that day on, I put empty glass bottles against the door to my room at night so that if he were to barge in again, I would be forewarned by the bottles, instead of being awakened by his loud voice. And I did not sleep peacefully, and I often worried and wondered why my 

It would be easier to say, what hasn’t he done. if I had to give one example, it would be the sexual abuse from the age of three which continued until I was 12 and I was removed from his care. The fact he was grooming me to be a stand in wife and wanting me to use birth control so he didn’t make me pregnant. This made me aware that the abuse would have carried on for many years. His constant wish that I would/act more grown up even at the tender age of 6 because any childish behaviour annoyed him. He often said “ why do you have to be so childish and I can remember to this day thinking but I am a 

There was a proverb that spoke of not only forgiving someone of a wrong doing, but forgetting that they ever harmed you. Someone in my childhood always said “forgive and forget” and move on. But sometimes things are done to us that cause damage that stays with us our entire lives. These are things that we struggle to overcome but we can't forget because the effect of those things haunt us every day of our lives. So what my father has done that is unforgivable, is really what he did that I am unable to forget. My father didn't raise me, he trained me. Instead of affection I experienced the sting 

My “birth-father” —- not my “Dad”. I was in the US Army - my now-ex and I were both stationed in So Korea. I had had 3 miscarriages and we adopted a child while we were there. I was/am SOOO proud of him (now 45) - I kind of expected to have a problem with Dad, being little-educated and a kind of “hill-billy” raised in the Arkansas hills. MY son and Dad hit it off with first eye-contact. I mean, it was INSTANT. I had to convince him to let my nearly-2 yr old go, so MOM could meet him LOL. SO - I took him to meet my birth-father and stepMom. Did NOT expect any problems - this man had more educati 

The simple answer, he never stopped the abuse I was receiving from my mother and he was the one who broke my ankle. Detailed answer goes like this: My mother physically abused me for 12 years. I was tied up, choked, slapped, kicked, had my hair ripped out leaving a bald spot, hit with a belt until I had welts, etc. The first memory I have of him is when I was sitting on the couch, knees to my chest, crying, and scared while my mother went into her bedroom and into her closet where she would bring out a pair of shoes at a time and threw them at my head. Sneakers, clogs, sandals, work boots, and th 

Have you ever accidentally seen your mother-in-law doing something she thought was private?
Quite a few years ago, my in-laws took their three sons and their families on a cruise to celebrate a milestone anniversary. I went with my mother-in-law to the bathroom after we had finished eating dinner. There were several stalls and there was a staff person in there as well. I don’t remember why she was there – maybe she was handing out paper towels. My mother-in-law went into the handicapped bathroom. I finished washing my hands so I was waiting for her just outside her stall. All of a sudden, this staff person accidentally leaned on the handicap button on the wall which opened the door -  

Lol! So many times. They were funny episodes. By nature iam very quiet and can sink into the corner of any room cuddling pillows and blankets. Technically I can blend into the decor without being noticed. This was 10 years ago when I was in my room and used to practice yoga and reiki studiously every day …. My mom in law wanted to try it and for 3 consecutive days she took reiki from me at night and slept soundly through the night without her insomnia pills. On the 4 th day she told me not to do any more reiki and she would manage. Evening as I was sitting in the room in one corner of the bed  

Last month, I got a surprise from my mother-in-law, what I was seeking over the years. In Feb, my mother-in-law came to visit us. She wanted a change of place and to see her son after a long time. One night, I woke up around 2 am to get a glass of water. My mother-in-law was walking in the living room. I got scared for a moment that why she is here at midnight. I asked about her health, she said, ‘She had light chest pain and feeling suffocated.’ Something wasn't good; I immediately called an ambulance. After hospitalization, the doctor said, she got a minor heart attack, and luckily, we admitted  

At first, yes. And my ex Mother-in-Law actually. I was 17 when I moved in with my ex-wife and her family. I was working a lot of midnight shifts at the time and would get home just around the time she was getting ready for work. The in laws bedroom was off of the living room and depending on where you sat and if the door was open, you could see certain parts of the bedroom. Well, I sat in the recliner usually having breakfast when I got home and several times, I saw her in various states of undress. I think eventually she realized I sat there so I could see her because I started to see more an 

My ex wife and I were on holiday with my then in laws, we were staying in a rented house,I went to the bathroom one morning passing the bedroom my in laws were using, the door was open so I decided to shut it for them, but before I did i checked to see no one was in the room. laying on the bed on a towel was my MIL and she had her legs apart as she was removing the hair from her pussy (back then I didnt think women her age did that) as i watched form behind the door she finished shaving it and began to play with herself this had my cock stiff in no time &amp; I began to masturbate coming at the sa 

I didn’t actually see her steal out of my purse but when my money was missing, it could have only been her. I was pregnant with my first child and I was taking her to run errands, (since she didn’t drive anymore; not because she was too old but just stopped, she liked being dependent) a little shopping, and then out to lunch. We ate at Panera. When the pager went off, I got up and retrieved our food. That’s when she did it. At our last stop, I went to pay for a clothing item and my $100 was missing. I was hormonal and perplexed. I started crying on the way home because it was the only cash I m 

Yes I have on several occasions, the first time that I saw her doing something that she was doing and thought that nobody was around, she was laying down on the couch at my father n laws house and I guess she forgot that I was in the other room lying down while my wife and her dad were taking our kids to a dentist appointment, so as I was lying there i began to hear something coming from the living room and so I quietly got up and made my way down the hallway and once i reached the end of the hallway I peeked around the corner and saw her lying there completely naked and rubbing all over her b

I accidentally walked in on mother inlaw just in her bra and panties, at first we kept it our secret seeings how she was in the front room when this happened.

As a matter of fact? I did. She has passed away as of 2006. So has her significant other. While visiting their home, we were bunking in the other part of their huge home and it had a split floor plan. I had been sleeping in late but I caught up and needed an aspirin so, I walked through the living room over to the other part of the house where she was giving him his meds. He had just gotten out of the hospital after having some type of heart surgery. She stood in front of him, handing him his pills. I don't know what he did wrong, but she raised her hand as though she was going to hit him and h 

What is the most important lesson in life?
Never seek happiness from other people. You will never be happy in life if you do, knowing the fact that you are your own master and you hold your own happiness.Never depend into people for anything, you will always be let down.Never hold your expectations high for anything, just be yourself and live for the moment being constantly who you are, because when we expect the most we always get let down.Never escape problems always try to face them and solve them, because if you do the problems get bigger and they will drain you out of your energy.Never allow people to dictate how you feel about yo

One day my husband and I fought on a simple and silly issue. He didn't close the door of our attached washroom!!! I should tell you a little background. I came from a small place. I was not used to this attached toilets at that time. For us, toilets would be the backside of independent houses. The ‘flat culture' was not rampant in small places. Even my dad's govt quarters we're having bathrooms and toilets separately at the backside of the quarter though not outside of the house completely. I was unable to digest the reality of having a toilet on my back, the bedroom size was 12×17. It's very big 

The most important lessons could be If you do not learn on a war footing you are already obsoleteIf you have not failed enough, you have not tried enoughIf you are scared taking some action, it means it is an area of great developmentIf you do not have fear, that means you are living in your comfort zoneIf you are not growing, it simply means that you are taking riskIt is better to be alone than have company of toxic peopleThe most important things are not materialistic but the ones which gives you memorable momentsIt is never too late to start over again, to recreate, to reinvent yourself &amp; yo

I think the most important life lesson that everyone should grasp is learn to be independent living as a real human being in this world. The difference between a human being and a lower organism is the brain. We have brains enabling us to think. We could learn and make new stuff. We learn to use our brain to make judgment, to reason, to memorize, to imagine and to make plans. We learn to be adapted to new environment and solve new problems independently. We learn to make our living environment becoming better. We learn to create wealth for this world. The important lesson is some people are livi 

Everything is temporary, you too.Future is always uncertain.Infatuation is not the same as love. It may give us butterflies, goose bumps, and that “can’t eat, can’t sleep” type of feeling. Love takes time to grow, whereas infatuation may happen almost instantly.Your hormones rage, romantic feelings develop, enter in dating world and excited for physical intimacy. You should have the ability to control your own urge and know the pros and cons of physical intimacy.You will never be satisfied with what you have and continue to explore something new.Money is not everything in a relationship but wi

It’s been 10 days since I first left the city that I had been born and raised to start a new life. I was taking off to Korea to go live here for 2 years or 3. At the beginning, it was quite scary to live in the strange country of which I don’t speak the language, planning on taking over the business world. However, back in 2 weeks ago, people were to come up and ask me some questions, sort of “Are you crazy? Why Korea?” “What are you going to do when you graduate the school?” “Is it too risky? If I were you, I would choose EU or the U.S” ————————————————————————————— I have no answers for them though 

Some of the important lessons for life are : 1. We get treated in life the way we teach others to treat us. People will treat you the way you allow them to treat you. Respect and love yourself and others will do the same.﻿2. There are no mistakes, only lessons we need to master. If you learn from everything that happens to you, you will discover that there is no such thing as mistakes, only lessons to be learned. Ans if you don’t, chances are that your life will look at 40 the same way it did when you were 20. And at 60 the way it looked when you were 40…﻿3. Forgiveness is a gift you give to your

Never look down on other people or their choices. As humans, we have a tendency to get obsessed with our work and often choices. We get so engrossed in our way of living that we don’t tend to show empathy to other people’s choices. In the worst-case scenario, we begin to think it’s either my way or the highway. In this February, I was at the Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, Germany. It was the castle that inspired Disney’s Sleeping Beauty castle, so you can imagine that I was very excited to be there. I was accompanied by my childhood friend and while standing in the queue to get the tickets, m 

‘Re-Defining Your Belief Systems’ What are beliefs? Beliefs are our generalizations about our past, based on our positive and negative experiences. At times, the experiences of others, their stories, their past influences our belief systems and strengthens them. For instance: The belief that the harder you work, the more successful you will be. People are selfish, I cannot dance, Life is unfair are few other beliefs. Or an average human needs 6 to 8 hours of sleep daily. The point being, ‘Most people treat a belief as if it was some law of nature that abide by, but what it really is is a feeling  

What are some cool philosophical questions?
I don’t think ‘best’ should be used here; I’d prefer interesting. In this particular case, I am tempted to follow Albert Camus. According to him, the first question philosophy should try to answer is: Is life worth living? Albert Camus thiught that life and the world are absurd. Humans want to know and understand the world. The world however doesn’t let itself be understood. The fact that both humans and the world exist, since humans want to understand the world but the world doesn’t want to be understood. Besides of that, life is full of misery and so often seems so hostile to ourselves. If we  

I like the question raised by Nietzsche in the idea of eternal recurrence. He phrased it thus: “What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: ‘This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence—even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this momen 

Camus was a jerk! What a ridiculous assumption. To say, “…life has no meaning..” is utterly meaningless! Of course life has meaning. Knowing ourselves in our own experience is immensely meaningful. Existence is a function of relationship, and therefore, anything in relationship to itself is the very definition of ‘meaning’. For humans, the never ceasing (until death) dualistic to-ing and fro-ing between one experiential, felt, conscious, state to another is the very essence of meaningfulness. And of course, it’s ‘consciousness’ that makes it so. Maybe there was something lost in translation. I 

Why is Gamora?  OK, maybe not that exact question, but..  In all seriousness, the best philosophical question is simply why. When you boil it down, all of philosophy reverts back to this simple little word. People seriously underestimate the power of just asking why. It’s a sword, and it cuts right to the heart of our own ideas and the fundamental questions that our curiosity conjures up. It only works, though, when honesty is it’s outcome. If I ask someone why they’re spoiling their kids, they may say it’s because they love them. If they were totally honest, though, maybe they may come up with a num 

What is the best philosophical question? Should you believe me? as asked by any philosopher before speaking in public, or putting pen to paper or fingers on keyboard. Of course, nearly all of them get that wrong. That includes all of the other best questions, including whether I should believe you. Every infant has to come to grips with these. What is real? (with the two-dollar name ontology)What is true? (Epistemology)How do I know? (Also epistemology)What should I do? (Ethics)Historically, nearly all of the effort put into philosophy was wasted on trying to prove what philosophers and theologian 

Best isnt the correct word. However, I believe the question of the existence of “free will" is the most relevent to myself, to questions about “god and meaning” and to humanity in general. You can address it on a purely scientific level. Newtonian physics dictates that life is a grand rube goldberg machine in that every outcome has a cause. So if every outcome has a cause, the accumulation of a certain set of variables would always produce the same outcome with no wiggle room. If theres no wiggle room for alternative pathways of outcomes, wheres our free will? Of course we've gone beyond newton a 

Albert Camus was a French novelist of the mid-20th century. He would not call himself a “philosopher”, yet most of his books are considered relevant continental texts nowadays. His greatest problem, as he described it, was the question of suicide. He believed there was no point to doing philosophy, unless we could answer this question: “If life has no apparent meaning, why don’t we all commit suicide?” Needless to say, he wasn’t the most uplifting of guys. Indeed, it is a question which all philosophers struggle with at some point, and the answer is never simple: Sartre (Camus’ contemporary) said  

I read a lot of the answers given to your question and they are all interesting because they are about the "usual suspects": meaning of life, being, reality, truth, nothingness, etc. But come to think of it, I would say that if we are to pick one over another it would be because we "know" what "best" means. And if we ask ourselves this particular question we realize that yours leads to another. Is there an escape route to this apparently simple interrogation you come up with or is there a way to find the ultimate answer? How could we be sure that there is a "best philosophical question"? In m 

How do you decide if a human life has value? In The Dark Knight, there are two boats. One boat contains a group of hardened criminals who have done terrible things. The other boat contains ordinary, ‘good’ people of Gotham City. Unfortunately, both boats are rigged up with explosives. In each boat contains a detonator. Here is The Joker’s proposition: If the citizens of Gotham City blow up the criminals, they will not die. If the criminals blow up the citizens of Gotham City, they will not die. If neither of them decides to take any action by 12 AM, the Joker will blow both of them up. How do you decid 

I can immediately think of a good one, based on the low number of answers and views thereof: why are the most important questions not considered important? Irrespective of what they may be, the mere fact that there are more or less important things in life, implies that it's important to find out which ones are the most important. But people apparently don't care, which is even more absurd than the existential philosophy of Albert Camus, and that, in a personal, not merely logical sense. I intimate this in my book Sense Nonsense right from the start: If everything were transitory nothing would  

What is the difference between an intelligent person and a wise person?
Difference between intelligence and wisdom Acquired intelligence is none other than the knowledge, skill or ability you have in a specialized area. Human intelligence is the ability to think in a rational manner, interpret things in your environment and execute actions based on your thoughts as a human being. Innate intelligence is your natural born abilities (talents). Note that sometimes it's difficult to distinguish between acquired and innate abilities. We may not know what our innate abilities are until we try our hand at different things, hobbies, occupations, sports etc. Just like acquire 

Intelligence is a knife.Wit is an ice pick.Wit requires finesse with language, a sense of humor, and probably irony. You can be very smart but rather humorless and tongue-tied.  A nuanced sense of irony also might not be a necessary strong trait for a career as a physicist. In fact being adept with a turn of a phrase is not a requirement for many careers that nevertheless require a high degree of intelligence.  But it might be for, say, the profession of political speech-writer. As with the tired-out truism that demonstrates that although all four legged animals are not dogs, a dog is indeed a 

Last year, I went on a Tinder date in London. As an attractive, well educated, and extremely modest young woman, I naturally got plenty of matches. They all tried to get me to sleep with them one way or another, but here’s a summary of what an intelligent person did and what a wise person did. They were identical in terms of positives - both were well off, well educated, and good looking. But the way they approached the date was completely different. Mr IntelligentHe wanted to make sure I know how much potential he had. He told me in which bank he worked and what bonus he got. He lied to me he  

''Wisdom is a virtue, intelligence is a trait'' The difference between being wise and being intelligent is that wisdom is so much more than intelligence. As we all know, intelligent people can become wise, if they truly want to. All they have to do is to make a few changes in their behavior and knowledge and put in some effort. So, here are the differences between wise and smart people.  Talking and Listening Wise people tend to pay more attention to what others have to say and add comments occasionally whilst intelligent people like talking in order to express their opinions, views, and ideas.

What is the difference between an intelligent person and a wise person? Wise - the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment. Intelligence - a person with the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. One of the chief reasons for studying Adam Smith is to have a working idea of “the system”. All good students of Smith know the system is more than simply government or legislative, judicial, and executive powers. It is impossible to list all the powers included in the system but a good working list of the chief powers would be the following: Government proper. Corporations as they scratc 

“Honey, I got my hair done today, look at my new fringes!” Your wife says, running her fingers through her hair looking in the mirror. Your intelligence tells you that as a matter of fact, your wife’s new hair style isn’t as good as her last one. Your wisdom will tell you to keep your mouth shut. Let’s take a look at it in a broader manner: Intelligent people tend to process information in a logical way, whereas wise people process not just the logic, but the emotional, the spiritual, and the subtle side of the logic as well. This could be crucial at times when dealing with situations faced in pr

Intelligence is solving problems, making observations, learning, and being aware of your surroundings. Wisdom is being aware of the self, knowing right from wrong, morality, avoiding mistakes, predicting the future, and being strong. Wise people are more likely to be happy. They are balanced, resourceful, and good friends. Intelligent people may be happy but they may not be. They read, relate, listen, and think but they may be evil. From the Buddhist perspective wisdom is the ideal virtue. All virtues are just a type of wisdom including intelligence. Wisdom also includes kindness, courage, and s

Hello Abhishek! Thanks for the A2A. Intelligence is an ability to function appropriately in everyday life i.e. a basic capacity to deal with situations. In everyday life, people term someone who performs well in examinations, or who has some creative ideas for business, or who has a quick solution to a problem as ‘intelligent’. This is actually an abuse of the term, for in reality, even someone who does not really stand out, but manages to deal adequately with his life is intelligent. Intelligence is largely genetic, with most people showing an average intelligence from birth, while a few showi

How do you know if someone is mature or not?
They see beyond first impressions and always know that there’s far more to a person than meets the eye. Everyone has their own story and they aren’t quick to judge someone until they feel they know them. They know themselves. They know what’s good for them and they know what isn’t so good to have in their lives. They understand what makes them thrive and what drags them down. They forgive themselves if they fuck up from time to time too. They probably don’t gossip or, if they do listen to gossip, they are hesitant to bad-mouth someone who isn’t there to defend themselves. They know that problems 

There are 20 manifestations of a person's psychological maturity： 1. You realize that most people's bad behavior stems from fear and anxiety, not from filthy or stupidity, as people usually think. You put down your self-righteous attitude, no longer think that the world is only monsters or fools. Things are no longer black and white, but over time, it becomes much more interesting. 2. You understand that other people don't naturally understand what you think. You have to express your intention and feelings clearly in your own words. Don't blame others for not understanding you unless you can articu 

From my point of view maturity is When you feel you have wasted too many years chasing unproductive things. If you had worked on yourself, you could have been a different person.When you realise there is no use of arguing with few people. Better ignore for your own good.When you get to know, every law, authority or agency can bend or ignore rules for the influential and powerful people. Laws are for the average, poor or the people who have no contacts with powerful people.When you realise, the girl or boy, who meant the world to you, left like a stranger.

 Very easy. Maturity is difficult to fake. An immature person is an adult boy/girl. If you listen very well, these people will tell you themselves. Here are cues you should pay attention to: 1. Immature people are very often afraid of getting old. They'll lie about their age when they can and they don't dress or behave age-appropriate. The same way the mind hasn't developed much, they want a body that isn't aging. For them, emotional immaturity is a sign of a youthful mind and body, perhaps. It requires tremendous maturity to realize that aging and death are an indelible part of our existence an

I earlier used to run a travel photography page on Instagram. So I met this one girl in a class that I used to attend. She was a model with nearly 15k Instagram followers. While we were talking she randomly asked me for my Instagram ID.  Image source: Pinterest. This isn't her,this image is for representation purposes from Pinterest. I told her that I do not have a personal Instagram account and that I run a travel page. She opened my travel page on her phone and she checked out my photos.

Maturity is independent of one’s age. While growing older is a physical trait, gaining more maturity is an emotional trait. I believe the following 10 signs signal maturity in people. Mature people are not egotistic. They know that just having good education or a good job does not make one superior to others. Everyone has his or her own qualities. They know and understand that ego is the most self-destructive emotion in the world.Mature people do not hurt others intentionally. They are aware of how their words or actions might affect others, and try to ensure they do not hurt others unnecessaril

You know that moment when you don’t want to go out, but still like this you go out because your friends are going or because the pressure of somebody else.

What are ten truths everyone should accept in life?
1. You don’t matter. Or you do matter. It’s entirely up to you to decide that. It’s a stunningly lonely realization-that at some point, you have to decide your value outside of any societal validation-family, friends, true love, or status and success. In your early life, you will chase all those societal validations to seek your value-and you’ll find them all ultimately lacking at best and disappointing at worst. You’ll fall into a depression. Then you have a choice. Is there value to your life? Only you can decide that. No one can give you happiness nor peace until you have inherent value. Bu 

Life is unfair. There’s people who earn 6 figures doing nothing while you have a PHD and earn next to nothing. There’s the friend that’s better looking and funnier then you, and yes, even your current situation no matter how dim is favorable in comparison to a homeless kid in the Philippines.You’re more defined by your looks than your choices. A particularly handsome guy is sitting on the subway - perhaps in a suit and with a shiny watch on his wrist. On the contrary a balding gentleman with a scar on his face is sitting across from him. Let’s say the handsome man is a horrible serial killer, 

In no particular order: It could always be worse - Always appreciate what you have, because someone, somewhere, sometime has had it worse than you.It could always be better - Records are meant to be broken, you’ll never be “done” as long as you keep growing, and you can keep chasing perfection without ever having to feel bad about never reaching it.People are different - Not everyone will agree with you, not everyone will like the same things as you, and not everyone will see things your way given the same information. Accept it because diversity is what makes life interesting and makes us more

I dislike these questions, because nobody needs to blindly accept anything. Rage against the conventional wisdoms of your society. Figure out why they are the way they are. Not all of them are right. If I had to provide an answer, here are my alternatives to the usual “people suck” and “life’s not fair” — some happy truths, as it were: People are inherently self-centered to some degree, but that doesn’t mean they are inherently bad. It’s just that most people are “rational actors” in that they will do what is best for themselves and will respond to incentives that benefit themselves. This can in

Here are the ten truths one should accept early in their life to have a fulfilled life: Your first BF/GF might not be the one: We often open up and show our vulnerable side to our first ever partner but hard reality is that 98% of the first relationships never work out or never get converted to a marriage. Do not be so attached to your partner that you forget to respect yourself. You are young and naive; you let your guards down for the person but he/she might not feel the same for you. Do not let your first relationship come between your dreams. Do not let that person hurt you in any possible 

You will die, and most probably not a pleasant death, while asleep, surrounded by your loved ones.Things don't necessarily happen for a reason - many are accidents.Parenthood is the most intense experience there is, but the love you feel for your child is not always going to make you FEEL GOOD. Moreover, often it will make you feel miserable (for example, when you fear your child might die, and yes, you sometimes do).No matter how much you try, there will be times when the results of anything are much less than fulfilling. Interestingly enough, sometimes you will be surprised on how fulfilling

death is just as an important part of your life, as living is. Here in the US, most people try to prolong all aspects of aging. plastic surgery, hair dye, medications to keep hormones flowing. Why not just imbrace it and accept that we will eventually die.2. You really can’t love anyone in the proper healthy way in a relationship until you love yourself. Until you do, you’ll just be getting with the wrong people, trying to compensate looking for the qualities to makeup for your emptiness. If you focus on living your best life and following the path to happiness it will fall into place. The rig

What’s the purpose of living? Suffering?
There’s about 7.7 billion people on earth. If you eliminate one person every 10 seconds, it will take you 2,500 years to eliminate every one on earth. Jesus lived 2,000 years ago. That means, if when you saw Jesus coming, you started knocking people off one by one every 10 seconds, you still need another 500 years to finish the job. 55 million people die every year. That’s about 2 deaths per second. In the time I took to write this sentence, 10 people have died. By the end of today, 150,000 people would have died. Every six weeks, the entire population of Singapore of 6 million people is wiped  

My son asked me the same question a few weeks ago. My answer was: the purpose of living is to live. You will have no more suffering if you are awaken to the fact that all sufferings are due to desires. We desire to gain, and to not lose what we “have”; we desire to live, and to not lose our “lives” and the “lives” of our love ones. We suffer because of the fear, obligation, and guilt (F.O.G). We suffer because of the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion. All sufferings cease when we stop having desire. There is no more F.O.G., no more greed, hatred, and delusion. We will be happy, at least not  

“Purpose” is a human concept and only human creations, like machines, procedures, rules, etc. exist with a “purpose”. Universe and nature know no “purpose”, they just change, due to internal and external factors. And this is how life came to be. Earth’s atmosphere changed, Earth’s surface changed, Earth’s molecules changed into forming cells, cells changed into forming organisms, organisms changed into becoming increasingly self-aware. And there you are, alive and conscious for a short period of time, if compared to the existence of the planet and the universe; and with no “purpose”, because y 

Let's goto the heart of the question: How do I make sense of a world where suffering exists? Moreover, what is the meaning of life? Why am I here? Why are we here? And how do answers to these questions reconcile with suffering? Right? Wouldn't we all like answers to these questions without the usual caveats of “we can't know God's ways” obscuring a solid answer? Before I give you the answer, recognize that your Mind is going to react in one of three ways: That answer doesn't fit within my belief system.That answer is too simple. It must be more complicated.That’s an answer I hadn't considered.The  

We are here for testing; test environment necessitates struggle between good and evil. Testing missions are not supposed to be easy and comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance. Our life on earth is a very short period compared to the universe time scale; It could be a temporary test period. There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that as mentioned in the following answer: https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-... We have been asked to believe in God and Heaven but we have not seen God or heaven. Our fate will be determined based on that belief and on our good deeds.  

Suffering and happiness are possible side-effects of answering three fundamental needs: need for controlneed for connectionneed for consistencyHardwired into us by evolution, these needs ensured long ago that our ancestors behaved in ways that helped them both survive physically and reproduce. Today they ensure that we ‘survive’ psychologically (and reproduce). We all have those same three needs but they manifest themselves differently from one individual to the next. That is why it is crucial for each of us to explore our personal relationship with them. Details below. Directly or indirectly, the 

The question you’re asking is typical of what I call “the Reporter’s View”: the question comes from a perspective which imagines that the truth about meaning can be found objectively, like a reporter showing up at the scene of a crash to describe a truth which has already happen — leaving the reporter with little to do except describe the situation. If there were “a purpose of living” which had already bumped into something so that it could be observed and catalogued, then it would make sense to have reporters standing around describing it. But meaning (and purpose, which is a subset of meaning) 

Hello, **Explanation beforehand** I am answering this question through a religious perspective. I think everyone has the right to their own opinion and religion. I hope that with this answer, I can answer your question. The question you have asked: “What is the purpose of living”, has been asked by many people many times in history. I am going to answer your question from a religious standpoint: * If humans have been created from nothing, then there is no real purpose to our existence. Since our existence is just accidental. If this were to be true, then this would be a sad reality. Because this k 

Death is an unwritten loan of birth. The imaginary, hidden, invisible, sword of death, is always tied to every human being with a fixed unknown date of death. I can die of my own, meaning suicide, which is not legally permitted to any human being on earth. In between unknown birth and death of any human being lies the some what known part, as human living, life. I am the human being, I am not born on my choice. I am not born without my consent or my willing. It is irrelevent and hypothetical statement. I can not have my birth or death of my own. That means every human being is not having any say  

I think that the purpose of living is that: LIVE. I mean, take risks, do different things every day, meet new people wherevere you are, say thanks to the persons that help you and also sorry for the times that you hurt somebody. All humans think that we have a big purpose In Life, something that is going to give us happiness and infinit energy to live, but i think that small goals can bring us to that point. In Japannese Culture exists a word that involves all the things that im saying: KAIZEN: It says you that you have to do improves in all the aspects of your life, but not big improves if not  

Is there an XKCD for logical fallacy?
How do you know if someone is mature or not?
They see beyond first impressions and always know that there’s far more to a person than meets the eye. Everyone has their own story and they aren’t quick to judge someone until they feel they know them. They know themselves. They know what’s good for them and they know what isn’t so good to have in their lives. They understand what makes them thrive and what drags them down. They forgive themselves if they fuck up from time to time too. They probably don’t gossip or, if they do listen to gossip, they are hesitant to bad-mouth someone who isn’t there to defend themselves. They know that problems 

There are 20 manifestations of a person's psychological maturity： 1. You realize that most people's bad behavior stems from fear and anxiety, not from filthy or stupidity, as people usually think. You put down your self-righteous attitude, no longer think that the world is only monsters or fools. Things are no longer black and white, but over time, it becomes much more interesting. 2. You understand that other people don't naturally understand what you think. You have to express your intention and feelings clearly in your own words. Don't blame others for not understanding you unless you can articu 

From my point of view maturity is When you feel you have wasted too many years chasing unproductive things. If you had worked on yourself, you could have been a different person.When you realise there is no use of arguing with few people. Better ignore for your own good.When you get to know, every law, authority or agency can bend or ignore rules for the influential and powerful people. Laws are for the average, poor or the people who have no contacts with powerful people.When you realise, the girl or boy, who meant the world to you, left like a stranger. And you feel like you wasted precious t

Mature people realize that being independent is a life skill that everyone should have. It is true that we live interdependently with each other in society, but there are times where we have to shape our personal life in our own way.Mature people do not really mind how many people come to their birthday party. It is true that the more the merrier but as time goes by, they know that numbers are not everything.Mature people do not always share everything they do in social media. They know which details are appropriate to share and which ones should be kept all to themselves.Mature people know th

 Very easy. Maturity is difficult to fake. An immature person is an adult boy/girl. If you listen very well, these people will tell you themselves. Here are cues you should pay attention to: 1. Immature people are very often afraid of getting old. They'll lie about their age when they can and they don't dress or behave age-appropriate. The same way the mind hasn't developed much, they want a body that isn't aging. For them, emotional immaturity is a sign of a youthful mind and body, perhaps. It requires tremendous maturity to realize that aging and death are an indelible part of our existence an 

These are the 10 signs of Mature people and how they react : 1: Mature person will always try to avoid fight and forgive a person which shows how can he deals with bad people not up to their level. 2: Mature person know that not every woman is gold digger and not every man is a pervert. He understand the value of a person . 3: A mature person will Never judge a person or pass a comment until and unless he has spend a good time with that particular person. He will not make a perception about a person. 4: A mature person will never show off the expensive item he owns or will not put everything on In 

I earlier used to run a travel photography page on Instagram. So I met this one girl in a class that I used to attend. She was a model with nearly 15k Instagram followers. While we were talking she randomly asked me for my Instagram ID.  Image source: Pinterest. This isn't her,this image is for representation purposes from Pinterest. I told her that I do not have a personal Instagram account and that I run a travel page. She opened my travel page on her phone and she checked out my photos. She appeared to be impressed and she hit the follow button. And she asked me to follow her back. I told her ve 

Maturity is independent of one’s age. While growing older is a physical trait, gaining more maturity is an emotional trait. I believe the following 10 signs signal maturity in people. Mature people are not egotistic. They know that just having good education or a good job does not make one superior to others. Everyone has his or her own qualities. They know and understand that ego is the most self-destructive emotion in the world.Mature people do not hurt others intentionally. They are aware of how their words or actions might affect others, and try to ensure they do not hurt others unnecessaril

It's quite easy to classify a person into mature and immature category. Qualities that you are growing towards maturity includes- When your career and your family becomes your priorityYou take strong decisions for your parent's sake leaving all marvellous distractions asideYou don't cry aloud to the world for your problems. Instead you are thankful to God because you always have an idea that there are people who are living more miserable life than you.You choose ears smartly!You don't feel the need to share your problems with the world.Even if you do, you choose smart people who don't give you

Why does Fox News say that atheism is a religion?
First of all, “Fox News” didn’t “say” any such thing. Their site featured an opinion piece written by a preacher named Johnnie Moore and interviewed him regarding his book—seven years ago! Why are so many omitting those and many other facts related to this issue? Can ANYONE (on either side) just be completely honest and forthcoming when discussing atheism and religion? While Fox News, like every other channel in the world, has a certain ideological or editorial bent, one person saying something on the channel is not “Fox News” saying it—even if that person works for Fox News. But as to why Mr. 

Because Fox News’ target audience is old, conservative Christians who think that atheism is a religion. And you should never alienate your target audience.  Atheism is the lack of belief in any gods. It is no more a religion than theism. To argue that atheism is a religion, is to argue that Christianity, Norse Paganism, and Aztec blood cults are a religion, are all the same religion, because they all fall under the banner of theism. Which is absurd. Atheism is not a religion, for the simple reason that besides not believing in any gods, atheists have nothing in common. Technically an atheist can e 

This is a very common claim among Christians who don’t understand what atheism is. In fact, it’s something that I actually used to believe, back when I was a Christian myself. Many people who have been Christians their whole lives—especially those who subscribe to a particular form of Evangelical Christianity—are only familiar with the specific religious tradition that they have been raised in. Consequently, they tend to subconsciously project their own belief system onto others. They therefore mistakenly assume that atheism inherently involves believing in a specific set of ideas and living on 

I don’t care much about Fox News. But I do agree that most atheists are ironically religious in their approach. You know, some atheists make me think … “for someone who doesn’t believe in God, you sure AF bitch about him a lot”. And if you think about it, atheism kinda is a religion. Because you are taking a stance that “there is no God”. Now obviously, atheism is supposed to only mean the absence of belief in God(s). But most atheists are highly militant and feel the need to project their stance, which is particularly embarrassing when they are armed with weaker arguments than their Christian 

Because it is. Atheism is a fad cult whose followers worship Richard Dawkins instead of God. And I might point out that Atheism is most notably the only religion that is self deluded enough to claim to be backed by science. Most Atheist followers are even more ignorant, dogmatic, and fanatical about their chosen “spiritual” path than most Muslims, Christians, Hindoos, and Jews I’ve had the pleasure to conversate with. Ironically Atheism is the most fundamentalistic religion known to man. I mean if you think killing 5 billion theist equates to world peace, or, more precisely that as long as people 

Atheism, in its broadest (or most abstract) definition, does not meet the criteria for religion. It generally makes no affirmative spiritual, supernatural, or otherworldly claims (it lacks the statement of those claims in the first place). It has no unifying rituals, dogmas, creeds, or worldviews. An atheist need not have a “replacement” god in capital-lettered “Science,” “Rationality,” contrary to what the Fox News opinion piece claims. If someone claims to be an atheist, we cannot draw any conclusions about that person other than those that logically follow from the knowledge that they lack  

Why does Fox News say that atheism is a religion? Fallacy. You have to realize that Fox News is funded by Christian groups, so any of their news is biased. The article itself is written by Rev. Johnnie Moore (a commissioner on the United States Commission for International Religious Freedom and the president of The Congress of Christian Leaders), so any logical fallacies can easily be naysayed since this is ‘an opinion piece’. Fox may or may not believe in the article, but they just provide a platform (or pedestal) to a religious authority to spout nonsense about atheism being a religion too. Fo 

Well, for one thing, they didn’t. This is an opinion piece they have published and it was written by: Rev. Johnnie Moore is a commissioner on the United States Commission for International Religious Freedom and the president of The Congress of Christian Leaders. Now here are a couple of things.

According to academic.oup.com A religion need not be based on a belief in the existence of a supreme being, (or beings, for polytheistic faiths) nor must it be a mainstream faith.” Thus, the court(s have) concluded, atheism is equivalent to religion for purposes of the First Amendment. That said, that is probably the closest Fox News has gotten to a genuine factual conclusion for quite a while. We used to have rules in place by the FCC that required news organizations to be objective and truthful in their reporting. This worked well for reporting within the United States, until Fox News decided 

Atheism is a religion in the same way “not bowling” is a sport. I don’t have any “not bowling” trophies, I don’t go to “not bowling” tournaments. I don’t spend my weekends “not bowling”. I don’t meet up with my buddies for the purposes of not bowling. That’s not a social activity or a sport or a hobby. No one thinks this way, no one talks this way.

The same way non-belief in the conspiracy of lizard people is a religion. The same way non-belief in flat earth conspiracies i

Your question, as currently formed, is unanswerable due to the incorrect assumptions it makes and the false dichotomies it introduces by making the only options “yes” and “no.” The first problem is with the loaded term “creator.” Presumably, you are not just referring to any thing or process responsible for the existence of anything but instead to a very specific supernatural intelligence that purposely made things exist.

Q: Does it seem more logical to have faith in a creator as opposed to faith in the ideal that nothing created everything? Why or why not? A: Interesting word salad. Faith is rarely logical.

What the heck are you talking about? Science does not have any “faith” that nothing created everything. That is just a meaningless word salad.

Religious faith is over and above reason and is not to be subject to criteria generally used by reasoning beings. Reason why encouraging people to think analytically reduces their tendency to believe in gods. What you are asking is if it is better to take the  position instead of adm 

It makes no sense to have faith in the ideal or the idea that nothing created anything. It is illogical. It is not a matter of faith. That's why people who don't think a creator is real don't have faith in… the idea that nothing created everything. There are many presumptions here. You might think that there is a dichotomy: either a creator created everything or nothing created everything. I would challenge the notion of “created”. There is no reason to think that the universe was created. The only things we know for sure to be created are manmade things which are just transformation of existing  

“Does it seem more logical to have faith in a creator as opposed to faith in the ideal that nothing created everything? Why or why not?” Existence exists. Without reference to a creator. This is true but emotionally unsatisfying. Because people are often not satisfied with it, they add references to a creator. Such a creator can’t have any evidence because such a creator must be outside. All that does is kick the can farther down the road. We’re still at - Existence exists. Without reference to a creator.

Does it seem more logical to have faith in a creator You mean having ‘faith’ in something that cannot be proven to exist, and believing in something for which there is no evidence? It is NOT logical to believe in things for which there is no objective evidence. So, unless you think believing in fairies is logical, belief in a ‘creator’ is definitely NOT logical. as opposed to faith in the ideal that nothing created everything? That’s a nice straw-man you’ve built there, did you build it, or were you given it by someone else? The thing is, nobody says that ‘nothing created everything’. Science gener 

Everything did not come from nothing. I don’t get why that is still so difficult for people to understand in goddam 2021. The Big Bang Theory has never insinuated that from nothing came everything. Instead, it posits that—thanks to the 1st law of thermodynamics—all the matter and energy that exist in our universe had always existed, and was squashed into a tiny area 13.8 billion years ago. Then something—we still have no idea what—caused all that matter and energy to be released, causing an immediate and extremely rapid cosmic expansion that hasn’t stopped since. Now, we have the means to “look”  

It’s not logical at all to believe in a creator because there is no empirical evidence in support of the notion. It is not logical at all to believe that nothing created everything. Modern science does not claim that the universe emerged from nothing. The original so called Big Bang theory suggested the universe sprang forth from a singularity, essentially a dimensionless point source of energy. This follows directly from Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity. Today, the prevailing theory indicates that the universe emerged from a period of exponential inflation with the quantum energy of the

“Does it seem more logical to have faith in a creator as opposed to faith in the ideal that nothing created everything? Why or why not?” Existence exists. Without reference to a creator. This is true but emotionally unsatisfying. Because people are often not satisfied with it, they add references to a creator. Such a creator can’t have any evidence because such a creator must be outside. All that does is kick the can farther down the road. We’re still at - Existence exists. Without reference to a creator. If you notice that having a creator implies a creator of creators you are stuck in an infini 

Does it seem more logical to have faith in a creator You mean having ‘faith’ in something that cannot be proven to exist, and believing in something for which there is no evidence?

So, unless you think believing in fairies is logical, belief in a ‘creator’ is definitely NOT logical. as opposed to faith in the ideal that nothing created everything?

Everything did not come from nothing. I don’t get why that is still so difficult for people to understand in goddam 2021. The Big Bang Theory has never insinuated that from nothing came everything. Instead, it posits that—thanks to the 1st law of thermodynamics—all the matter and energy that exist in our universe had always existed, and was squashed into a tiny area 13.8 billion years ago. Then something—we still have no idea what—caused all that matter and energy to be released, causing an immediate and extremely rapid cosmic expansion that hasn’t stopped since. Now, we have the means to “look”  

It’s not logical at all to believe in a creator because there is no empirical evidence in support of the notion. It is not logical at all to believe that nothing created everything.

This follows directly from Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity.

Why does the West care so much about Chinese Muslims but treat Muslims in the West bad?
Many Hindus reject Allah's warning against associating partners with Allah in the belief that their gods will save them. How could Muslims convince Hindus of it being a grave sin thus help them to possibly avoid getting punished in hell for eternity?
The answer is quite long, see TL;DR; section at the bottom for short one. Let's answer the first part question first. Many Hindus reject Allah's warning against associating partners with Allah in the belief that their gods will save them. As a Muslim, can you mention ‘The name' of Allah, not His title or His quality. Like for example you are named ‘Ahmad’ not 'The most handsome man in the block’.

I was a Hindu, now an atheist, and I have spent considerable time studying Quran, Major Sunni Hadiths and Life of Mohammad. The reason why I rejected Islam is : The core concept of Islam is based on the creation story of Torah - which doesn’t make much sense.Belief in the Creation story is a pre requisite to be a true believer in Islam - since Quran claims Adam and Eve were the first humans it’s hard for people like me who believe in Evolution to believe in Islam.Most religions portray God as some megalomaniac with human qualities, Islam is no exception- it portrays god as someone who would puni

Question itself is hilarious and devoid of any sense. Allah for non muslims is not more than worth a piece of shit. Why would he or his warning matter? All religions are man made. They have good and bad things. Followers of dharmic religion accept the shortcomings and try to improve. For example Hinduism has gone under massive reforms and continuously evolving. On the other hand Abrahmic religion esp. Muslims are so much brain washed that they hardly able to understand the issue with Islam. Like a stagnant water Islam has become murky and stinky.

Hindus often disagree with Islam primarily because while addressing God Almighty as the Merciful, it does not actually portray Him as such. Their idea of God does not appear to be that of a kind Heavenly Father of the entire humanity but only an unrelenting and unforgiving monarch. Muslims portray God Almighty as someone related only to themselves. As if He has nothing do with the people of other religions whom He has created. A kind God does not burn people in permanent hell-fires, just because He is addressed and worshipped by a different name by different people. God was not born an Arab to  

Allah is supreme God. Surely, He must have some Energies/Powers? Or is He just a pile of rocks? Vaidik literature says these Energies/Powers of God are eternal, and are reposed in divine forms, i.e. they are personified. Thus, the ultimate, most important, and all-encompassing power of God, is represented by the Form of Radha, Seeta, etc. So, God doesn’t have an ordinary partner, who has captivated Him by her looks, etc. (Isn’t that why you are ashamed to think of Allah as having a partner?)

Without Partner, Allah will always remain a Muslim Boss. He is literally a Muslim boss. None of the high ego Boss like any partner. They like servants and slaves. They like praising all the time.

Allah ask all Muslims to follow prophet. This is a loop. This organization works like this.

Do atheists believe that the laws of logic don’t apply to the classical arguments for the existence of God (ontological, cosmological)?
Rather, atheists (and many religious people as well) would use the laws of logic to critically examine the classical arguments for God. The classical ontological argument for God is summarised as such by Wikipedia: It is a conceptual truth (or, so to speak, true by definition) that God is a being than which none greater can be imagined (that is, the greatest possible being that can be imagined).God exists as an idea in the mind.A being that exists as an idea in the mind and in reality is, other things being equal, greater than a being that exists only as an idea in the mind.Thus, if God exists o

The problem with these arguments is that they smuggle in assumptions. Let's start with the Kalam Cosmological Argument: Whatever begins to exist has a cause.The Universe began to exist.Therefore, the Universe has a cause.This one falls apart right in the first line. How do we know that "Whatever begins to exist has a cause"? What have we ever observed beginning to exist to justify that it had a cause? I mean, on an everyday level, everything I interact with has existed since the start of the universe – the material has simply been rearranged. For example, if I take a sheet of paper and fold it i 

I can only speak for my self, so I will do just that. I’m perfectly happy with the laws of logic being applied to any argument. The problem I have with with the Ontological and Kalām Cosmological Argument is the attempt to seek in unsupported premises. Let us take the KCA. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.The universe began to exist.Therefore, the universe has a cause.That is the original argument. What can we say about that. Well if you accept 1 &amp; 2 then the conclusion would logically follow to be true. But I don’t even accept that 1 is true and we don’t know if the universe isn’t eternal in 

Q: Do atheists believe that the laws of logic don’t apply to the classical arguments for the existence of God (ontological, cosmological)? No, it’s just that we actually understand what the laws of logic actually are, especially the difference between a “valid” argument (i.e., where the premises, if true, lead to the conclusion) and one that is actually “sound” (i.e., where the premises are actually shown to be true and the argument is otherwise valid). We also understand that logical arguments that claim to be able to prove one thing (e.g., the existence of the God of Christianity) but actually 

One of the books that encouraged me to study philosophy at university was The Miracle of Theism, by J.L.Mackie. It takes the major arguments for and against the existence of God, including various attempts at the ontological and cosmological proofs, and gives them a decent philosophical review. It was exactly the careful application of logic and rigour to that analysis that I found so attractive. What the book does demonstrate, though, is that if you think that you can either prove or disprove the arguments with some sort of irrefutable, simple logical deduction, then you haven't thought hard en 

Logic can’t help arguments that merely use the form of logic without actually being logical. As one comment I read on Quora recently pointed out: if the ontological argument is valid, the perfect girlfriend really exists because girlfriends that exist are better than girlfriends that don’t, so if I can describe what I want in a perfect girlfriend, then that girlfriend necessarily exists. That’s basically the ontological argument on a nutshell, with some God-thing (whatever that is) replacing girlfriend. The cosmological argument basically demands that we name whatever came first God, presuming t 

Not this atheist. One of the problems with the “classical” arguments for the existence of God is that the premises are either invalid or unvalidated. You simply can’t prove the statements that lead to the conclusion, so you get a valid and logical conclusion that is “worth” exactly what the invalid or unvalidated premises are “worth” and “proves” exactly what the invalid or unvalidated premises set up. Another problem is that these “classical” arguments for the existence of God can equally “prove” every god ever imagined. Or, as Diderot said of Pascal’s Wager “an Imam could reason the same way”. 

Original Question: Do atheists believe that the laws of logic don’t apply to the classical arguments for the existence of God (ontological, cosmological)? Logic only works on things which exist and which are demonstrably logical. Logical or ontological arguments to try to prove the existence of a god, no matter how complex those arguments might be, can never actually prove the existence of anything for which there is no observable evidence. Claims such as "God exists because the Bible says so", "the Bible is the word of God" and "Nature exists, therefore, it must have been created, and God is the 

Q: Do atheists believe that the laws of logic don’t apply to the classical arguments for the existence of God (ontological, cosmological)? A: No, atheism is not a belief. Any question that starts with “do atheists believe…?”, demonstrates the ignorance of the asker. There are no logical arguments that don't rely exclusively upon the presupposition of the believer's god's existence, and the nonexistence of all the gods that believer rejects as false. It's hypocrisy to demand disproof of your god or gods, without first disproving all the gods you don't believe in. The only logical position is to with 

Atheists have only one thing in common, they do not accept the existence of gods.

I have no doubt there are many different views on logic amongst different atheists, however the majority are quite happy to accept that the laws of logic apply to the matter. Those arguments you state are however simply not logical. The laws of logic contradict and disprove both ontologically and cosmological attempts at arguing for the existence of God, so it is you who don't accept the laws of

Was Buddha an incarnation (avtar) of Vishnu?
After the incarnation of Krishna, the Dwapara age ended and a few years only passed over since Kali age started. In this short span of time there is no necessity of establishing a separate Buddha apart from this Gautama Buddha. Of course, there are two reasons for such misunderstanding of our scholars: Gautama Buddha negated God as an atheist and Gautama Buddha said that the Vedas were written by human beings only (Paurusheya) Both these points are only misunderstandings of our scholars due to lack of correct interpretations of intentions of Gautama Buddha. Both these clarifications are: Gautama B 

Yes, definitely. Let me explain why. I am taking little roundabout way, long answer, so have patience. As we all know, Krishna was all powerful, and could defeat any army, alone, without much effort. If he wanted, he could have finished Mahabharata war in may be few minutes, by killing their whole kaurava army. That way, he could have saved whole bloodshed of ‘good’ people from Pandava army, including his nephew Abhimanyu, and all sons of Draupadi. Then why do you think, he did not do it? Instead chose to only provide tactical support and advice where needed, and let Pandavas fight their war. Bec 

It is well known that in some versions of the hindu scriptures, Lord Buddha is the ninth avatar of Vishnu and in some scriptures Balarama is the ninth one and there may already be many inherent internal debates among the hindu fraternity as to what is the truth. But from the lens of Hindu mythology (not religion), it does not matter. The story of Vishnu's major avatars or the Dashavatars as popularly known first came into light when it was compiled as a scripture in 12th century of Geeta Govinda which means the song of Lord Vishnu where the story of all the avatars is explained. As Ram avatar i 

Let's say Buddha was really an avatar of Vishnu and compare him with other avatars of Vishnu. One thing that we can clearly distinguish between other avatars of Vishnu and Buddha. All other avatars of Vishnu has killed one or more demons to protect the mankind while we see Buddha didn't do any such thing. And don't tell me Buddha protected the society from many evils and it was similar to eleminating devils, Asura or Rakshasha. Because there is no other Vishnu who didn't fight physically. So I doubt on Buddha being an avatar of Vishnu. Next thing is all other avatars of Vishnu has regarded Veda 

Buddha had broken from Vedik-System as he found high cast domination, intentional use of complicated language[1] (Sanskrit), and Karmkand [2]to be utterly useless compared to need of the day: to teach the essence of life and world without discrimination, lucidly elaborated in the languages of common people: Pali &amp; Prakrit[3].  As the society was oppressed and discriminated, his doctrine spread like ink in the water. Brahmin authorities had previously disowned him as Hindu preacher for he showed no respect to Vedik doctrines. They had not expected that against such a powerful and dominant clergy, Buddhis 

First let us consider some points: As per Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says "Dharmasamstapanarthaya: Sambavami yugeyuge" which translates as "Whenever There is a mass violation of righteousness, then I shall be born incarnate to restore the Eternal Dharma""Aham Brahmasmi:" (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad I.iv.10) Means "I am Brahman" or "I am God". This symbolises we all have godhead within us, those who optimise and maximise the godhead becomes enlightened teachers like avatars or prophets.All the Avatars were born human, lived human, attained specific enlightenment and died human their soul attaing 

Isn’t Buddha an avatar of Lord Vishnu? Let’s find the answer from various sources: Srimad Bhagavatam predicts the appearance of Lord Buddha as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. As per Bhagavatam, Lord Buddha would arrive to delude the evil forces by spreading non-Vedic teachings. Some of the excerpts from Srimad Bhagavatam regarding Buddha incarnation are as follows: “Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of Añjanā, in the province of Gayā, just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist.” [SB 1.3.24] “When the atheists, after 

No. The Puranas and other texts do mention Buddha as an avatar,but there is very, very little written about him compared to other avatars. It is like a forced addition. But most importantly, some references show him in a negative light, mostly as a "deluding figure" who takes "demons" away from the path of Vedas, making the annihilation of them by Devatas simpler. There is absolutely no mention of his teachings.  Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of Añjanā, in the province of Gayā, just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faith 

Certainly not. In this age of internet where an average clueless person can google the English translated text of Shastras (and blubber it back like the Indian Constitution) without proper Vedic knowledge or years of religious practice it's easy to be misguided. Every religious text has got modified and rewritten over centuries, by prejudiced kings who were grandsons of the clan to promote their own religion and ancestor. People with proper Vedic knowledge and religious practice can see the inserted one from the original. Say in Mahabharatha nearly ~11200 stanzas got added after Chanakyas death  

Simple answer both yes and no okay let me explain,there are two meanings of Buddha 1)one who attained spiritual intellect or bodhi,you can say followers of lord Buddha(Buddhism) 2)Statue The reason the first option is not applicable is because the teachings of Buddha and Krishna (an avatar of Vishnu) does not match in lot of ways,yeah though Vedic practices might have been been not followed properly at start of Kali Yuga but still if you see other teachings of Buddha and Bhagavad Gita or any Krishna leela, you would find differences,like buddhism is aethist religion or advaita philosophy type too(

He neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equiv

It is the most logical religion for several reasons. One of the biggest reasons is that all the philosophical and logical deductive arguments for God such as the cosmological argument or the ontological arguments that many theists use to prove God, can only prove the monotheistic God that is preached by Islam. These arguments are more inline with the Islamic definition of God than any other definition. Funny enough, these arguments were originally compiled by Christian theologians and few Islamic ones. If you really break down the religion of Islam it is a far more of a breathe of fresh air. The

Islam is a FAITH which means a subjective belief in a proposition without evidence or logic. The foundation of Islam is “the belief in revelation” i.e. Quran was orally revealed by Allah to the final prophet, Muhammad, through the archangel Gabriel, incrementally over a period of some 23 years. No revealed religion can lay claim to being “logical” because there is no evidence or rational argument that any Sky-guy revealed anything to anyone at any time. So in order to claim that Islam is “logical” the sponsor of this proposition must first prove beyond reasonable doubt:– That Allah actually exist

I’ve always looked young for my age.. I’m nearly 41 now, and am (finally) starting to get some grey hairs in my beard, which will help with the related problems somewhat. I struggle to say which of the issues has been the worst because they’ve all be pretty significant in different areas. To clarify this, I’ve had friends look over old photos of us hanging out (taken 10+ years ago), and call me to say that I still look exactly the same. “You haven’t aged at all, man!” I’ve been curious enough to check FaceBook for my old school friends… they’re all in various stages of going grey and bald, with  

When I was younger, I didn’t feel troubled by the fact that I have a baby face. Either way, I was still a kid so it didn’t make much of a difference if people’s guesses are off by some 1–2 years. But now that I’m an adult, my appearance sticks out like a sore thumb. And the way people have responded to it has really started to grate on my nerves.  How old do you think I am? I’m Indonesian, around 160cm tall (which is… what, 5′3?) with what some might consider as a petite frame. Some Asians would think I was around 15–17, and in Western countries people would just unanimously agree that I MUST be  

this is me now  well I'm mid 30s and never looked a day over 15 probably younger than that with the way girls are developing. My husband is 5 years older than me and we have 4 children, been together for over 10 years. here's a daily dosage of what I deal/dealt with… A cashier just stares confusingly at me and my husband and assumes I'm his teen daughter at first, then when I make a sweet gesture to him, now they stare at him like he's a pervert smh. We laugh now but it used to piss me off in the beginning. My husband is 6′0 200lbs. and a clown so he gets pleasure messing wit peeps mind.Any time 

It affects your life in so far as you are perceived. I am 36 and I am eastern european. The most common reaction when people like my coworkers, their spouses, my clients, etc., learn of my age, is disbelief. Most of them tell me they imagined I was 19 - 25 age range. Same thing if I get carded at a restaurant ordering a cocktail. “Wow, you don’t look 36” “What?! I thought you were like in college” I consider it flattering. There are negatives: I do find often times my clients don’t seem to take me as seriously as my older colleagues, and I do find myself having to remind people sometimes that I have 

I would like to add one effect of looking younger than your age - judgements about your life! I went to a department store to purchase some pajamas to put into a care package for my kid who lives out of state. Of course, my kid doesn’t need pajamas, but I just send her little gift packages here and there to let her know I’m thinking of her. Anyway, I go to pay for the pajamas and the woman comments that they are likely going to be much too big for me. I tell her that they are for my kid. She looks at me with a very strange look and it was like she was asking me how could my kid possibly be big  

I turned 32 in December 2019, but nobody ever guesses my age right based on appearance alone. Regardless, adding dark eye makeup, contour, body language, posing, business attire, more sophisticated clothes and hanging out in a more serious adult setting can definitely play the age up.  Sometimes, without makeup and in street wear, some people told me I could pass off for an 14 to 18 year old. I don’t think I do (I’m sure I look like I’ve gone through puberty) but that’s what some people typically guess, especially in western societies. They keep telling everyone when they find out my age or keep 

I am in my early 30s and usually mistaken for way younger than my age. I can write down some of the experiences here: I was asked for my id when I was visiting a casino. The security asked for another piece of id to confirm my age and then posted a red inked mark on my hand to show other staff members inside if they ask for my ID that I am legally eligible to enter the casino. The whole thing took 10mins which was driving other “adult” looking people nuts.I was in Las Vegas casino, I felt thirsty and asked for water to a waitress around. She wanted to see my ids before she served me water and t

I’m a 14 year old girl and 5’3 at last edit, but I’ve had numerous adults, usually men, mistake me for being older. When I was still 12, I had 2 people convinced I was a young adult within the space of about two days. The second time wasn’t that much, I was just getting some food from KFC and the man taking my order was talking to me, then he asked, “so, how old are you?” I told him I was twelve, since I wasn’t going to fake my age or anything, since to me I just thought I was too short and quite obviously a child. The man seemed so surprised, and did state he thought I was 18. It wasn’t too a 

I have always looked older than my age. I hit puberty at age 10, already reached my full height by age 12 and started shaving then. By the time I was 14 I could pass off as 20. I never got carded in my life. Not when buying alcohol, not when going to bars, not when going to strip clubs, not when watching R movies in the theater, etc. I never got bullied physically. I was too man-like for other boys around my age to pick fights with me. I’m not that big, only 5′8″ and currently 160 lbs. But I was already 5′8″ when I was 12, was around 140 lbs. of muscle by the time I was 14 and could even grow a  

What kind of people make you ashamed to be a human being?
The ones I've known too well — Nigerian Christians.  Don't get me wrong, these guys aren't your average Christians. Many Nigerian Christians are ignorant and have failed to understand it's other demographic of Christianity and religious beliefs, which causes religious conflict, plagiarism, tribalism and many immoral actions. Traditional beliefs have shaped majority of the Nigerian social standards and they've took it as part of the norm in their religion. And more so, this is due to high impact caused by it’s movie industries. In which, many modern day Nigerians consented to blindly. In a state in

What kind of people make me ashamed to be a human being? People like Gertrude Baniszewski (No, it’s not Estelle from Friends!)  To understand why I dislike Gertrude so much, you need to know the story of Sylvia Likens.  Lester Likens, Sylvia’s father, was a simple family man from northwest Indianapolis who was working multiple jobs to make ends meet for his family of 5 kids. In the summer of 1965, he and his wife decided to leave and work with carnivals selling food from concession cart. This required them to travel a lot and that meant they had to find someone to take care of their kids. Their old 

Thanks for the A2A. We could go on for days about this topic. But people that make me ashamed of being a human are people that are extremely judgmental and just write people off before you even get to know them. Example: Joseph Merrick.

What are some images that restore our faith in humanity?
 Here’s a picture of a two-year-old Nigerian toddler with a Danish caretaker. His superstitious parents thought he was a witch, and wants to harm them. So, unwilling to raise him, they abandoned him on the streets. They didn’t even consider taking him to an orphanage. The helpless child wandered the streets for eight months, left to the mercy of extreme weather conditions, and the crumbs he got from pedestrians. He slowly emaciated and became disoriented due to malnutrition. Fortunately, he was picked up by the charity worker who was horrified by his skeletal frame and pathetic condition. Overcome

What are some of the best moments of humanity?
Sir Nicholas Winton was perhaps one of the greatest heroes of the Holocaust - he saved the lives of 669 children. Yet his story was untold until almost half a century later. The story begins just before Christmas in 1938, when he passed up a ski-trip to instead go to Prague and assist his friend with refugee work.  Nazi Germany was beginning to occupy then-Czechoslovakia, and Jewish refugees were streaming into Prague. But they had nowhere to go, as almost all of Europe had closed its doors to them. Sir Winton was a stock broker - not a charity worker. But he was touched by the plight of these

For hundreds of thousands of years, humans did not brush their teeth. What happens if I stop altogether?
Homo neanderthal teeth fossils show toothpick marks (C Lulueza Fox 1992)  There are findings of prehistoric hominid fossils with dental caries as mentioned by Irwin D. Mandel - 1980, in australopithecine homo erectus in South Africa up to a million years ago! Late pleistocene neanderthal skulls also exhibit a certain percentage of tooth decay. This small percentage (up to 4%) of tooth decay has continued with homo sapiens through to the stone age and iron age (Hardwick 1960). After about 1950 there has been a huge increase, worldwide, of dental caries. This is largely attributed to wheat-flour fr 

I was going to answer anonymously too on this one, but everyone I really know knows what my teeth look like, so screw it. My parents were NEVER on me about brushing my teeth (Can't blame them. I was 8 out of 8 kids, so they were tired.) I brushed my teeth once or twice every couple days up till about age 12, and then stopped altogether. I didn't start back up again until very recently, because I'm going to be looking into implants soon, and I'd like to be in the habit of brushing new teeth (if I can afford them.) I am missing eleven teeth. Nine of those were pulled by dentists, the other two hav 

59 years old, I had abusive parents who did not like spending money on me… So one, if I did like brushing me teeth it was just something less they spent money on. I would be taken to a dentist one a year, he would spend 5 minutes looking around my in my mouth and NO x-rays. He never found and issue in my mouth either… My 1st cavity was at 18 years old as I was driving a road trip across the USA, coast to coast. My friend riding with me, laughing because he brushed every day… apologized when we got to a dentist several days later &amp; explained the tooth had shattered and exposed the root in 3 places 

people have actually been brushing their teeth for a long time and it’s also recorded in history, the earliest being 3000 B.C. Ancient civilizations used a “chew stick,” which was a thin twig with a frayed end. Tombs of the ancient Egyptians have been found containing toothsticks and other tools made from twigs to brush their teeth.  source: 10 Ways Ancient Egyptians Influenced Modern Life - Listverse  source: Key Features and Inventions In the 15th Century, the Chinese are believed to have invented the first natural bristle toothbrush made from the bristles from pigs' necks attached to a bone or b 

Great question. Our modern diets especially in the United States and in many other countries are high in different forms of sugar. One of the main bacteria that is responsible for our cavities is called streptococcus mutans; an anaerobic, gram positive. Think of it as a sugar eater and that is its source of food. I will not be too boring with all the scientific facts and details! In summary humans and winnie the pooh get cavities because we love sugars and honey :) The other really surprising reason for tooth loss is periodontal disease. So wait “You’re telling me I can have no cavities and sti 

Stopping your brushing habit may not lead you to eventual tooth loss. Believe it or not the patients in my office that have the least amount of cavities are not always the ones who have the best brushing habits. Most people don't realize that the modern diet filled with sugars and complex carbohydrates are the main cause of tooth loss. This by no means is a good reason to stop your habit of brushing and flossing. I will explain further. I think the real question being asked is are you golong lose all your teeth if you stop brushing. Unfortunately Based on clinical research the short answer is p 

I am a dental student who likes to read Quora from time to time. And voila, here’s a question that I can share some insights on :).As a lot of answers have described, prehistoric human beings have been taking care of their teeth in various ways. However, that is not to say that all of those ways are adequate.A few other things correctly answered by our lovely Quorians are that be it animals or our ancestors, caries was hardly even a concern for them and that if they really experienced some alveolar problems, it’d most likely be tooth wear - particularly attrition. Essentially, teeth-cleaning  

Well i can’t answer what will specifically happen to you if you stop brushing your teeth, but I grew up in South West Virginia and in a low-mid class family, where my parents, when they were growing up didn’t have much money either. My dad didn’t even know what a tooth brush was till he was way up in his teens, he said some of his teeth were rotten and black as they came through the gums, and he had teeth problems for years until he was finally able to get them removed in his 20’s. I on the other hand should have listened as well when my parents told me to brush my teeth, as they got bad over t 

Well I can tell you that I routinely only brush my teeth perhaps 2 or 3 times per week, and sometimes might even go a full week or so without brushing. And I'm now 48 years old and have some of the best teeth (and gums) of anyone I or my dentist know. (I don't tell my dentist how infrequently I brush because I do to want to hear it; he just always says that I'm taking care of my teeth exceptionally well). It may have a lot to do with genetics, and/or my theory is that I am very conscious/subconscious of how clean my teeth are, and I keep them clean with my tongue. I'll constantly rub my tongue  

Where a little erroneous knowledge can lead one's beliefs is astonishing - especially about a subject most people know very little. Dentistry is one of the more blindly bought items in the world; perhaps more so than diamonds.How tragic since teeth as so much more important o one's life and health.There is so much to say so I'll try to encapsulate it. Rest assured that all I say is 100% accurate. There are 2 major diseases in dentistry: cavities (dental caries) and gum disease (periodontal disease). They are separate diseases. Cavities are caused by what you eat and don't eat. Periodontal dis 

If humans suddenly disappeared, what would happen to our planet?
After just one day, the entire planet would be plunged into darkness. Most fossil fuel power stations would shut down, causing cascading blackouts worldwide, once they ran out of fuel. Solar panels and wind turbines would still be able to generate electricity in some areas of the planet, but eventually, they would stop working after a few months or a couple of years.  Nuclear power plants around the world would shut down and enter an automatic safe mode so as to prevent a possible meltdown of the nuclear reactor, without people to use the energy that these power plants make.  Also, no power means t 

This scenario seems impossible, but over the past thousand years, humans have faced numerous events that have threatened huge portions of the human population, such as the Black Death in the 14th century, which killed nearly 70% of Europe’s population, or the influenza pandemic in the early 1900’s that affected 75 million people worldwide. However, what if humans just disappeared suddenly – not due to some pandemic. Let’s look at the definite consequences one at a time. Impact on our Homes : Nature would regain supremacy on the planet without humans, and it is bound to begin with our homes. Witho 

My personal opinion is that it will become a far better environment. After all according to current statistics we are in danger of killing our planet off slowly but surely. I firmly believe that if all humans disappeared, this would be the opportunity the aliens from Planet Sky have been waiting for.  They will descend on earth with their myriad of spacecrafts and superior knowledge and visions, and get down to getting things in order. The first thing they will take into account is climate change and global warming because we humans definitely have not done an awfully good job in this respect. The 

Our planet is 4.5 billion years old, life is said to have come in to existence about 4.1 billion years ago (evidence found in 2015, remains of biotic life from 4.1 billion years ago in ancient rocks in western australia), however humans came in to existence some 250k years ago! A logical outcome here is that life existed and flourished in the world even before humans came in to existence, for example dinosaurs lived on earth for 160 million years, can you imagine? It was only due to some natural catastrophe that they became extinct. Now what shall happen if humans suddenly disappear? Ecological s

There have been 5 major extinctions in the 5 billion years history of Earth. And with the on-going pollution and excellent efforts by us to destroy most animal life on Earth and ocean, we may be looking at the 6th biggest mass extinction event. 1 The animals The very first effect would be that the power plants across the whole Earth will cease to work. With no humans to operate them and take care of them, the power plants will shut down, eventually shutting down the power on Earth. Next our extinction will directly affect the animals that we have domesticated either for food or as pets. It is est 

What would happen to the world without us supposing we disappeared for non-destructive reason (Like a nuclear war or so) would be very similar I believe to the following: *Humans just magically faded away or everysingle one of them falls death to the ground* 2 days after humans disappear Without pumping many cities subway systems including those in New York would impassibly flood.   7 days The emergency fuel supply to diesel generators that circulate cooling water to nuclear reactors cores would run out.   Somewhat similar to what happened to Japan's Fukushima nuclear reactor, the consecuences o 

Greetings family.. wassup? How's it going? Long time since I've been written an answer on quora.. So, without any delay, let's get started.. So, what would happen after humans disappear? Let's consider this hypothetical situation.. So, After just one day, the entire planet would be plunged into darkness. Most fossil fuel power stations would shut down, causing cascading blackouts worldwide, once they ran out of fuel.  Without people to use the electricity they produce, nuclear power plants would shut down and enter an automatic safe mode in order to prevent a possible meltdown of the reactor.  Also, 

Well, when everybody is thinking about the positive changes on our planet and that is we wish should happen, I would speculate the negative effects that could change our planet if humans suddenly disappear.  At that second, chaos will begin. Cars, aeroplanes, trains, LPG cylinders, ships, controlled processes in factories would crash and explode causing wild fires. Human indulgence could only stop these but sorry we are extinct. Eventually, it will be the scenario all over the world, each city and production sites. Until these small fires (yes small compared to what is coming next) spread to gas 

Thanks for the A2A!The immediate effects would be pretty chaotic- The factories,industries,power plants,and human-dependent technologies  would run out of fuel/power and cease to work.The effects of Nuclear Power Plant activities ,usually controlled by humans , going haywire would be detrimental to the entire planet and all its other living inhabitants!An occurrence of heavy rain shower could cause dams to burst(due to the unreleased accumulated water), resulting in uncontrollable floods which would prove harmful to other species of life.Another possibility would be a majority of landmass(and

Why does the Southern Hemisphere experience winter and summer solstices in different times than the Northern Hemisphere? I’ve answered this before. If humans disappeared, nature would start to take over and nature would do just fine without human beings, thank you very much. Mankind has encroached on nature. We have become too successful for our own good and are seriously overpopulating the planet. We are poisoning our own nest. Other species of animals have become extinct because of humans killing them off the the last animal in some cases, or in thinning them out so much that they couldn’t fi 

Who is the luckiest person on Earth?
Who is the luckiest person on Earth? In my opinion it would be Vesna Vulović. She holds the Guinness World record for surviving the highest fall without a parachute! She fell from a height of 10,160 meters( 33,330 feet), which is higher than Mt Everest, without a parachute and lived to tell the tale.  Vesna Vulovic  On 25th January 1972, Vesna was onboard the flight JAT Flight 367. At the time she was 22 years old and was working as a flight attendant onboard. The plane was flying from Stockholm to Belgrade and was supposed to make two stopovers one in Copenhagen and the other in Zagreb. The plane m 

Imagine surviving the Titanic by swimming through the arctic water with nothing more than a pair of shorts, then being one of the only survivors out of your 70 friends being blown up in WWI, and then escaping another sinking ship on the coast of Greece. This was a reality for John Priest- a British stoker (someone who puts coal into the ships’ furnaces) who survived so many ship crashes by the skin of his teeth that he was nicknamed the unsinkable stoker by the media.  Born in 1877 in a working class district in Southampton, England, it seemed like John naturally had luck on his side. In 1912 whe 

Here we go… 1. Joan R. Ginther - Fourth times a charm.  Did you know that the chance of you winning a lottery is 1 in 200 million? In fact, you are more likely to die getting struck by an asteroid than win a lottery. How would you explain Joan R. Ginther’s situation then? She won a lottery not once, but an unimaginable 4 times! Her life changed when she first won a cool $5.4 million, only to win $2 million more 10 years later. It doesn’t end there. 2 years later she won $3 million, and a staggering $10 million in 2008! 2.

I'm not sure whether this counts but here goes.   This guy here is Paul Gaylord(no he's straight). He was outside his house when his cat Charlie started yacking, as cats named Charlie (or anything else) tend to do. Charlie had tried to swallow a particularly disagreeable mouse, and was now quite disagreeably choking to death on it. He therefore stuck his finger down the throat and the cat bit his hand. That's bad, but then he contacted the goddamn Plague. His skin turned grey and he was rushed to hospital. Paul was in a coma for a month, during which he progressed through the bubonic plague's big 

A 17 year old girl fell 10,000 feet and survived after the plane shattered mid air above the Amazon rainforest. She was the only survivor amongst all the passengers. The plane had broken into fragments in mid air after being struck by lightning during a severe thunderstorm. She is the luckiest person because life is of absolute importance and she survived a 10,000 feet free fall.  This miracle survivor is Juliane Koepcke (Diller), a German Peruvian. She was a teenager in 1971 when she was the lone survivor of the LANSA Flight 508 plane crash. She fell strapped to her seat and it is believed that

She is the second luckiest person on Earth. Lena Pahlsson  In 1995 swedish woman Lena Pahlsson set aside her wedding ring to do some Christmas baking. But when she went to return it to its rightful place on her finger, she discovered it was gone. After years of searching, she and her husband came to the conclusion that the ring was lost forever. That is, until 2012, nearly 16 years later, when Lena found something waiting for her in her garden. While pulling up carrots, Pahlsson was shocked to find her long-lost ring around one of the carrots, an event so amazing it caused her to let out a scream 

 Frane Selak (born June 14, 1929 is a Croatian man who has allegedly escaped death seven times, and afterward won the lottery in 2003, prompting journalists to dub him "the world's luckiest man". Selak's brushes with death started in January 1962 when he was riding a train through a cold, rainy canyon and the train flipped off the tracks and crashed in a river. Someone pulled Selak to safety, while 17 other unfortunate passengers drowned. Selak suffered a broken arm and hypothermia. The next year, during his first and only plane ride, he was blown out of a malfunctioning plane door and landed in 

THE MAN WHO DIED, CAME BACK TO LIFE AND WON THE LOTTO TWICE- THE SECOND TIME WHEN REENACTING THE FIRST WIN FOR THE MEDIA In 1999, 37 year old Bill Morgan was a truck driver living in a travel trailer in Australia. That’s when disaster struck- while working, he got in a pretty bad accident that he nonetheless survived. However, medication he was given during his recovery resulted in him having an extreme allergic reaction that ultimately caused his heart to stop. After being clinically dead for fourteen minutes, they were able to get his heart going again. Sometimes with that span, the person may 

The luckiest person ever to exist is Frane Selak. He is called the world’s luckiest man. The Croatian music teacher has cheated death seven times.

Which people prove that humans are capable of changing themselves?
I believe its gotta be Frank William Abagnale Jr.  He is currently one of the most sought after security consultants, in the United States, working with consulting financial institutions, corporations, and law enforcement agencies on fraud and security. To date, he has serviced more than 14,000 companies. But he came into the spotlight because of his past. A former con man, check forger, and impostor between the ages of 15 and 21, he became one of the most notorious impostors, claiming to have assumed as many as eight identities, which includes an airline pilot, a physician, a U.S. Bureau of Pris 

Meet Nicolas Cage  Nicholas Cage is an award-winning actor starring in such iconic films like Leaving Las Vegas, Face Off, Con Air, and The Rock. He is the man who made The Rock famous even before Dwayne Johnson was a thing. That’s like, a Chuck Norris-level feat.  He had various properties in the US, Europe and the Bahamas. He owned a huge comic book collection and had many #1 issues which collectors would die to own. He donated millions to Amnesty International and other charities, like the victims of Hurricane Katrina. He had a net worth of $150 million at one point. He was living the life. But a 

Which people prove that humans are capable of changing themselves?  This gentleman is Hauptmann(Captain) Wilm Hosenfeld, of the Wehrmacht. Yes, that is indeed a swastika on his breast. Herr Hosenfeld was a card-carrying member of the NSDAP, colloquially referred to as the Nazi Party, from 1935 until his death in 1952. He is a pious Roman Catholic of Prussian origin, and a veteran of WWI, where he received the Iron Cross Second Class. He is also recognized as khasidei umót ha'olám(Righteous Among the Nations) by the State of Israel. Wait, what? But he’s a Nazi! Yes he is. I’ll explain. Hauptmann Ho 

I was a missionary in all parts of northern Italy from 2014–2016. In Genoa/Genova I met a man we’ll name Marco to protect his identity. Marco was pretty high up as a boss within the Italian mafia, I stopped him on the street and asked him where he was going and if he felt okay as he came off very nervous and looked unwell. Marco was very quietly spoken and a reserved person as you can imagine.. needless to say he’d had pretty negative experiences which led him to be who he was. After meeting with Marco about twice a week for a period of 6 months he had changed very slowly but surely which was unex 

Malcolm X changed not once, but twice.  At first he was a common street criminal, a burglar among other things. He got sent to prison, and while there, he converted to the Nation of Islam’s style of “Islam”. That’s the organization currently headed by Louis Farrakhan—an extremist, black supremacist organization. Malcolm played a big part in developing that organization—so big, in fact, that the public generally assumed he, not Elijah Muhammad, was the leader of the organization of the time. But Malcolm took a trip to Mecca (as every Muslim is supposed to do at least once in their life) and he dis 

Mark Wahlberg was charged with attempted murder, pleaded guilty to assault and served jail time and had a history of violence before becoming an actor. Russel Brand had a history of drug addiction, alcohol dependency and was a serial womanizer before becoming spiritual. Typically it takes a painful situation in life to generate a paradigm shift. Paradigm shifts can be made when the brain attaches severe pain to an experience which cause someone to no longer partake in the said activity.

Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last 30 years, you surely would’ve heard of one Mike Tyson.  Ask any casual viewer to name 3 boxers and he would mention Tyson, Ali and probably Floyd jr. Mike set the world on fire in the late 80’s for his amazing skills and one punch KO power. Under his guardian Cus d’Amato, Mike set forth to rule the heavyweight division of boxing. Before the Klitschko era, the heavyweight champ of boxing was pretty much the king of sports entertainment. Boxing, generally, attracts aggressive personalities. Tyson was no exception to this. Born in the slums of Brown 

I've read some good answers already given to this question. But what does, or can, “changing themselves” mean? From what I read its interpretation has been pretty consistent, so I want to address it a little differently like a couple answers leaned toward doing. My short answer is none. That's because I'd like to use a different definition of “changing themselves”. You see, pretty much everyone in other answers were the same person albeit with some altered characteristics. But what I'm using as a definition is a changed identity (Not the superficial name changes of marriage, etc). I believe that 

Let's say you've decided to make some changes in your life. You're out of shape, your mind wanders, your self-esteem is wavering, and you have no idea what you just read. So you decide to focus on one thing -- losing weight, maybe -- and tackle the other issues later. You don't want to take on too much at once, right?  A new paper by researchers at UC Santa Barbara, however, suggests you're selling yourself short. "Pushing the Limits: Cognitive, Affective &amp; Neural Plasticity Revealed by an Intensive Multifaceted Intervention," published this week in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, strongly sugg 

While there are many interesting people in the answers I will go with someone that has managed to push the boundaries of what can be achieved as a human. Wim Hof, also known as the Iceman. A Dutch extreme athlete noted for his ability to withstand freezing temperatures. He has set Guinness world records for swimming under ice and prolonged full-body contact with ice, and still holds the record for a barefoot half-marathon on ice and snow. What makes this person interesting is the fact that he could modulate his immune system, something that was thought of being impossible. In the hypothalamus, str 

What did you believe for way too long as a child?
What is something that you swear happened but you have no proof and nobody believes you?
Back in 2011, I was heading home after finishing a shift at my part-time retail job here in Ottawa. I used to work at the Winners on Merivale Road and upon completion of my shift, would regularly walk up the hill on Meadowlands Drive to the bus stop in front of the apartment buildings (my stop was the one heading east, in front of Horizon House). Like any other work day, I made my way toward the bus shelter, which usually by this time housed several other people also waiting to join the rush hour bus ride to get home for the day. Everything was fine - it was a beautiful evening albeit a bit ch 

So it's around 6am on a freezing winters morning. End of july 2017. In Western Sydney, Australia. I head over to a mates place and when I arrive, I give him a call to let him know I'm here. He tells me the back doors opened make a cuppa and he'll be out in 15 minutes. Now I'm sitting with my partner in the back yard, she's standing under an awning and I'm sitting between an awning on my mates man cave and the roof of his shed catching the only available sunshine, it's foggy and freezing. I hear this bird screech in the distance, it pauses and does it again then repeats and repeats. It's a bird  

I tossed this back and forth several times before deciding to share it. For one, the story is very hard to believe and I sometimes question myself if it really happened. Secondly, the man I will be discussing seems to be a very private person, it really doesn’t feel like my story to tell, it’s his. After some debate, I figure no one would be affected if I went anonymous, so here’s the most unbelievable thing I’ve ever witnessed: I’ve seen this guy for many years. I’ve lived in this city a very long time so I’m familiar with many of the locals especially in the area I live. Nearby my house is a  

My story may not be as unbelievable but it’s still weird and unresolved. So a bit of backstory. I lived and went to high school in a rather small town in Slovenia back in 07. I was also playing World of Warcraft at the time which is an online multiplayer game that at the time heavily relied on camaraderie between players. Sure enough, some of us became somewhat friends and we met for some picnics and stuff occasionally. Nothing yet weird here. At the end of high school, people in Slovenia traditionally go on an “excursion” somewhere, but it’s just an excuse to party our asses off and ours was in 

I love this question! I have read through pretty much all the answers and I just Can't get enough. I have so many I don't know where to start. When I was around the age of 14 and I was in my first year of high school I was going through a very rebellious stage. My grandmother had raised me a catholic and had always made me kneel and pray beside the bed before sleeping, we said grace before our meals and usually attended Church as often as we could. However being 14 and super cool I was telling everyone how I was am atheist and how silly my grandmother and others were for believing. You know sill 

 It was past 6 PM on a cold, winter night. Normally I would’ve driven to work, but the heavy snowfall the night before made taking the bus seem like the lesser of two evils. So now the workday was done, and I was riding the bus back home. It was mostly empty except for a scattered handful of passengers. Four to be exact, including myself. I sat closer to the rear than the front. On the first seat on the right side of the bus sat a young woman. Two male passengers sat farther back behind me, each on opposite sides of the aisle. It was a quiet ride until three ragged-looking young men hopped in. Th 

Back in the late 1980’s, early 1990’s, I was married to my (now) ex-husband and we had 6 children together. We owned one of those Toyota mini-vans, the kind with a pointed hood and a door on the side that slid open. It seated exactly 7 people but we used to cram 2 of the younger ones into 1 seat using 1 seatbelt, so technically they were all seatbelted whenever we went anywhere. Having a family that large meant that when we went out for day trips like to the beach or something, it was more practical (and cheaper) to pack a small portable Weber grill and bring along hotdogs, burgers, carne asada  

****I'm attaching a few actual pics, even though it still proves nothing…****   This is the one and only thing that I will never , ever in my life be able to explain completely. I don't know why, I don't know how, but it happened and to this day it freaks me the fuck out. So, about two years ago, I got called to work on a vacant house. I was asked to paint the entire interior of the house and rebuild the fence. I had a friend come help me, and the first day on the job I noticed that whoever lived there prior had measured all of their kids and grandkids in the entryway to the kitchen. You know what 

I don’t think anyone will believe me but I’d still like to tell someone… When I was 17 or so I accidentally kind of joined a cult. I was dating and later engaged to a guy that was was a member and somehow long story short he convinced me that I should join. I started going to his “church”, it was all in a different language that I couldn’t understand. That’s when all of the scary stuff started… I lived at home with my parents at the time in an old farmhouse that was built in the 1830’s. (I would like to say I have never believed in ghosts, I just thought it was all nonsense. I still think it is  

So it was in 1996, my wife and I for valentines day had a date day that evening we went to a Casino in Minnesota, we lived in Wisconsin but it was only like 2 hours or so. On our way back about 11 p.m. we went into Red Wing MN, I noticed a car had been behind us since the casino. I took a wrong turn on a highway and the car followed, no big deal just noticed it was still following us. When I realized my mistake, I turned around in a hotel parking lot, the car pulled in behind me, so I drove around the hotel, it followed me back onto the highway and I just punched the gas and lost the car by th 

What's the most ridiculous adult tantrum you've witnessed that you couldn't believe?
What, as a parent, could you not believe you had to explain to another parent?
I can't believe the amount of times that I have had to defend myself and my children towards other parents for our lifestyle choice, namely homeschooling. Both of my children are dyslexic to a certain degree. My eldest was in a very good private school up to grade 2. When I started homeschooling the following year, I discovered that she was mostly memorising her reading work, and that she could not really read. So we started from scratch. I read up about dyslexia . I joined support groups. I made use of online resources, the library, 1st hand and 2nd hand books, games like charades, play dough,  

I’m not a parent, so arguably, this was NONE of my business, but in my own defence, I did it automatically without thinking. I was a student doing a part-time job helping to run a toy library in a fairly “right on” part of town. And, as the “town” in question was Brighton, this might have been up there with some of the most “right on” places on the planet! Many of the most vociferous parents were extremely liberal with their views and I got used to NEVER assuming, for example, the sex of a child just by its haircut or clothes (these were pre-school children): boys might attend wearing a tutu, a 

That no, I will not isolate my son's younger brother during a playdate because she felt that her daughter shouldn't be around “younger" children. For reference, there is a 4 year age gap. My boys have always played together. When one has friends over, they all play together. Her daughter would call my house everyday, and ASK to be put on speakerphone so she could talk to both boys. So, her mom and I had set up a playdate at my house (my son was 9, she was 8, my younger son was 5). At the time, they were all into playing with cars, age appropriate video games (V-tech was big then), and other un 

Between jobs, I agreed to provide daycare for a 3-year-old girl. The kid was impossible. The mother was worse. Mom had ridiculous rules: all food was to be organic, no sugar, and no additives, ever. Do not bring food into the house. Do not watch Spongebob (there was a list of “approved” cartoons; I was not to deviate from it). The only food in the house was organic whole-wheat pasta with organic grated cheese. The little girl could only drink spring water. That was the only food in the house. Every lunch I fixed was the same: organic pasta and cheese with water. The kid had serious disciplinary pr 

When my son was little, we lived in military housing in Germany. Our stairwell, which had 6 apartments, had 3 other families with boys my son’s age. Awesome, right? Well, maybe not so much. My son, who I now know has Aspergers syndrome was a quieter child, inclined to play more by himself, read or watch videos than to play with other boys who, by nature, were more rowdy. But when my son would play, he often got picked on. Even with all the parents watching, it happened and was rarely corrected by the parents. It was always “boys will be boys” and let them work it out. Then when they saw that w 

The weirdest thing I got to explain to another parent is tough. So many times I couldn't believe that they would allow thier child to do or say things that were rude or just unacceptable. For my oldest son, it was probably that it was not acceptable for them to try to steal from him. He was in second grade and another student took his back pack. My son had a very unique bag and his name was written on the inside. We have a very unique name being that at the time their were 4 of us in this country. He called me crying that his back pack was gone. I went to the school and saw another child with i 

When my son was small, we used to have his birthday celebrations at home, each year, without fail. All the kids of the apartment complex were invited, irrespective of their age. The bonhomie and fun would start way before the actual day and continue for days after it. Such get-togethers tightened the bond between the kids and they were all thick pals. My neighbour had a son who was older than my kid. He was an energetic boy who would strangely become very quiet around his mother. This trait and the reason behind it became clear later on. Every evening, there used to be a steady stream of kids at 

I have a friend at work who is pretty immature, and he decided to have a baby with his wife. Since he seemed to be a narcissistic personality, a bunch of us were worried. Baby years weren’t so bad because mostly he was disinterested, but when his daughter became a toddler, the trouble started. He came in one day really upset. He was rushing her to get ready for daycare and forcing her to put her clothes on and she threw a temper tantrum. He continued to dress her and she bit him. So he bit her back really hard to teach her a lesson. His wife was furious with him. I explained that he was the ad 

I was working a job in another country, and both my employer and I frequently had to travel internationally. We were both single parents with small children. He had two (2 and 3), I had one (4). When I first met them, I thought the younger one had some kind of disability, and felt bad for the other, because it was like he had been pushed into being the younger one’s caretaker, even though he was that young. Didn’t take long before it was very clear, my boss, their daddy, didn’t want the youngest to grow up. He wanted him to always stay his baby. He even said so! He spoiled the youngest to the  

I was substitute teaching at an elementary school. A child came into the class around two hours late. I asked her why she was late and she said she didn’t feel like getting out of bed in the morning. We went on to the next class exercise and the late kid started fake crying about how she is adopted. I told her that she was lucky — that now she could have two birthdays — one when she was born and one when she was adopted. The kid continued to whine and just fart around on all of the class exercises. At the end of the day, the child’s adoptive mother came to pick her up early. I asked the mother i 

What scientific photos are hard to believe but are indeed real?
I am going to do something different with my answer. Am I going to show you beautiful pictures and beautiful gifs? Yes. Will you find them hard to believe? Yes, initially, but what you might find harder to believe is that in all of these photos and gifs you will see a common theme. The point of showing these is to make a sometimes difficult idea become clearer to everyone. The idea is Newton's third law, which is that for every action there is an equal opposite reaction. Once understood from pictures, it can be explained simply, and along with it, waves, thrust, lift, fractals and the Fibonacc 

Science is the second name of surprise. There are many photos, which are real but hard to believe. 1). The face on mars--  The image is captured by viking 1 orbiter of nasa. Scientists become very surprise when they come to know about it. The size of this face is nearly about 18 km. Scientists thought-"Have they found ALIENS." Really, it is very interesting. Is not? After research, they found that the image which looks like a face was the shadow of a mountain. And the image, when sun was at another direction, is----  2).

The most amazing photo in science ever taken and the one so hard to believe, is this one:  This is a photo taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2012 of a tiny tiny section of night sky. Called the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, it took 11 days of exposure to capture the light from these small dots. What is so mind-blowing about it is the fact that with the exception of two objects, no dot of light in this photo is a star. They are entire galaxies of stars, over 10,000 separate vast islands of stars spanning quadrillions of miles in size each. The dimmest dots actually represent galaxies that are ove 

Science is a vast and incredible field that has to offer an extensive amount of visual content that seems not from this world. It is never about what eyes you see something, but with what mindset you decide to see certain things. Some of us won’t want to believe in something even when we have hard evidence in front of our eyes. We need to believe that there are many extraordinary things in this world, things that we cannot yet understand but that are real and one day will change the course of our existence. Without further ado, here are my top picks of scientific photos that are hard to believe  

I’m going to go with what fascinates me every time I see it, even though most everyone has seen it already . . . don’t care. Here we go:  These are the Pillars of Creation within the Eagle Nebula – Or, in super sexy astronomer speak: NGC 6611. What fascinates me about this, aside from its beauty, the wonderful color, the structure – I mean, it truly is stellar – is its size. The middle column is a light year in diameter. The distance to Neptune from the Sun is four light hours (and 12 light minutes). Can you even fathom that distance? I can’t. So, I started trying to think in terms of what I can i 

I would say ‘scientific’ allows for a multitude of content. Posting the same question with each scientific line of inquiriy separately would also be nice.

Hello brother, How are you? These photos are hard to believe but they are indeed true. Before you look at them, know that the traits demonstrated here all have a scientific explanation such as, genetic deformities and adaptation to some illnesses that have made the body live with the affected limbs. Let us begin: The leaping Cuban Crocodile This is the Amazon’s deadliest predator after the Green Anaconda and the black panther. It can leap a record 9 meters high and grab prey from the trees into the Amazon river. It is also as fast in running as a leopard. 2. The longest nails in the world  Beautiful uh 

What is the strangest event you have witnessed that no one will ever believe?
“The road’s end came into sight as the car motion slowed to a creepy crawl. My heart was beating out of my chest. I struggled to breathe. Eyes agape I could not believe what I was seeing. I was going to die…” The Australian summer of 1976 was just perfect - with blue, sunny horizons and temptress turquoise oceans that lured me to it shores. With its intoxicating seaside breeze blowing through my hair I stood captivated; the cool tide massaging the soles of my feet. Taking in a deep breath, tingles emerged throughout my entire body. Closing my eyes…I savoured the moment….wishing it would never e 

I want to explain a backstory on myself before getting to the phenomenon. So you can understand why I find it to be pretty crazy. Just this last Friday I was at work, extremely happy and high on life. I've been like this for a while now. Everything in life is falling into place perfectly. The following characteristics of me are all new changes to me over the past two years, after hitting rock bottom from a breakup. I have great charisma and confidence, everywhere I go I spark up full-on conversations with complete strangers. I used to be extremely shy. People fall in love with me everywhere I go. 

I could actually tell you a multitude of such experience and events but I will give you one. Let me qualify this by saying I'm a firm believer in Jesus Christ. It was probably some 20 years ago. I was caught up in living life and I hadn't spoken to Mother in about 6 months. She lived in one town and I lived in another. Me and Mom were generally close but we were both caught up in the living of life at this point in time. Mom divorced Dad in 1978. Mom got remarried and Harry was a good man who I certainly approved of. It was the 1990's and as said, Mom and I were both caught up in living life and 

Well, this happened to me.. When I was 19, I was still in Turkey, after a year’s visit with my then fiancee’. He was a Turkish Army Officer, &amp; we had had a very big &amp; painful misunderstanding, therefore, we had decided to break things off for good, so I was flying back home to Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA, alone. I had earlier bought my airline tickets, &amp; after taking a few buses, a little train, &amp; a taxi to the airport in Ankara, was trying to board my plane &amp; fly back home to America. I was told to go up to a very long counter at one end of the lobby, which had about 6-10 airport employees working t 

The missing slipper! So this is about 6 years ago now but it’s still very fresh in both me and Wifey’s memories. This is absolutely 100% genuine. My partner and I were preparing to go upstairs for a nap of sorts on a Sunday about 4pm. We turned what needed to be turned off and the last thing I did was to take off my slippers. Wifey went upstairs before me and I know again 100% I took off my slippers and left them at the bottom of the stairs. This was very common of me; the times I had forgotten to put my slippers back on after being upstairs was hundreds of times I’m sure and it always resulted i 

I need to stress here that even though I have always believed in a Creator, I absolutely had no experience of a spiritual or supernatural nature. I had never seen a ghost, a UFO or Bigfoot and if someone spoke to me of having an experience like this, I was likely to chuckle about it. I’m a very logical, practical person. If you haven’t experienced these things for yourself, it’s difficult to wrap your mind around it. We lost our beloved oldest daughter in 2012. She was just 27 years old. Amidst the horror and agony of grief that descended on our family, unbelievable things started to happen imm 

This is pretty unbelievable and i was going to write it anonymously..but frankly i dont give a shit..if you believe me you do …if you dont then no big deal, i wouldnt believe someone who wrote this… but it is 100% truth in 2002 i used to walk the pennine moors near a place called Winter Hill in rivington lancashire..and on the way you walk past several reservoirs that feed Liverpool. anyway i used to like early morning walks on the weekend, and i walked past the reservoirs and up a very steep hill, from which you can see bolton, chorley, adlington and a few other places…anyway when i got to the  

I was in France to retrieve my 12 month old daughter who had been kidnapped by her father. I was 20 years old. After two months of not knowing where she was, her father eventually told me where they were and made me fly to Paris to come get her. I was flying in from Australia. But then, when I arrived, he said it was a trick and he was taking our daughter away and I’d never see her again. I was distraught! The only desperate move I could think of as he was holding her and putting her in a taxi, was to tell him I would get back together with him. I was literally on my knees on the street begging h 

This is not exactly an encounter, but I had a strange experience in two parts that began in high school and ended about 40 years later, for which I have no explanation. I was a senior in high school (in the US) and had a poem due the following day for my senior English class. I had written a little poetry before and I liked doing it, but I was busy and had put off this assignment until the night before it was due. I sat down to write, pen in hand, and a poem came—-a long, complex poem in a style very different than anything else I had ever written. I wrote the title, “Kubla Khan,” and then the  

Yes. A lot of things. Recently began investigating if there could be any possible evidence of anything paranormal or an afterlife. This was inspired because of a death in my family and I took a shot in the dark expecting nothing. I’m a logical minded atheist who “knew better” than to believe such nonsense. However - wow. I have definitely changed my mind since investigating. I wrote about my experiences in a book called WTF Just Happened?! There were many, but here are a few. (and people probably would believe me that I experienced them but might think I belonged in a mental hospital - LOL) 1 -

What is your biggest conspiracy theory?
Area 51.  Yes, I know, it’s the most basic of all basic conspiracy theories, but there’s a twist. Listen to me. Rumor has it that the very secretive military base in Nevada desert is a military installation at the Nellis Military Operations Area. But the base quickly became known as the most secretive military site in the world because it does not exist on any map or government website, leading many conspiracy theories.  Some think Area 51 is researching and experimenting on aliens and their spacecraft. More specifically, people think they are studying a crash that happened near Roswell, New Mexico, 

Egyptians, Mayans, Nubians, Aztecs etc did not build some of those magneficient structures with crude tools. Those structures were built using the most advanced technology of that time and were certaily not build in this ‘time frame’. Imagine 10000 years from now after a global "restart", the people of that time will marvel at the Palm Island(probably underwater by then) being just another Atlantis or how humans got help from aliens to build things like the Burj Khalifa, the Empire state building, the forbidden city etc., Like "how did those primitive beings learnt to build an edifice like this 

Before I answer the question I would like to confirm some things. There is a reason for this, is to make sure we are on the same page. First, what is a conspiracy? A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit an unlawful act or to accomplish a lawful end by unlawful means (https://www.britannica.com/topic/conspiracy). But I would also like to add that a crime is an action or activity that, although not illegal, is considered to be evil, shameful, or wrong. (https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/crime). I added this as I wanted to make sure we were clear on what I am about  

Id love to make this short but this is probably going to be quite lengthy in order to explain it efficiently enough. This is my conspiracy theory that I discovered after an awakening experience 3 years ago. Science and the theory of evolution is true but God itself actually exists as well, just not the way its been portrayed to us through religious scripture. The reason religious scripture has been altered is because if the truth were actually known, it would literally be the end of the world because people would see the system that god orchestrated and freewill to choose our beliefs would beco 

I have so many it’s hard to choose. I think the biggest one is just that the shadow government is doing its best to kill you. In America but really all over the world. How? The writing is on the wall concerning overpopulation. If anyone bothers to look down the road another 25 years you should be scared. The soils in America have been farmed out. Our food has very little nutrients compared to 100 years ago. Our FDA is just a stooge for big Pharma. The recommended daily vitamins and minerals are completely insufficient and wrong and they know it. They are counting on it. You will develop a deficie 

Justin Bieber does not exist! After you read my answer, you will definitely wonder how you never realised it before! Recently, one of my friends asked me if I had seen this particular TikTok video about Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber being twins. Her: Did you see that video about Miley and Justin being twins? Me: No… Her: I'll show you the video.  She showed me the video, and was laughing her ass off the whole time. But me? Bruh… I was shocked. If you can’t watch the video, it basically said something along the lines of: Justin Bieber is currently 25 years old and his biggest  

The world is full of mysteries yet to be discovered but I have a conspiracy theory regarding mythical creatures. Not these,   WARNING! Disturbing content ahead. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . But these,     These are what real mermaids and unicorns are like. They are hiding deep in the ocean, in the 95% of the ocean we didn’t discover. We also haven’t explore the depths of the forests… Or have we? My theory suggests that these creatures eat humans. Or maybe are scared of them. But for now let’s focus on the first point; According to Distractify over 16,000 people have gone missing on the Alaskan triangle.  But look clo 

I find it strange why liberal media never investigated China but jumped right into blaming President Trump for Coronavirus. its normal for journalist to investigate ground-zero, the start of pandemic yet they chose to only use this global crisis to attack United States President alone. There has been long standing ties between DNC and China both sharing socialist agendas (communist) unholy alliances.

 On 28th January 2021 Elon Musk's beloved girlfriend Claire Elise Boucher, professionally and popularly called Grimes, tweeted a poem.  For people unaware of Bitcoin's historical prices, this poem is referring to the fall in price of Bitcoin around that time. And, on 27th January 2021 Bitcoin had broke the historical level of $30,000 second time in a week.  $30,000 was a very important support level marked, projected, perceived and guessed by a lot of crypto experts and also retail investors. The reason these prices were catastrophic is that on January 8th, 2021 bitcoin had made an all time high of $ 

Going off of User-11033927607116841297’s answer, 9/11. Like… just taking a step back, removing all bias, it’s quite obvious that these towers didn’t fall from a plane crash. I could go into incredible detail, but I’ll just give a few basic ideas that should invoke questioning. Tower 7 wasn’t even touched but it fell.A skyscraper gets hit, wobbles, then (later) falls in it’s perfect footprint?

What do you believe in most?
Thank you for the A2A: I assume you mean spiritual beliefs, not like "I believe the Dodgers will win the NL West this year". I know you do, but thought I'd better put in my assumption. Well, I believe in a sort of Panetheism, which is like Pantheism (where everything is part of God or God is part of everything) except it says that everything IS god. We are all part of one large organism, and the spiritual biosphere - as it were - is always in balance with itself. As it is one thing you can't make it less than one, and therein is (in observation) where we get all our scientific laws. Within pane 

No one can break when ALLAAH has made it for you, and no one can make it if ALLAAH has not written it in your fate. Emotions are inevitable but staying down and low because of them is a choice. Nothing can beat knowledge. It opens up the mind. “Readers are leaders". This next thing is cultural. In my country, parents and managers and company owners have this mindset that they are not going to be recognized as such (per their status) until and unless they impose dominance. In my culture and I don't know what other culture, I have observed this culture in my neighboring countries as well, it is a “ 

I believe that if you want to make something happen, you must work super hard for it. You don’t sit around waiting for it to come to you, you must chase your dreams. You must let something consume you so much that you can’t think of anything. I believe in my family. I believe that if I go wrong and dug myself a grave, I’d always have a place to come back to. I believe that you can achieve anything if you set your mind to it. I believe that believing that we shall survive is what makes us survive. I believe that hope runs the world. I believe in the power of kindness. I believe that each of us, if 

I believe in MYSELF. I believe that I am the one who can make anything and everything happen, no one but I myself am the one who is worthy of creating my destiny, it is me who has the top authority to drive this life in top gear.I believe in HOPE. HOPE is the only thing that drives this world isn’t it?, don’t we wake up everyday with a new hope for so and so thing? don’t we sit there waiting for someone? don’t we work hard enough for our dreams, with this single thing known as hope, patronizing our determination?I believe in HIM. HE is the faith I have , HE resembles the divine in me, HE resemble

Now, I strongly believe that 1+1=2, but that’s neither satisfactory nor conclusive. It’s easy to believe something if either: a)It aligns with what you previously know, b)The idea of it is painless and pleasing in the short term, or c)Everyone else believes in it. I think I should answer with something that does not fall into the above categories if I truly want to know something about the person who looks me in the mirror. And that is why it is very, very difficult to find an answer to this question. There is one thing that I believe that would be difficult to support with my experiences, but  

It is a habit of mine to say “I don’t believe in belief.” Honestly, I think that is a pretty obnoxious thing to say to someone for whom their beliefs are a central part of their life and experience. I do respect other people’s beliefs, but I don’t use that word for myself. From my studies years ago I came to see the evolution of the structure of thought in human history. I learned about three historical “epics” characterized by mythical thinking, by religious thinking, and finally by scientific/philosophic thinking. Over the course of my life and career I have tried very hard to practice by thin 

I have a lot. Capitalism is the only economic system in that can help the poor. Anything other then it, it bad. Immigration is good when limited, and prioritizes those with good skills. Abortion is wrong, but it’s not as bad as bringing an unwanted child in the world. Gun control is not helpful, and those who want it are ignorant of guns in general, or how rare mass shootings really are. GMOs are one of the best ways to help people and the environment. Conservatism and Liberalism are both wrong. Whether there is a god or not is irrelevant to the human condition, and therefore, should not be focused o 

Kurt Cobain didn’t commit suicide. He was murdered.  Now before you think I’m crazy, hear me out. I’ve been a Nirvana fan for years. Kurt Cobain died before I was born on April 5th, 1994. He was an American singer and song-writer, in my opinion one of the best and most influential musicians of the century. He had an wife, Courtney Love, and an infant daughter, Frances Bean Cobain.  During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin addiction and chronic health problems such as depression. He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame, as well as his marriage to 

I have thought about this for several days, and finally realized that I cannot respond to the question as posed  because by asking "in most" it implies a single thing.  Things,and particularly intangible, conceptual things such as values or norms are intertwined.  Let's say that I believed in forgiveness. It would certainly imply compassion for the other person, since I am not about to thoughtlessly go around forgiving people or suggest that others do.  But, compassion implies empathy, being able to mentally and emotionally put yourself in the mind of the other person, otherwise compassion is

What is the most ridiculous thing that you have ever convinced someone to believe?
Okay, I have to tell this story because it is hilarious and it shows a couple of stereotypes about two different groups of people. When I was 21 (and had just turned 21), I took a job waiting tables at a restaurant in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, during a ski season. It was my first time traveling overseas by myself and I was obviously very excited. Now, when I eventually arrived, I discovered that the very famous hotel I was working at was not exactly a bustling metropolis - far from it, in fact. It was a 30 minute drive to a supermarket in any direction. However, I was the only foreigner work 

I convinced my friends I was fluent in a language that doesn't exist. Since I was really young, I've always been passionate about languages, both my own and others. I love grammar, reading, manipulating my words and syntax, and all that goodness. I've also always had a hyperactive imagination, and I am an avid europhile.  When I was in 7th grade, I created an imaginary country as a sort of "melting pot" of all the different Latin cultures found in Europe. Naturally it would need its own language, so I set to work creating a new romance language. I started by making a sort of "proto-romance", mix 

The Companion Cube Sometimes when I explain to new people I meet that I was born and spent some of my formative years in Soviet Russia (which is very much true), I bring up the Soviet tradition of the Weighted Companion Cube. The story I tell goes something like this:"Every Soviet child was assigned a Weighted Companion Cube, which functioned much like a teddy bear. We were encouraged to bring it along wherever we went, to socialize with it, and to confide in it our feelings and our deepest secrets. Naturally, it's quite likely that there were microphones hidden in at least some of them, maybe 

I have a friend named Whitney. As special as she is, she truly can be "special" when she wants to be. Whitney used to ask a lot of questions about whatever seemed to be on the top of her mind.  Before I tell you about the most ridiculous thing that I have ever convinced someone to believe, let me give you some background info on Whitney.

Many Hindus reject Allah's warning against associating partners with Allah in the belief that their gods will save them. How could Muslims convince Hindus of it being a grave sin thus help them to possibly avoid getting punished in hell for eternity?
The answer is quite long, see TL;DR; section at the bottom for short one. Let's answer the first part question first. Many Hindus reject Allah's warning against associating partners with Allah in the belief that their gods will save them. As a Muslim, can you mention ‘The name' of Allah, not His title or His quality. Like for example you are named ‘Ahmad’ not 'The most handsome man in the block’. (Sorry for any person named Ahmad, I borrow your name and not mean to offend you). Another example : Mr. Joko Widodo is the current president of Republic of Indonesia.

I was a Hindu, now an atheist, and I have spent considerable time studying Quran, Major Sunni Hadiths and Life of Mohammad. The reason why I rejected Islam is : The core concept of Islam is based on the creation story of Torah - which doesn’t make much sense.Belief in the Creation story is a pre requisite to be a true believer in Islam - since Quran claims Adam and Eve were the first humans it’s hard for people like me who believe in Evolution to believe in Islam.Most religions portray God as some megalomaniac with human qualities, Islam is no exception- it portrays god as someone who would puni

Question itself is hilarious and devoid of any sense. Allah for non muslims is not more than worth a piece of shit. Why would he or his warning matter? All religions are man made. They have good and bad things. Followers of dharmic religion accept the shortcomings and try to improve. For example Hinduism has gone under massive reforms and continuously evolving. On the other hand Abrahmic religion esp. Muslims are so much brain washed that they hardly able to understand the issue with Islam. Like a stagnant water Islam has become murky and stinky.

Hindus often disagree with Islam primarily because while addressing God Almighty as the Merciful, it does not actually portray Him as such. Their idea of God does not appear to be that of a kind Heavenly Father of the entire humanity but only an unrelenting and unforgiving monarch. Muslims portray God Almighty as someone related only to themselves. As if He has nothing do with the people of other religions whom He has created. A kind God does not burn people in permanent hell-fires, just because He is addressed and worshipped by a different name by different people. God was not born an Arab to  

Allah is supreme God. Surely, He must have some Energies/Powers? Or is He just a pile of rocks? Vaidik literature says these Energies/Powers of God are eternal, and are reposed in divine forms, i.e. they are personified. Thus, the ultimate, most important, and all-encompassing power of God, is represented by the Form of Radha, Seeta, etc. So, God doesn’t have an ordinary partner, who has captivated Him by her looks, etc. (Isn’t that why you are ashamed to think of Allah as having a partner?) But the same Personality - God - has assumed two Forms for the purpose of distributing bliss to the libe 

I think rather than worry that Hindus reject Allah, you guys should actually without unbiased emotions pay attention to what President Macron said in that “ Islam is in crisis”.

When so many killings are being done in the name of Islam, how do most of you respond ??? “Oh thats not Islam”. First go teach muslims on what is Islam.

Without Partner, Allah will always remain a Muslim Boss. He is literally a Muslim boss. None of the high ego Boss like any partner. They like servants and slaves. They like praising all the time. Prophet had appointed Allah in Islam so that he can force all Muslims for follow Quran, Sharia law, or force to follow prophets. Prophet ask all Muslims to praise Allah. Allah ask all Muslims to follow prophet. This is a loop. This organization works like this.

Do atheists believe that the laws of logic don’t apply to the classical arguments for the existence of God (ontological, cosmological)?
Rather, atheists (and many religious people as well) would use the laws of logic to critically examine the classical arguments for God. The classical ontological argument for God is summarised as such by Wikipedia: It is a conceptual truth (or, so to speak, true by definition) that God is a being than which none greater can be imagined (that is, the greatest possible being that can be imagined).God exists as an idea in the mind.A being that exists as an idea in the mind and in reality is, other things being equal, greater than a being that exists only as an idea in the mind.Thus, if God exists o

The problem with these arguments is that they smuggle in assumptions. Let's start with the Kalam Cosmological Argument: Whatever begins to exist has a cause.The Universe began to exist.Therefore, the Universe has a cause.This one falls apart right in the first line. How do we know that "Whatever begins to exist has a cause"? What have we ever observed beginning to exist to justify that it had a cause? I mean, on an everyday level, everything I interact with has existed since the start of the universe – the material has simply been rearranged. For example, if I take a sheet of paper and fold it i 

I can only speak for my self, so I will do just that. I’m perfectly happy with the laws of logic being applied to any argument. The problem I have with with the Ontological and Kalām Cosmological Argument is the attempt to seek in unsupported premises. Let us take the KCA. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.The universe began to exist.Therefore, the universe has a cause.That is the original argument. What can we say about that. Well if you accept 1 &amp; 2 then the conclusion would logically follow to be true. But I don’t even accept that 1 is true and we don’t know if the universe isn’t eternal in 

Q: Do atheists believe that the laws of logic don’t apply to the classical arguments for the existence of God (ontological, cosmological)? No, it’s just that we actually understand what the laws of logic actually are, especially the difference between a “valid” argument (i.e., where the premises, if true, lead to the conclusion) and one that is actually “sound” (i.e., where the premises are actually shown to be true and the argument is otherwise valid). We also understand that logical arguments that claim to be able to prove one thing (e.g., the existence of the God of Christianity) but actually 

One of the books that encouraged me to study philosophy at university was The Miracle of Theism, by J.L.Mackie. It takes the major arguments for and against the existence of God, including various attempts at the ontological and cosmological proofs, and gives them a decent philosophical review. It was exactly the careful application of logic and rigour to that analysis that I found so attractive. What the book does demonstrate, though, is that if you think that you can either prove or disprove the arguments with some sort of irrefutable, simple logical deduction, then you haven't thought hard en 

Logic can’t help arguments that merely use the form of logic without actually being logical. As one comment I read on Quora recently pointed out: if the ontological argument is valid, the perfect girlfriend really exists because girlfriends that exist are better than girlfriends that don’t, so if I can describe what I want in a perfect girlfriend, then that girlfriend necessarily exists. That’s basically the ontological argument on a nutshell, with some God-thing (whatever that is) replacing girlfriend. The cosmological argument basically demands that we name whatever came first God, presuming t 

Not this atheist. One of the problems with the “classical” arguments for the existence of God is that the premises are either invalid or unvalidated. You simply can’t prove the statements that lead to the conclusion, so you get a valid and logical conclusion that is “worth” exactly what the invalid or unvalidated premises are “worth” and “proves” exactly what the invalid or unvalidated premises set up. Another problem is that these “classical” arguments for the existence of God can equally “prove” every god ever imagined. Or, as Diderot said of Pascal’s Wager “an Imam could reason the same way”. 

Original Question: Do atheists believe that the laws of logic don’t apply to the classical arguments for the existence of God (ontological, cosmological)? Logic only works on things which exist and which are demonstrably logical. Logical or ontological arguments to try to prove the existence of a god, no matter how complex those arguments might be, can never actually prove the existence of anything for which there is no observable evidence. Claims such as "God exists because the Bible says so", "the Bible is the word of God" and "Nature exists, therefore, it must have been created, and God is the 

Q: Do atheists believe that the laws of logic don’t apply to the classical arguments for the existence of God (ontological, cosmological)? A: No, atheism is not a belief. Any question that starts with “do atheists believe…?”, demonstrates the ignorance of the asker. There are no logical arguments that don't rely exclusively upon the presupposition of the believer's god's existence, and the nonexistence of all the gods that believer rejects as false. It's hypocrisy to demand disproof of your god or gods, without first disproving all the gods you don't believe in. The only logical position is to with 

Atheists have only one thing in common, they do not accept the existence of gods. We have told you this thousands of times so why do you persist in trying to attribute other common ideas to all atheists? I have no doubt there are many different views on logic amongst different atheists, however the majority are quite happy to accept that the laws of logic apply to the matter. Those arguments you state are however simply not logical. The laws of logic contradict and disprove both ontologically and cosmological attempts at arguing for the existence of God, so it is you who don't accept the laws of 

Why do theists reject the idea that the materials which create the universe always existed but insist that their god always existed?

Hello, Chris Ferguson! Q: Is the cosmological argument really a good and reasonable defense for the existence of God? Not at all, despite how many times it gets used by Christian and non-Christian religious apologists. It suffers from two main flaws: The premises, while possibly true, are not necessarily true, and therefore the conclusion is not necessarily true and proves precisely nothing.The actual conclusion reached by the argument is merely “the universe had a cause” and does not provide any logical basis for declaring that this “cause” must be an intelligent being of some sort (let alone th

No. It is very flawed and the flaws have been known for hundreds of years.

 Brandon Harper 1h ago No, none of the arguments is qualitatively better, because all of them suffer from the same fatal flaw. All of them suffer from misattribution of property without foundation.Specifically, they all baselessly depend upon being able to extrapolate the rules within our existing universe that necessitate cause and effect to statements of premise without our existing universe.This fatal flaw cripples all such arguments as soon as one attempts to pragmatically apply the argument Response: that was some gay sounding shit that just came out of your mouth right there, left brainer th 

No, it’s not. First of all, it makes the claim that the Universe must have been created. We don’t know whether it was created or not. We don’t even know whether it had a beginning. Generally, the same people who make claims along the lines of “everything requires a cause”, or that everything has a creator, when asked about the hypothetical “god” which this argument purportedly “proves”, will turn right around and say that their god has not been created! So they, themselves, don’t really believe that everything has a cause! And of course, if you can make a “special exception” for a god, you can j 

The cosmological argument is not a good argument for God. Even the minimal form of the argument, which only concludes that the universe has a cause, is fraught with problems and is not enough to epistemically justify even its modest conclusion. What makes it even worse, though, is how much of a gap is left between “the universe has a cause" and “God exists.” There are infinitely many possible causes for the universe, and infinitely many of them are better explanations for the universe than God would be. Even if we grant the conclusion to the Cosmological argument, there is no way to reasonably m 

No it is not good or reasonable. It always uses At Least the “God of the gap fallacy” It is based on assumptions in order to try and prove the existence of a higher being or first cause. And in the end there is almost always a huge jump in conclusions from “therefore it must be a creator/first cause” to “And it must be a God” and then the even bigger jump to “And that god is Of COURSE the god i happens to believe in” And no there is not really any better argument.

Does God save only by His sovereign will?
Q). Does God save only by his sovereign will? A). This is one of those frustrating “Yes and No” or “Both-And” sort of answers. There are bible verses that speak in very clear sounding ways about God choosing whom He will save. And there are very clear verses about us choosing to submit to and trust in God. “Mystery” has to do with paradoxes - mutually exclusive truths that are nevertheless both true. Sometimes “mystery” is used too easily to shut down argument. But his is a correct application of that term.

Before plunging right into this a definition and some background is needed. Definition: “Saved.” Meaning saved from the Fall of Adam, wherein death came into the world. Also meaning saved from individual sins, depending on keeping the laws Christ established for this salvation. (Acts 2:38 and Acts 22:16 and many others.) Background: Before God created the earth he had His family of spirit children. As God, Himself, was a resurrected immortal being, not subject to death and having a “brightness of glory” He wanted the same for His children. So He created a plan which involved all of them (who wou 

The question suggests “theological determinism,” [1] that God decrees who will be saved or damned without any meaningful impact of their own free choice. May I suggest Molinism[2], a reasonable principle with biblical examples that upholds both God’s sovereignty and man’s free will. In the Molinism worldview, God has knowledge not only of truths, but also of counterfactuals (God’s middle knowledge). A counterfactual statement is, “If Peter’s watching TV he’ll prefer The Simpsons over Family Guy. Even if Peter never watches TV, God still knows whether Peter would watch The Simpsons or Family Guy.” Go 

God OFFERS salvation by His sovereign will alone— and He willed it at first, once, in the garden of Eden when Adam and Eve sinned, and at least one more time when He rescued Noah and His family. He did not have to continue with the human race at all under either of these circumstances. He could have just said, “Noah, c’mon up here,” and that would have been the end of the rest of civilization. But instead He chose to die for us so we who were subsequently born could live forever. in both of these cases, Jesus confirmed that He would come in the flesh to endure the cross.

The Bible is clear that God is sovereign in salvation. Not only did He predestine certain ones to salvation (Ephesians 1), but it ensures us that salvation is based on God’s choice. It’s not based at all on the will or obedience of the person. Romans 9:15–16: For He saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.

The Bible reports Jesus as saying, "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them." and "No one comes to the Father except through Me."  So no one is able to come to know God unless they are called by Him. But here's the good news: God calls everyone.   That "calling" is an internal pull that compells us to seek Him. This feels like your soul is drawn to him like a swimmer draws water with the hand. He will pull you and guide you into the presence of one Elijah-type figure. Someone who calls himself a pastor.

One could put it like that. One is saved by dying in a state of grace, free from any mortal sin, as that is His Will. If you want to know more about mortal sin, I will leave this here: What is a Mortal Sin?What is a Mortal Sin? "Amen, amen, I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not
see death forever." John 8:51 The Distinction between two types of sin All sin is an offense against God and a rejection of his perfect
love and justice. Yet, Jesus makes a distinction between two types of sins. We call the
most serious and grave sins, mortal sins. Mortal sins destroy the grace of God in the
heart of the sinner. By their very grave nature, a mortal sin cuts our relationship off
from God and turns man away from his creator. St. Pauls letter to the Hebrews tell
us that "if we sin willfully after having the knowledge of the truth, there is now
left no sacrifice for sins" (Hebrews 10:26). The second type of sin, venial sin, that
of less grave matter, does not cut us off from Christ. However, venial sin does weaken
grace in the soul and damages our relationship with God. A person who frequently indulges
in venial sin is very likely to collapse into mortal sin if they persist in their evil
ways. So what kind of Sins are Mortal? In order for a sin to be mortal, it must meet three conditions: Mortal sin is a sin of grave matter Mortal sin is committed with full knowledge of the sinner Mortal sin is committed with deliberate consent of the sinner This means that mortal sins cannot be done "accidentally."
A person who commits a mortal sin is one who knows that their sin is wrong, but still
deliberately commits the sin anyway. This means that mortal sins are
"premeditated" by the sinner and thus are truly a rejection of Gods law
and love. The first condition, that a mortal sin is of grave matter, means
that certain premeditated offenses against God are more severe than others. We know that
some sins are graver than others (e.g. it is a graver sin to murder someone than to lie to
someone). St. John tells us, "If anyone sees his brother sinning, if the sin is not
deadly, he should pray to God and he will give him life. This is only for those whose sin
is not deadly. There is such a thing as deadly sin, about which I do not say that you
should pray. All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not deadly." (1 John
5:16-17). Thus St. John distinguishes between mortal and venial sin. Jesus also warns us
that "Anyone who does not remain in me will be thrown out like a branch and wither;
people will gather them and throw them into a fire and they will be burned" (John
15:6). What kinds of offenses against God constitute "grave matter"? In the Bible, St. Paul gives us a list of grave sins. He
states that anyone who commits these sins shall not enter the kingdom of God. "Now
the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness,

So you may be referring to the Kalam cosmological argument—as usually presented by William Lane Craig. But even WLC had to re-jigger the argument some time back to cover one of its major flaws. This is fine, and fair—to a point—but it does point out how illogical the argument was for so long on a single point—one that even WLC could see—once it was pointed out to him. But even the re-jiggered ve 

Hello, Chris Ferguson! Q: Is the cosmological argument really a good and reasonable defense for the existence of God? Not at all, despite how many times it gets used by Christian and non-Christian religious apologists. It suffers from two main flaws: The premises, while possibly true, are not necessarily true, and therefore the conclusion is not necessarily true and proves precisely nothing.The actual conclusion reached by the argument is merely “the universe had a cause” and does not provide any logical basis for declaring that this “cause” must be an intelligent being of some sort (let alone th

No. It is very flawed and the flaws have been known for hundreds of years. One of the problems with the “classical” arguments for the existence of God is that the premises are either invalid or unvalidated. You simply can’t prove the statements that lead to the conclusion, so you get a valid and logical conclusion that is “worth” exactly what the invalid or unvalidated premises are “worth” and “proves” exactly what the invalid or unvalidated premises set up. Another problem is that these “classical” arguments for the existence of God can equally “prove” every god ever imagined. Or, as Diderot sa 

 Brandon Harper 1h ago No, none of the arguments is qualitatively better, because all of them suffer from the same fatal flaw. All of them suffer from misattribution of property without foundation.Specifically, they all baselessly depend upon being able to extrapolate the rules within our existing universe that necessitate cause and effect to statements of premise without our existing universe.This fatal flaw cripples all such arguments as soon as one attempts to pragmatically apply the argument Response: that was some gay sounding shit that just came out of your mouth right there, left brainer th 

No, it’s not. First of all, it makes the claim that the Universe must have been created. We don’t know whether it was created or not. We don’t even know whether it had a beginning. Generally, the same people who make claims along the lines of “everything requires a cause”, or that everything has a creator, when asked about the hypothetical “god” which this argument purportedly “proves”, will turn right around and say that their god has not been created! So they, themselves, don’t really believe that everything has a cause! And of course, if you can make a “special exception” for a god, you can j 

The cosmological argument is not a good argument for God. Even the minimal form of the argument, which only concludes that the universe has a cause, is fraught with problems and is not enough to epistemically justify even its modest conclusion. What makes it even worse, though, is how much of a gap is left between “the universe has a cause" and “God exists.” There are infinitely many possible causes for the universe, and infinitely many of them are better explanations for the universe than God would be. Even if we grant the conclusion to the Cosmological argument, there is no way to reasonably m 

No it is not good or reasonable. It always uses At Least the “God of the gap fallacy” It is based on assumptions in order to try and prove the existence of a higher being or first cause. And in the end there is almost always a huge jump in conclusions from “therefore it must be a creator/first cause” to “And it must be a God” and then the even bigger jump to “And that god is Of COURSE the god i happens to believe in” And no there is not really any better argument.

How can I become charismatic?
There is a lot of mystique surrounding Charisma. This benefits the people that already 'just get it', making having charisma more rare and more valuable. Most charismatic people were lucky by having the right social experiences throughout their live that taught them to behave in ways that are inherently socially liked. Charisma isn't indescribable or inborn like many like to believe. Charisma starts with your mental and physical expression towards the outside world. Human beings are superficial. Physical attractiveness matters a lot in our social interactions which is why it's important to look 

That’s an intriguing question! And to a certain extent, you have answered your own question! :) I do observe such behavior and question (myself) what they did or am doing to make themselves more attractive. Most of the time my conclusion boils down to one word. CONFIDENCE This is a word which we have been telling ourselves repeatedly since we are young; before we go to the stage to deliver our graduation speech, before we walk up to the person we like to express our affection, before we enter that interview room for our job application and etc, you get the gist. However, if we were confident, we k 

I’d say these are the most desirable elements of charisma. The guts to make the ballsy move, even when you’re unsure about it working.The ability to speak loudly and freely without filtering yourself.The self-esteem to believe you deserve the hottie in the cocktail dress.I honestly believe you’re like 90% of the way to your dream partner (and maybe your dream life) once you’ve got these skills down. Here are 10 exercises I recommend to help you learn these skills. #1 Grab a pen and write 50 reasons why you’re awesome  Grab a pen and write down 50 reasons. Fifty might soun 

If you aren’t charismatic you probably never will be. My public speaking consultants encouraged us to stay within our personality type and to use our natural strengths. I, for example, was not charismatic or an instantly likeable type. The instructors, however noted two strengths as I spoke. One was that I came across as very honest and trustworthy. They verified this with audience feedback. The other was that I spoke with above average clarity. Again, verified with audience feedback. I had a gift for explaining something complicated so that everyone was able to understand it. They also noted a 

If you’ve ever met someone likable, yet you couldn’t explain specifically why you like them, that means they have charisma. You can learn to be charismatic too, and all it takes is some modifications to your behavior. Charisma is about what you say and do as opposed to who you really are as a person. Your subconscious, social cues, physical expression and the way you treat others all play a part in developing your charisma. “Presence” is the most important aspect of charisma, with confidence being a close second. Presence is all about being truly engaged with others. Essentially, you’re showing 

Let’s first make the difference of being ‘cocky’ and having charisma. Cocky people are the in your face, over confident, self opinionated, over opinionated and under experienced. You will have come across many in middle management positions. They were appointed because the interviewer mistook their confidence as super positive and infectious. This type get by in life contributing little but taking a lot. Your hard work will always support their existence because they are basically lazy. They will never lead by example, but delegate responsibilities. Their lack of experience and knowledge means 

Counterintuitively, charisma can come from embracing yourself for the excellent person you already are. More often than not efforts to attain that mythical goal of charisma are efforts to achieve some other end, perhaps procuring attention of all sorts via a magnetic personality.  Rather than attempting to achieve that goal, think of it as what would it take for you to be happy and unrestrained.  If you behave in a way that secures your own happiness while respecting others sufficiently you're one step closer to achieving your goals. Ironically those who focus on enjoying themselves are often actu 

 What do we look for in others? What is the thing that makes us like someone? What makes some people seem to gravitate around others? How are those people different from the rest? Charisma is a way to describe this general sensation. It’s the pull a person has towards others, like the gravitational force of a planet they just seem to pull people in. Why? And what makes that person so charismatic? And how do we become more charismatic?  #1 - Stability Life is like a raging river. It throws us for loops, gives us no stability at all, and the twists, turns, and rocks along the way can sink our little dingy  

I was struggling as a writer. I wanted to write a book but there was nothing to inspire me, so I thought. I said that to my friend who is a writer too. I said, “I wish I was charismatic, someone who just attracted the ideas, the attention of the right people, resources and just made things happen.” That’s when he shared something valuable with me. “It’s called 360 degrees.”“What is it?”“You turn your life around completelly and you become charismatic. You won’t have this problem with writing, meeting influential people, attract attention and mostly whatever you want. There’s only 3 steps, that’s 

“Being present — paying attention to what’s going on rather than being caught up in your thoughts — can yield immense rewards. When you exhibit presence, those around you feel listened to, respected, and valued.” ― Olivia Fox Cabane Charisma is Learnable As an introvert, I need my alone time to recharge and recuperate. Although I enjoy attending social settings, being around others can be draining. Growing up, I was always shy. During class, I would be afraid to speak up and express my honest thoughts. And I would only participate in group discussions when the teachers called on me.  And during those

Hello Sean, Here are three stories about three men. Quintus son of Claudia Once upon a time there was this woman called Claudia who had made the mistake of joining a cult when she was young, she left that cult when she realised her mistake. She then got into a relationship with a guy. That relationship ended up in divorce. She got four kids before the relationship ended upon the rocks. The first story is about one of her sons. This son Quintus was a little slow in understanding the mindset of others. Quintus could be a little naive at times. Kids of his age sometimes preyed on his naviety. He was  

It's winter, and you are walking down the pavement. You're carrying two bags of shopping, quietly thinking about one trivial matter or another. You pause for a second at the sight of a small bird, but ultimately pay it little attention. Around the corner you go, following a route so familiar it's as if your body is on autopilot. You drop your head down a little as the cold wind hits your face. Cross the road, looking both ways, stepping up onto the curb… Ten seconds. You slip. A small patch of ice. You fly forward and find yourself bent over, something holding you up by your chest. You try to st 

Richard Feynman, the noble prize winning American theoretical physicist, once wrote something that is definitely going to change how you see the world:  I have a friend who’s an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don’t agree with very well. He’ll hold up a flower and say “look how beautiful it is,” and I’ll agree. Then he says “I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,” and I think that he’s kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe… I can apprecia 

Pretty much everything with the world right now. It may or may not change the way you see the world, but this is what shake me up everytime I realise that no matter what type of democarcy and freedom you think you live in, YOU ARE A SLAVE. You are a slave of government and thus the entire system. Government rules the media and media rules us. It feeds us with the false information or information that has nothing to do with our lives.

I can try… but I think the answer is almost certainly not. I don’t believe that is how it works. Nor would I really want to because it’ll almost certainly be for the worse on your end. I can make a point, it can be beautifully written and/or intensely detailed, it can even be emotive or fascinating or very spiritually inclined but will it change how you see the world? Unlikely. Because everything we see and hear and think, everything we experience or process, gets filtered through a cognitive bias… perhaps it is wishful and optimistic thinking or spiritual beliefs, religion, racism, cultural jib 

Last week I visited Chichen-Itzá, named a UNESCO World Heritage Site and in 2007 voted as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.  This archeological treasure is found in the state of Yucatan, Mexico, very near the famous tourist area of Cancun. It’s estimated that over 2.6 million people visited the Chichen-Itzá in 2017… it’s a very busy place! I found people from all over the world, many from Europe and USA, all of them with plenty of money to buy anything. Everything in Mexico feels cheap for them because of the purchase power of their currency. Now, to answer your question, “Can you write s 

Reality as you know it doesn’t exist. It just exists on your mind because you have been influenced by other people with their own realities on their minds… This has been happening for thousands of years, and the idea that we have of reality has been corrupted to the point we all think what we see is what we get, and we react to that as if we didn’t have another choice. We believe in luck, destiny, we believe we do not control our own lives, we have come to assume what happens in our daily lives is made by others and we just have to deal with it.

Yes, I can write something that will fundamentally change how you see the world. Most people believe their thinking, feelings, and behavior are the product of their learning, culture, and intellect. Most people believe their culture and politics are mainly based on the combined thinking of many people over time, and nothing else. However, our thinking and behavior is not only controlled by our intellect, but it is also controlled by a second mechanism in our brain: biological programming, which interacts with our intellect. Every human is born with a brain that is hardwired for certain things. Th

Back in our tree-climbing days, the pinky used to be much bigger and was essential for grip on trees.

The pinky lost its significance and shrunk in size, and is now just a stubble.  2. Spread your hands wide. Notice the webby skin between your fingers?

What is the difference between an intelligent person and a wise person?
Difference between intelligence and wisdom Acquired intelligence is none other than the knowledge, skill or ability you have in a specialized area. Human intelligence is the ability to think in a rational manner, interpret things in your environment and execute actions based on your thoughts as a human being. Innate intelligence is your natural born abilities (talents). Note that sometimes it's difficult to distinguish between acquired and innate abilities. We may not know what our innate abilities are until we try our hand at different things, hobbies, occupations, sports etc. Just like acquire 

Intelligence is a knife.Wit is an ice pick.Wit requires finesse with language, a sense of humor, and probably irony. You can be very smart but rather humorless and tongue-tied.  A nuanced sense of irony also might not be a necessary strong trait for a career as a physicist. In fact being adept with a turn of a phrase is not a requirement for many careers that nevertheless require a high degree of intelligence.  But it might be for, say, the profession of political speech-writer. As with the tired-out truism that demonstrates that although all four legged animals are not dogs, a dog is indeed a

''Wisdom is a virtue, intelligence is a trait'' The difference between being wise and being intelligent is that wisdom is so much more than intelligence. As we all know, intelligent people can become wise, if they truly want to. All they have to do is to make a few changes in their behavior and knowledge and put in some effort. So, here are the differences between wise and smart people.  Talking and Listening Wise people tend to pay more attention to what others have to say and add comments occasionally whilst intelligent people like talking in order to express their opinions, views, and ideas.

What is the difference between an intelligent person and a wise person? Wise - the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment. Intelligence - a person with the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. One of the chief reasons for studying Adam Smith is to have a working idea of “the system”. All good students of Smith know the system is more than simply government or legislative, judicial, and executive powers. It is impossible to list all the powers included in the system but a good working list of the chief powers would be the following: Government proper. Corporations as they scratc 

“Honey, I got my hair done today, look at my new fringes!” Your wife says, running her fingers through her hair looking in the mirror. Your intelligence tells you that as a matter of fact, your wife’s new hair style isn’t as good as her last one. Your wisdom will tell you to keep your mouth shut. Let’s take a look at it in a broader manner: Intelligent people tend to process information in a logical way, whereas wise people process not just the logic, but the emotional, the spiritual, and the subtle side of the logic as well. This could be crucial at times when dealing with situations faced in pr

Intelligence is solving problems, making observations, learning, and being aware of your surroundings. Wisdom is being aware of the self, knowing right from wrong, morality, avoiding mistakes, predicting the future, and being strong. Wise people are more likely to be happy. They are balanced, resourceful, and good friends. Intelligent people may be happy but they may not be. They read, relate, listen, and think but they may be evil. From the Buddhist perspective wisdom is the ideal virtue. All virtues are just a type of wisdom including intelligence. Wisdom also includes kindness, courage, and s

Hello Abhishek! Thanks for the A2A. Intelligence is an ability to function appropriately in everyday life i.e. a basic capacity to deal with situations. In everyday life, people term someone who performs well in examinations, or who has some creative ideas for business, or who has a quick solution to a problem as ‘intelligent’. This is actually an abuse of the term, for in reality, even someone who does not really stand out, but manages to deal adequately with his life is intelligent. Intelligence is largely genetic, with most people showing an average intelligence from birth, while a few showi

Are you insane if most of society seems insane to you?
Imagine this: I time travel to the past from today (2019) to way back in the day perhaps to the 7th century. Since I live in the Arabian peninsula, this is what I might wake up to:  I wake up as a concubine and someone yells at me to head to the clan leader's tent naked. I enter and there are seven naked women with me. I see the big hairy man pleasuring himself with a helpless concubine, pulling her hair and beating her up. She looks like she is not enjoying this in the slightest. I shout, “What are you doing, old man?! This is rape! Can't you see that she's suffering?” He glares at me and grabs me  

Several years ago, I came across a quote that stopped me in my tracks. I found myself at the beginning of a journey, a total transformation, and I began questioning everything I once accepted, and everything I was still seeing right in front of me. I began to realize that common did not equal normal. I began to see that society had a backwards moral compass, yet was always in forward motion - not because of noteworthy ambition, but due to an inability to pause and stop and reflect. Society was fracturing, and I found myself beginning to remove myself from it, as I began to fracture as well. So m 

I would ask you to extend on this question. Once subject matter is put in place or even and example of the insanity you see or feel then it becomes more relative. If you preceive life differently and are still positive, happy and are not anti social in society or towards it (at a high end of that spectrum) then no your not insane. Sort of like innocent until proven guilty as long as you remember though, being righteous and judging people based on your preception that contradiction would condemn yourself.(trying to prove the innocent guilty in that metaphor) Rather listen to there points of vie

No, what determines if someone is insane or not is how their psyche is holding together. Someone can see the insane parts of society, but remain calm and collected, and try to focus on addressing each problem to resolve them one at a time. Then they are not insane, but are just attempting to help an insane world to get back on track. Michael Horn, an author for the blog They Fly, is a good example of someone who writes about our insane world but keeps a level, logical head. But if someone sees the insane parts of society, but in turn they lose the integrity of their psyche and go out in a berser 

I don't know if I'll be called insane but most of society seems insane to me.. What a society means?? A group of individual living together in a family or individual shares a common value that is humanity. Society doesn't form with religion,neither with animals or neither with the base of any gender. Society forms with humans with human values. But in today's society if you look around nothing called humanity find in common.If something common you find you see people are fighting with each other for religion,weaks are fighting for their right over strong,females are fighting for their security .No  

Possibly. Then again… Sanity is not defined by culture. Sanity is an appraisal of a person’s mental state. A human who kills other humans is not necessarily insane even if that human is a serial killer. A killer would be considered insane if he/she liked to skin the victims, wear their skin as a robe and the intestines as a chain while humming and dancing to I’m A Little Teapot for personal gratification at the urge of untamable thoughts thrown up by the subconscious of the type “Let’s go kill and masturbate into the blood while covered in our lover’s skin.” Notice that thought includes ‘our’ a 

Before there can be an answer to this question we have to define what inanity really is? Every person in the world has different boundaries, different limits of you want as to how far they'd go in a certain situation. With that in mind the question stated doesn't address which society we are talking about, whether that would be western, eastern, middle Eastern? What about religion maybe social differences. So are you insane if most of society seems insane to you? No most likely you're not you have a different view of the world and you see things with a different tint than most people. Unless you  

Probably. I think that killing is wrong but 99% of society disagrees. Governments have assassins and wage illegal wars over resources they don’t have the social skills to negotiate deals for. Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior - Wikipedia Iraq War - Wikipedia Obviously I’m a barbarian for not enjoying killing like good-to-honest “normal” folk do. I also think it’s important to survive. 46% of Americans think I’m crazy to want to survive. They’re happy to sit back and watch the planet burn and they don’t even have the decency to acknowledge that it’s happening. I mean, what kind of idiot wants to live?  

What does it feel like to have OCD?
As someone that has been diagnosed with OCD I can speak to the experience of knowing and dealing with it. But I think it is worth setting context around what OCD is first. With that context I think it is easier to understand what it's like having OCD.  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is when someone has unwanted and repeated thoughts, feelings, ideas, sensations (obsessions), or behaviors that make them feel compelled to do something (compulsions). Often the obsessive thoughts are not rational yet are not easily controllable and the compulsions usually give the person momentary relief from the an 

It's irritating and frustrating. You can't avoid the stimuli of so many things that are "wrong" about the world. It's like a thousand little pinches that, together, make your life very unconfortable. For instance, when you enter into a room your attention is automatically drawn to a lot of misaligned objects. Your focus is always shared with things that don't really matter but are, for you, "important". The side effect is we always want the cleanest environments, the cleanest designs, the simpler the better. But people also like that, what is the difference? The difference is: it's almost as it's 

Let’s imagine I’m home with just my little sister. She has already gone to bed, and I’m just about to. My parents and brother are on vacation, and I’ve just finished talking to my mom on the phone. After I finish locking the front door, I walk up the stairs, grabbing the bannister after each step, making sure my thumb and index finger meet point-to-point and at the same time, lie flat against the surface of the wood so there is no space for air. I stop at the landing, the odd stair out of the set. Here, I crouch down, and starting at the infinitely small point where the two adjacent walls meet t 

The daily experience can widely vary because there are many types of OCD. The most common type we hear about is the one where people have obsessions about contamination, but there are many others. While the obsessions and compulsions are widely different among people, the core disorder is the same.  So the answer to your question is that it depends on the type, but it almost certainly consists of a constant and unstoppable cycle of obsessions and compulsions.  First come the obsessions. These are thoughts that permeate your consciousness, causing a great deal of anxiety. For me, these were words 

It feels as if you are constantly on a mental high wire juggling hand grenades. My OCD primarily manifests itself entirely mentally, so my compulsions are usually in my head. The complex system of obsession, anxiety, and compulsion can, on its worst days, make it almost impossible for me to focus on anything other than the cycle of OCD in my head. At its absolute worst, I was unable to sleep, read, do my homework, or even carry on complex conversation, and it was the only time in my life I have ever wanted to die.  I was diagnosed when I was 12, but my symptoms actually began much earlier, when 

Well, I have had those obsessive thoughts, but thoughts eventually affect behavior, so “pure O” really is not pure. Well, my friend had really bad OCD that started out that way. She had “contamination” type OCD. She felt like everything was contaminated. So because of this obsession she had to start controlling her environment in an attempt to control the obsessive thinking. So she controlled herself and then she controlled others and you had to remove your shoes before you could come in her house (good idea actually) but it gradually went further and further until she was washing her hands over 

HiI began experiencing OCD symptoms when I was 17. Its been four years and my condition is somewhat stable, though there are bad days. I think the following points will give you an idea as to what OCD is and how it feels being the one experiencing it. • The major point is that ocd sufferers are fighting a battle. Constantly. Every passing moment. And that battle is against their own brain. Yes, psychological disorders are the disorders in which the brain is not on our side. And its not easy to defeat the brain. • OCD sufferers experience irrational/silly/stupid, repetitive thoughts which cause  

I don't really know where to begin because my personal experience and understanding of OCD seems to be way too voluminous to make a precis out of it. Nevertheless, I’d like to make an honest effort in sharing it with everyone. My Own Experience Initially, like most people (I guess), I was hardly aware of the fact that I had a pathological disorder. But quite often, I used to experience an uncanny type of obsessive inquisitiveness and skepticism followed by weird compulsions ever since I was young. For example, after having finished with an examination, I used to feel at a complete loss trying

I am obsessed with OCD (pun intended). I find it incredibly fascinating. And it’s one of the main reasons I chose to go into my profession as a Cognitive Behavioural Coach. I have seen countless patients who suffer from OCD. I even made a specific Add On (The Power of Iron Will) in my app, Captain Calm about it. I have seen how the tools and techniques in it have myself and first-hand in myself and my clients to understand and overcome OCD. But I’m not here to talk about Captain Calm. Right now, I want to tell you my personal story of what it feels like to have OCD and, more importantly, ho 

It's scary. It encloses to a circle of thoughts you wholeheartedly KNOW you cannot get out of. OCD isn't only about being obsessed with hygeine , it's about any thoughts recurring in your mind over and over again without any periodic rests in between. It will grasp your mind, the recurring thoughts will take over you conpletely and control your every thought process. Anything you think about will be linked to the chain of thoughts you are obsessively thinking about and you cannot control them.  When you begin to distract yourself, the chain of thoughts displace into your subconscious part of th

They might go for a long walk, travel to foreign countries alone. Downtime - This theme is commonly discussed around introversion community. Downtime, is obviously some time dedicated for doing merely stuff we really enj 

the reasons can be categorized into 3 categories. ( I would answer in the concept, why would someone become a “loner”) 1)people who lack social skillswhile people who have bad social skill can also make friends and relationships. they’re very prone to end up alone or to stay alone for a long while.they’re not good at maintaining friendships/relationships and obviously starting them. this is the first level. people who can’t attract others. not good at first impressions.usually, people who are autistic/Aspergers or were raised in specific environments, making their mindsets a specific way and 

I like to live alone. Why? Because: I am an introvert and living alone keeps me charged for interactions.I like to keep my surroundings clean. More people= more mess and most people don’t even get bothered.Cuz I am too much in love with doing things my way, be it cooking or dressing up or doing any of the household chores. I hate when people tell me to do a certain thing in a certain way. Bitch, I didn’t ask you so shut up!I offend people. I am better left alone cuz I can be a real pain in the ass sometimes.I like to be naked sometimes. I hate to get dressed up in the bathroom and then come out

I have read about and experienced Loneliness. Loneliness is a Sense of Fragmentation, an Alienation from Part of the World, often resulting in blinker vision, tunnel vision, the black plague as Camus called it..sometimes its worse when Midlife Crisis meets Loneliness…we feel a degree of Separation..of Alone ness ..it is a normal reaction also after a sudden death..or unexpected divorce, firing, outsourcing to say it politely…it can undermine our Sense of Self of Worth, Self Confidence…we need to Heal from it, …it requires addressing the Part of you with that Hurt and Meeting their Needs,,its fix 

The last time I was in a relationship was about a year and a half ago. We broke up because, although we love each other and remain close, we are irreconcilably incompatible. Living together represented years of relentless friction that exhausted us. Over the last couple of years of our seven year relationship I fantasized about having my own space. I wanted more than anything to live alone without having to push against anyone to express my preferences, the way I wanted to live, and, ultimately, who I was. After we broke up I did move into my own place, which was painful and lonely and felt like t 

Well, It's really how he/she perceives the world. As for me “I just love peace” And to some extent it's an intelligent descision and provides more meaningful connections and memories. For now I have some key points for you to note as to why alone is better. But this has it's own list of cons. You are away from all the bullshit the world has to offer. Yes, gossip, backbitching is far to common than you'll realise. And trust me every one is a hungry wolf nowadays. So let them cut one another out. “I love to be the spectator” to their little gameYou have more time to yourself: Now, this is fabulous.

I can only tell you why I like to live alone. First of all, I’m an introvert and am quickly depleted by being around others. The constant noise and stimulation wears me out, and gets on my last nerve. When I start getting this way and am unable to get away, I get very crabby and short-tempered. When I was married, twice, I was always trying to find a place to be alone, away from the incessant drone of the television that my husbands turned on the moment they arose, and didn’t turn off until they finally went to bed. It was like fingernails down a blackboard for me. That’s when I started taking

Let me tell my reasons for living alone But before that, I’m an extrovert !! So how is it that I like to live alone more despite being an extrovert ?? I do have a lot of friends no doubt . A lot of people do say so too. But in reality they’re only people I know! I don’t keep people really close to me . Some come some go. So my friends usually talk about their shit or us talking about kpop or anime in general or we do gossip. Well gossiping is something which is not worth to hear and I don’t wanna gossip but , I’m still involved in their talk. So hearing stuff like" This girl is a big hoe , she s

It can only be said that everyone has become more and more mature and stable. They don’t like to get together for some meaningless social interactions like before, and when a person matures, they will also like to be alone more and more, because of this Only when we are young can we settle down and do a good job. Maybe when we were young, we felt that everyone liked to hang out together. When we grow up, we gradually dislike the crowded environment, including gatherings with relatives, so we say this phenomenon It is normal.  Many people may find that in the past, everyone liked to gather for di

Scenario:  I am working in the IT sector. In my last company I made some blunder. My manager got furious. He called me in the meeting room and started bashing me like anything. He was literally shouting at me. Whatever happened wasn't just my fault. My other teammate was also involved in it. He was senior to me and on his suggestions I made some changes which corrupted some functionalities of the system. I was a fresher and it's been just 6 months I had joined the company. Any normal person and so I, had three options. Explain my manager that it wasn't just my fault. Other person was also involved. T

1. HOW DO I GET MORE INFORMATION OUT OF SOMEONE? You asked someone something but the other person is not very forthcoming with their answer, just keep eye contact and stay quiet. More often than not, you will get the other person to spill more beans and it will eliminate any awkwardness. 2. HOW CAN I MAKE MYSELF FEEL CONFIDENT IN AN INSTANT? The short answer is to take up as much space as you can with your arms and legs. A good example of this is the “power stance”, adopted by rockers such as James Hetfield of Metallica and Freddie Mercury of Queen. After just a couple of minutes, testosterone wi 

Here are 12 tricks I learned from the book ‘12 rules for life an antidote to chaos’, written by psychologist Jodan B Peterson. These life rules really help me a lot:  1: Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulders Back If you present yourself as defeated, then people will react to you as if you are losing. If you start to straighten up, then people will look at and treat you differently. So, attend carefully to your posture. Quit drooping and hunching around. Speak your mind. Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them — at least the same right as others. Walk tall and gaze forthrightly ahea

Some of the psychological techniques may seem strange, but they really work.  Green apple relieves anxiety If you have claustrophobia in small places, such as subway, elevator and wardrobe, try smelling green apples, which can help relieve anxiety. If you sell a house, you can put a basket of fresh green apples on the table, which will make the buyer think your house is bigger.

Wonder how life would be without dreams? No point. Because there can't be any life without dreams and that's a fact. On an average, you can dream for about 1–2 hours every night and you can have 4–7 different dreams in one night. An average human being spends 6 whole years of his/her life dreami

From the types of people who dream in black and white to the best way to lucid dream, here are 10 awesome realities about our nighttime fantasies.

Can pets have nightmares?
Yes, especially dogs. If you continue reading you will how dog dream and how you can help them and stop it. Can Dogs Have Nightmares? Most folks will agree that there's nothing quite as adorable as seeing your dog bark in his sleep. We like to think that they are chasing squirrels in the park or playing with their favorite toy. How can you be sure your dog is having pleasant dreams, though and not a nightmare? How Do Dogs Dream? Dogs dream during REM sleep just like we dream during REM sleep, but dogs reach this stage much faster than we do. For dogs, REM sleep usually occurs within 15 to 20 minut 

Can pets have nightmares? Let me tell you a story… Years ago, when I was fresh out of school as a certified vet tech, I was working at a local humane society. We had a small terrier mix surrendered to us, who passed all the requisite behavior and health exams, so he went to the adoption floor. Animals come and go daily, so it was rare for us to really pay attention to every single animal in our care. So this little terrier mutt, named Ty Ty, was adopted out within a few days. And he was brought back a couple weeks later, due to what the adopter said was “seizures or nightmares.” A few weeks later, 

I’m not sure about other animals but I knew a hamster that had nightmares. My daughter’s hamster died (as hamsters will do, as they are rather short-lived), and after a suitable mourning period she was ready for a new one. But she wanted one of the long-haired ones, which weren’t that easy to find nearby. We went to the local pet store and asked. The guy said he was all out but we could take a look at the regular short-haired ones. Mariah was adamant that it had to be a long-haired one so I asked when he would get more long-haired ones. He said he had no immediate plans to procure long-haired ha 

Yes, pets have nightmares. I had a precious little dog, named Molly. Molly was actually stolen and brought to me. Her owner would either lock her in the house and be gone for up to a month or more. She had been observed been throwing Molly outside and screaming at her for messing in the house. Other times she would leave Molly outside, with a pile of food dumped on the ground, no water, no dog house and take off for however long. The last time that happened, she had been gone for 2 months. There was several men at a deer camp, next to where she lived, that had been feeding and watering Molly,  

One night our staffy cross Olga was asleep on the lounge and her tongue started sticking out. Then she started whimpering and twitching in her sleep. The louder the whimpering got the further her tongue stuck out. Eventually I had to gently wake her up. Clearly she was being terrorised in her sleep. Our other dog Bruce was bigger but seemed to learn a similar behaviour with no tongue. He would lie on the end of our bed at night and have nightmares. Then one night he woke me up with a dreadful sound of abject terror. I had trouble finding him but eventually did so. He was half under the bed with 

Research has shown that all signs point to yes, dogs and cats can have nightmares. Veterinarian and animal behaviorist researcher Dr. Coates explains, “Determining whether dogs are having nightmares is a bit subjective, but you can sometimes get an idea by watching the way their bodies are moving and the tone of their vocalizations, If what you are observing is similar to what you see and hear when they are awake and upset, they could be experiencing a nightmare.” Is your dog barking or yelping in his sleep? Does he appear irritated or frustrated while still asleep? Is he shaking or twitching?  

Yes, my rescue dog Lulu (the blond on my lap in my profile picture) had nightmares when she came to me three years ago. We don’t know anything about her past—she was picked up on the street, emaciated but weirdly had been recently groomed. She was terrified of men but friendly with women, and freaked out with terror when crated. For the first few months with me, she would flail around and cry in her sleep, and when I woke her up and she realized she was in bed with me, she would snuggle up against me in great relief and go back to sleep. These episodes gradually subsided, and she has had no nigh 

I know they have dreams, for sure and I also think they CAN have nightmares; the reason I say this about nightmares is that my dog was very badly abused as a puppy with the worst of his physical injuries being a broken right hind leg caused by the owner kicking him down the cellar stairs. Now, at age 12, he has a fair amount of difficulty walking as a result. He was about 4 months old when this happened. I have had him for the past 11 years and every so often, he will let out such a sad, long terrified-sounding wail in his sleep that I have to get up and comfort him. It breaks my heart to hea 

Absolutely. I had a badly abused dog who I named Stella. It was so obvious that she had been terribly traumatized before she was rescued. She was terrified of people, especially men. While all dogs dream, Stella would definitely have nightmares. She’d scream in her sleep like she was being beaten. I’d always wake her up. As the years went on, this happened less and less as she grew to trust people and feel safe. Stella lived a long life and died peacefully in my husband’s arms. 1.5K views · View upvotes · View shares · Answer requested by Kelvin Jett6513Phyllis Kress, Student from University of Wisconsin - MilwaukeeAnswered 8 months ago · Author has 468 answers and 658.9K answer views

Yes! Some can have night terrors, especially if they were cruelly treated by another or if they suffered under the hands of sadistic “humans”. If the abuse goes on long enough, the nonhuman companions might even start rejecting any/all living beings around them, including possible offspring due to nightmares/PTSD. Then there are nightmares associated with certain natural phenomenon like severe thunderstorms/earthquakes/wildfires/tsunamis/tornadoes/hurricanes/etc. Hell, Tovarish has trouble sleeping if there’s a severe thunderstorm and/or flash flooding due to PTSD (she was six- or seven-weeks-o

As an INFJ, what do you want the most? What are your dreams and aspirations?
In 2007 I had an open vision. Think what you want, I don’t really care. I know what I saw. I was deep in worship and I saw myself on a stage. Preaching with the full force of the Holy Spirit and fire pouring out of me. Seeing that find it’s fulfillment is my life long dream. I was SO passionate about Christ. To the point that I alienated people. I was a clumsy evangelist. Well intentioned, but just completely clueless. I look back and just cringe in horror. But, we all start somewhere. I was completely sold out and had many supernatural encounters with God. At that point in my life, it was all I 

Wow, great question. I thought about this and then read Farida’s answer.

Maarit, thanks A2A. INFJ-A male sharing my experience. Dreams: indulge in daydreams or fantasies about something greatly desired. Aspirations: a hope or ambition of achieving something. Ambition: a strong desire to do or to achieve something, typically requiring determination and hard work. Well, I’d have to say that I don’t indulge in daydreams or fantasies around things desired. If I want a thing, I see to it that I get a thing. Mind you, my wants are fairly simple. As for aspirations… I kind of go about “hoping” either; as you can see… Hope: a feeling of expectation and desire for a certain thing 

There is a few things I want in life: I want to be in a sincere, loving, respectable and equal relationship.I spent a lot of time being and feeling alone, despite my close group of friends and family. I want to be able to feel a strong unspoken connection with someone. I want to finally be able to share myself with someone without the fear of being judged or rejected. I want to feel respected even if my opinions or answers are weird/ridiculous. I want to learn from each other.

One day my dad who I’ve recently been getting to know since he’s been in out my life (sober 8–10 months now) asked me ..”son what do you want in life what are you after.” now mind you that I sometimes give witty answers cuase he’ll ask things he’s “supposed” to know about or ask about subjects I’ve already brought to light talked about and healed then moved on cuase my moms always been that for me. so to give my dad “real” answers is hard sometimes because I’ve dealt with suicidal ideation I deal with anxiousness .

World Peace, hahaha wasn’t that answer cliché? My former dreams and aspirations came to life and passed, grateful for those memories of some semblances of self actualization. Earlier this year, before the pandemic shut downs; I was involved in a car accident that totaled my car and I was grateful to have been able to crawl out of my car and walk home. I was grateful I didn’t hurt anyone or myself. I was grateful to be home with my two dogs and cat. I was grateful more and more each day to be able to walk, drive again and take care of them.

Ohhh that's a million dollar question. What do I want the most? To be loved by my friends and family, to be shown love, receiving healthy physical and emotional affection. I want a peaceful, quiet and stable life, but with its small share of thrill and adventure. I want to be certain I won't succumb to an illness of any kind, especially mental illness - it's a torture for me. What are my dreams and aspirations? My dreams are to be together with my soulmate, until the end of our lifetime, move to another country, get my own house where I can be myself and be responsible over my own life. I'd love t

Is it true that if you dream about a particular person, that the person will feel like they miss you?
This is my first answer to anything. But I had to  answer this. I studied some psychology in college, and I used to be fascinated with dream psychology, myself. So, let me lay it down for you. The premise in question is equivalent to someone saying "I heard that when your right eye twitches, a girl is thinking about you. And if it's your left eye, it's a guy thinking about you." It's absolute nonsense. Yes, we are all connected, but not in such ridiculous ways. There are thousands of ways we are connected to any given person --- world events, consumer products, entertainment, the types of fiber 

I always wonder that if it's possible since it's random. Like for instance, I had Thanksgiving dinner at a church last year with a friend of mine and her brother and there was this Chinese man that I'm guessing is in his 20’s or 30’s (around my age) was waiting on us and others around the tables and he kept coming over smiling, being very friendly, and flirting with me in particular. It was flattering. I didn't think much of it but as I was leaving the church, he followed us out and was following beside us listening to our conversations as he walked back to his car. A few weeks later, he sudden 

I would say that it is partially true that if you dream about a particular person, that person will feel you. There is a lot we are unaware of dreams. Human beings are used only to accept what our two physical eyes perceive. However, we are multidimensional beings, and we are beyond that we are aware of. While dreams happen in mind, I believe that not all the dreams do, and some dreams occur both at the mind and at higher dimensions of existence. First of all, I have personally experienced these situations that apply this to be true. I have to say, not every time that you dream of someone that  

You ask, “Is it true that if you dream about a particular person, that the person will feel like they miss you?” Congratulations on getting many people to give you their input on this question. Most have told you there is no connection between dreaming about someone and that someone feeling like they miss you. I will try to answer your question in a way that has not been attempted before. The question begins with the premise that you are dreaming about a particular person. What has not been considered (or ascertained) is whether the dream you are having is a dream within a dream within a dream,  

I think it's important that you get a brief idea about the mechanisms involved behind dream work before coming to any conclusion: According to the famous psychoanalyst, Sigmund Freud, there are 3 levels of consciousness (structures of mind): Conscious, Pre-Conscious and Unconscious. As the term suggests, our conscious mind consists of things that we remember or which can be readily retrieved from the memory. Pre-conscious mind consists of thoughts and feelings which we are not aware of but can easily be brought to consciousness. And the most important one, the unconscious mind consists of under

Not necessarily true. Because sometimes we dream about people whom we have never met. And then sometimes we dream about those who are our enemies in real waking life. Do you think our enemies miss us? No, don’t think so. For example, last week, I dreamt of a man who came to me and said to me that I owed him 5 dollars. I know who he is, he is in Quora but am I going to think he misses me? No. I do not owe him anything at all. He does not even know me personally and I don’t know him as well. So coming back to your question, I think the question applies well for those who we already know personally

What are your unpopular opinions on NCT Dream?
Making them fixed unit and adding Mark was the best decison they ever had. Now, Dream really needs Mark. Not only boys love him but Mark really carries Dream. If you ever watched recording diary you would see how Mark helps Jeno and Jaemin with their rapping. Even vocalists Chenle, Renjun and Haechan asks his opinion. They care about his opinion most. Mark's effect on them is so obvious, that it still suprises me how people think ot6 would be a good idea. People are forgetting how Jeno, Jaemin and Jisung started to write lyrics because of Mark. How Haechan said he wanted Mark to monitor him an

NCT Dream should get a full album because they deserve it. Most probably we will get it soon.Anyone who says “NCT disbandment was good” is either a NCT Dream anti or not a dreamzen. I haven’t ever seen a dreamzen saying graduation system was good. So if there are NCTzems who thinks that way stop giving those irrelevant opinions because both dreamies and dreamzens doesn’t need those opinions from you. The members have expressed multiple times how they like to be part of NCT Dream….Eye opener for NCTzens :NCT dream’s choreographies are difficult. (They did not roll on floor in we young and broke

Ok some of these may not be unpopular but these are just my opinions. Disclaimer: I will not be happy seeing some people hating on MY OPINIONS in the comments, these are MY OPINIONS and I couldn’t care less what you think about my opinions so just sit quiet and if you don’t like my opinions why click on this answer in the first place hUh? Mark should not be in NCT Dream, and if you want him to be in NCT Dream, take him out of SuperM.As much as I loved OT7, he’s being too overworked, SuperM, NCT 127, and NCT U???? I’m honestly really really really happy that NCT Dream is a fixed unit (with the ro 

idk who requested for me to answer this, but I'm about to state my opinions. idk if they're unpopular or not. don't get offended. dont get triggered. they're meant to be unpopular, meaning most people shouldn't agree with them. with that being said, let's begin. the first time i heard ‘we go up', i hated it: pretty self explanatory. but i love it now, its one of my favourite dream songs. i literally listened to this song the night before my high school graduation and cried my ass off.i will NEVER forgive nor forget what that manager did to Renjun: i dont care what made her/them leave him behind, 

disclaimer: i love nct dream and nct as whole; this is simply my opinion and nothing more. spread love, not hate. as for my “credentials,” i’ve been an NCT fan since SMrookies day— that’s it lol. *most of these may not be unpopular as well* these opinions are more about their production and performances (non variety because i can create another one for that) Jeno has more leadership potential than MarkWe saw this a lot after Mark’s graduation, how Jeno stepped up despite NCT dream not having an official leader. The Dreamies themselves all agreed that Jeno has the most leadership potential. Don’t

Okay sooooo let’s start. Jeno has the best stage presence in Dream and one of the best over-all He catches your eyes the most out of the members because of his dancing, his energy and his expressions. Renjun vocals &gt; Haechan’s, Chenle’s vocals. Now, don’t get me wrong. Haechan has an extremely unique voice. Like extremely. His technique is amazing and he can effortlessly sing high as well as low notes and melodies. Chenle is so so amazing he has so so much potential to grow and be on of the top vocalists in Kpop. However Renjun just has that something. First off, his vibrato is on point. His voice 

Some of my opinion may not unpopular but here you are.   Mark should not comeback if he will get most lines (again)Mark always get most lines. Ridin’ line distribution is so far the fairest in NCT. Ridin and Boom make me realize that Jaemin and Jeno rap is that good. If SM pulls Mark back to Dream they have to give fair line distribution or else Mark will overshadow other member. Mark and Haechan should choose Dream or 127Especially Mark. I know both of them are talented but they are overworked. NCT U is in hibernation mode so we can cross that now. Dream and 127 recent comeback is only 1 month ap 

-Haechan should receive more credit for things he does. He is a really good dancer and has great technique, but people don’t really talk about it. This might be me, but I also find that in the comments his voice and dancing are never really talked about. Maybe it’s my comments being weird, but like I just wish he would get more credit for his talents. This might just be bias, I’m not sure. -Jeno, Jaemin and Haechan have the best stage presence The only times I notice Chenle, Jisung and Renjun is when the camera is specifically on them. Don’t get me wrong, I love them, but in group shots, I usuall 

Lezzgeddit Btw I've never had anyone request for me to answer so thanks for requesting! Some of these might not be unpopular but anyways… Oh and I going to make my “Unpopular Opinions” answers as positive as possible! Buckle up for a *in Mark's voice* long a** ride 🤣 I'm super happy Mark is back in Dream, but am worried for his health. #4yearswithnctdream btw! Mark (and kinda Jeno too) is the backbone of Dream, no doubt. He is such a supportive leader and all of the dreamies love him so much. The thing is though, he is in all NCT units except WayV, and he's also in SuperM. What makes it worse is t

i really only have two. you see a lot of people saying things like “____ is underrated,” or maybe “____ is better at ____ than ____,” etc, even when most/many people would agree. these two are opinions i’ve never heard from anyone else and i don’t think that many nctzens would agree honestly, but i’ll give it a go. the first is that sm should’ve left dream’s graduation system in place. people went on and on about how it’s cruel to split them apart and such, but they knew what they were getting into. they’ve known from the start that they would graduate. i’m 99% sure sm would’ve made a new unit  

Do ghosts try to communicate to us through our dreams?
Lucid dreamers, what should you really not do in a lucid dream?
Is it true that if you dream about a particular person, that the person will feel like they miss you?
This is my first answer to anything. But I had to  answer this. I studied some psychology in college, and I used to be fascinated with dream psychology, myself. So, let me lay it down for you. The premise in question is equivalent to someone saying "I heard that when your right eye twitches, a girl is thinking about you. And if it's your left eye, it's a guy thinking about you." It's absolute nonsense. Yes, we are all connected, but not in such ridiculous ways. There are thousands of ways we are connected to any given person --- world events, consumer products, entertainment, the types of fiber 

I always wonder that if it's possible since it's random. Like for instance, I had Thanksgiving dinner at a church last year with a friend of mine and her brother and there was this Chinese man that I'm guessing is in his 20’s or 30’s (around my age) was waiting on us and others around the tables and he kept coming over smiling, being very friendly, and flirting with me in particular. It was flattering. I didn't think much of it but as I was leaving the church, he followed us out and was following beside us listening to our conversations as he walked back to his car. A few weeks later, he sudden 

I would say that it is partially true that if you dream about a particular person, that person will feel you. There is a lot we are unaware of dreams. Human beings are used only to accept what our two physical eyes perceive. However, we are multidimensional beings, and we are beyond that we are aware of. While dreams happen in mind, I believe that not all the dreams do, and some dreams occur both at the mind and at higher dimensions of existence. First of all, I have personally experienced these situations that apply this to be true. I have to say, not every time that you dream of someone that

I think it's important that you get a brief idea about the mechanisms involved behind dream work before coming to any conclusion: According to the famous psychoanalyst, Sigmund Freud, there are 3 levels of consciousness (structures of mind): Conscious, Pre-Conscious and Unconscious. As the term suggests, our conscious mind consists of things that we remember or which can be readily retrieved from the memory. Pre-conscious mind consists of thoughts and feelings which we are not aware of but can easily be brought to consciousness. And the most important one, the unconscious mind consists of under

What does it mean when you dream of your twin flame?
Thanks for asking. I’ll do my best to help you navigate this situation. Hopefully this will help you. Well, my initial knew-jerk response was, “…because your twin is probably on your subconscious mind as well as being on your conscious mind which can initiate dreams - often very vivid dreams.” Another school of thought: Your dreams may be coming from Source as a form of “divine guidance” Another school of thought that seems popular: It’s also possible that visitation dreams are also happening. We’re all made up of energy and so as humans comprised of matter, this means we will be emitting an ener 

Twin flame dreams have a very very great significance in the twin flame journey. When they occur, there is some reason always. They do not come too frequently. If such dreams are coming so frequently, we may not take them seriously. :-)  When in separation, certain dreams may trigger the sense of having the need to connect back with your twin. *1- Twin flame dreams will indicate, give you a clue that an action is required from your side to make a contact. *2- Twin flames Dreams will constantly show you what you need to work on. I used to get a series of dreams where I was trying to contact my twin o 

Boy do I wish I knew the real answer to this question, but I will be happy to share my opinions…  I have one particular ex, who was my soul mate and twin flame. We had an extremely passionate and torrid love affair, before it ended after 20 months. I am someone who remembers at least 90% of my dreams, and it has been that way my entire life. I often have lucid dreams, where I can control and direct the dreams. My ex also shares this dream “power”, as I like to call it. Most people do not recall their dreams on a regular basis, nor do they really care about their dreams. Shame for them… Dreams have 

I love talking about dreams! I m rubbing my hands…. I have noticed different kinds of dreams regarding twin flame union. Besides the regular dreams where your subconscious re emerges with suppressed desires and fears, there are some dreams that accelerate our spiritual journey by bringing transformation on our energetic bodies, by preparing us for future events and by giving us symbols that we can decode in order to reach other states of consciousness. I will mention below some dream types that marked my journey. dreams where we meet our twin with our astral body. You see your twin flame next to

Well, for me my dreams of him foretold what was going to happen between us. Examples: I dreamt that he was leaving me (before separation phase) a few days before he told me he couldn't continue the r/sI dreamt that he was moving on with his life before he told me about this other woman he wanted to dateI dreamt that he would marry and impregnate that said woman YEARS before they even got into a r/s and just this year, they're parents to a baby boy. They got married last year.However, in all of these dreams, he was CRYING. We have been in separation for almost 9 years now. No contact at all for a 

It’s All in your Dreams Dreams, we all have them, but what do your dreams mean especially when they are related to your Twin Flame. Do you know how to decode the hidden meaning or are you lost as to why you dreamt certain things? Dreams are said to be the brain’s way of making sense of the many types of life intakes with which it has to deal with. The Twin Flame journey can be one of the most mind blowing things, so to discount your dreams would be foolish of you. During our waking hours the focus of our pursuits are generally geared towards our outward external processes and our conscious actio 

Arte, I’m a very firm believer that we each have our own paths on this journey designed around what our needs are for growth. So with that I’m not sure that it has to mean anything in general about the twin journey itself but may be just specific between you and your twin. I’ve found that, and others have described this as an energetic journey. There are times when communication is needed and times when it’s not, in my experiences, just depending on what each is working on at the time. For me communication was insistent like this until our energies became more balanced together, then it became m 

I dreamt about my twin flame early this morning on New Year’s day. I had woken up at 2 am after three hours sleep then drifted back off into that place between waking and sleeping. This is when 5D experiences occur and I hope it means he was thinking about me as he celebrated the New Year. I have found peace now and am in surrender, or acceptance. I rarely dream about him so was really surprised when I did. I dreamt I was in bed and he came and lay behind me, spooning my body and putting his right arm over me protectively. We lay for some time like that and the next thing I remember is that we  

In a normal situation, it’s very rare for someone to appear in our dreams over and over again. But in twin flames connection, it could happened because this is a common space where our spirits met. What happened inside the dream space regarding the beloved are messages from them. At least this is for me because I am not communicating with him in 2D/3D. There are many significant dreams that surprises me because it was like an answer or advice to a current situation. For example, I was exchanging text with a person that I thought needed help but this person wanted to have a more than friendship  

Since meeting him I only had very few dreams about him and always wondered why only so few when he's always (ALWAYS) on my mind. The last dream I had was a few nights ago. Last month a big earthquake hit Osaka where I live and it was also very strong in Kyoto where he lives. I emailed him late at night asking if he was on… He answers two days later in a stupid was like he doesn't care whether I'm dead or alive. I really felt a shift - I felt like I can't go on being so attached to him anymore if he behaves like this (a 180 degrees shift from how he was that magical weekend). So I wrote him an email 

What are some mind-blowing facts about our dreams?
 Dreams are weird, and even though there's a lot of research based on this phenomenon of sleep, there is still much that we can't explain. But here are some things we do know, and some of it sounds pretty freaky, to be honest. Have a look, and learn something new about how and why we dream up some of that crazy weird stuff we do. You can't walk in your dreams  According to Men’s Health sleep advisor W Chris Winter, MD, your brain has difficulty recreating the physical feeling of your feet hitting the ground when you're sleeping. He says that if you were to look down while dreaming, you'll probably 

1.) Humans are born with a special trait and that trait is "Dreaming" .  2.) Dreams are visual+audio. A video of mixture of our thoughts , wishes , fears and the scenarios, we see in our daily lives, that play in our minds, whenever, we are sleeping.  3.) Dreams are Identified with REM. Rapid Eye Movement Sleep is a type of sleep in which our eyes move rapidly in differently directions indicating an active brain activity. The brain is active as it is when we are awake. REM consolidates Memories.  4.) Non-REM dreams Dreams happen without REM too.  5.) Animals can dream too. We may see our pet moving their p

I have some that will blow your minds out; Charcot-Wilbrand Syndrome can make you lose the ability to dream Charcot–Wilbrand syndrome (CWS) describes dream loss following focal brain damage specifically characterized by visual agnosia and loss of ability to mentally recall or "revisualize" images. The name of this condition dates back to the case study work of Jean-Martin Charcot and Hermann Wilbrand, and was first described by Otto Potzl as “mind blindness with disturbance of optic imagination”. MacDonald Critchley, former president of the World Federation of Neurology, more recently summarized 

Dreams are one of the mysterious &amp; interesting experiences in our lives which may give us hints about future or can be just outcome of our daily lives. Here is some strange psychological facts about Dreams: Controlling Your Dreams Little did you know, people in fact can control their dreams, it’s called Lucid Dreaming. Despite the person becoming aware of their dreaming, he or she continues to dream by focusing on the dream and not letting the mind completely awaken. We Don’t Need Eyes Most people think that blind people can’t dream, or as clearly as regular sighted people. In fact people with bli 

The Average Person Has between 1,460 and 2,190 Dreams A Year.  When you dream, your body is paralyzed. Among the six dreams reported in the New Testament are the dreams that communicate divine knowledge, instruction, and warning to Joseph, husband of Mary, mother of Jesus. According to Plato, dreams originate in the organs of the belly. Plato describes the liver in particular as the biological seat of dreams. Elias Howe (1819-1867) said one inspiration for his invention of the sewing machine came from a nightmare he had about being attacked by cannibals bearing spears that looked like the needle h 

As a regular lucid dreamer, let me tell you a few first- hand things about Lucid Dreaming if the movie “Inception” wasn't enough :  People who stay up late till the day due to their working hours or any other reason, &amp; sleep in the morning are more than likely to heavily lucid dream.These people also remember their dreams better because of the nearly conscious creativity involved.Also people who wake up to a snooze alarm/wake up call/disturbance/pee break before their total sleep is complete are more likely to lucid dream after they go back to sleep.If you watch a movie before bedtime, it is lik

How, when, why, who - there is a reason behind everything and that is exactly what's worth sharing here. Dreams sometimes leave you numb for a day and sometimes you have no idea what you dreamt about. You can really live a whole beautiful life in a dream that you may never be able to achieve in reality. Wonder how life would be without dreams? No point. Because there can't be any life without dreams and that's a fact. On an average, you can dream for about 1–2 hours every night and you can have 4–7 different dreams in one night. An average human being spends 6 whole years of his/her life dreami

1.The Strangers in Your Dreams are Actually People That You’ve Seen in Real Life!  2.You might soon be able to upload your dreams to YouTube! Scientists at UC Berkeley have achieved a major milestone in their quest to create a technology that would let us tap into our brain's imaging systems. They used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and computational models and they succeeded in decoding and reconstructing visual experiences of their test subjects. 3. You can teach yourself to control your dreams. The method is called "lucid dreaming," which means that you're aware of the fact that yo 

 Scientists aren’t sure why we dream. No one has cracked the “dream code” yet, says Patrick McNamara, Ph.D., a dream researcher and associate professor of neurology at Boston University. It’s still a mystery. But scientists have discovered plenty of other fascinating facts about what goes on in the land of Nod. From the types of people who dream in black and white to the best way to lucid dream, here are 10 awesome realities about our nighttime fantasies. People feel the same emotions they do when they’re awake—fear, joy, ambivalence—as they do when they’re dreaming later that night, says Michael G 

Do you think that a narcissist’s worst nightmare is an educated empath?
What are your unpopular opinions on NCT Dream?
Making them fixed unit and adding Mark was the best decison they ever had. Now, Dream really needs Mark. Not only boys love him but Mark really carries Dream. If you ever watched recording diary you would see how Mark helps Jeno and Jaemin with their rapping. Even vocalists Chenle, Renjun and Haechan asks his opinion. They care about his opinion most. Mark's effect on them is so obvious, that it still suprises me how people think ot6 would be a good idea. People are forgetting how Jeno, Jaemin and Jisung started to write lyrics because of Mark. How Haechan said he wanted Mark to monitor him an

NCT Dream should get a full album because they deserve it. Most probably we will get it soon.Anyone who says “NCT disbandment was good” is either a NCT Dream anti or not a dreamzen. I haven’t ever seen a dreamzen saying graduation system was good. So if there are NCTzems who thinks that way stop giving those irrelevant opinions because both dreamies and dreamzens doesn’t need those opinions from you. The members have expressed multiple times how they like to be part of NCT Dream….Eye opener for NCTzens :NCT dream’s choreographies are difficult. (They did not roll on floor in we young and broke

Ok some of these may not be unpopular but these are just my opinions. Disclaimer: I will not be happy seeing some people hating on MY OPINIONS in the comments, these are MY OPINIONS and I couldn’t care less what you think about my opinions so just sit quiet and if you don’t like my opinions why click on this answer in the first place hUh? Mark should not be in NCT Dream, and if you want him to be in NCT Dream, take him out of SuperM.As much as I loved OT7, he’s being too overworked, SuperM, NCT 127, and NCT U???? I’m honestly really really really happy that NCT Dream is a fixed unit (with the ro 

idk who requested for me to answer this, but I'm about to state my opinions. idk if they're unpopular or not. don't get offended. dont get triggered. they're meant to be unpopular, meaning most people shouldn't agree with them. with that being said, let's begin. the first time i heard ‘we go up', i hated it: pretty self explanatory. but i love it now, its one of my favourite dream songs. i literally listened to this song the night before my high school graduation and cried my ass off.i will NEVER forgive nor forget what that manager did to Renjun: i dont care what made her/them leave him behind, 

disclaimer: i love nct dream and nct as whole; this is simply my opinion and nothing more. spread love, not hate. as for my “credentials,” i’ve been an NCT fan since SMrookies day— that’s it lol. *most of these may not be unpopular as well* these opinions are more about their production and performances (non variety because i can create another one for that) Jeno has more leadership potential than MarkWe saw this a lot after Mark’s graduation, how Jeno stepped up despite NCT dream not having an official leader. The Dreamies themselves all agreed that Jeno has the most leadership potential. Don’t

Okay sooooo let’s start. Jeno has the best stage presence in Dream and one of the best over-all He catches your eyes the most out of the members because of his dancing, his energy and his expressions. Renjun vocals &gt; Haechan’s, Chenle’s vocals. Now, don’t get me wrong. Haechan has an extremely unique voice. Like extremely. His technique is amazing and he can effortlessly sing high as well as low notes and melodies. Chenle is so so amazing he has so so much potential to grow and be on of the top vocalists in Kpop. However Renjun just has that something. First off, his vibrato is on point. His voice 

Some of my opinion may not unpopular but here you are.   Mark should not comeback if he will get most lines (again)Mark always get most lines. Ridin’ line distribution is so far the fairest in NCT. Ridin and Boom make me realize that Jaemin and Jeno rap is that good. If SM pulls Mark back to Dream they have to give fair line distribution or else Mark will overshadow other member. Mark and Haechan should choose Dream or 127Especially Mark. I know both of them are talented but they are overworked. NCT U is in hibernation mode so we can cross that now. Dream and 127 recent comeback is only 1 month ap 

-Haechan should receive more credit for things he does. He is a really good dancer and has great technique, but people don’t really talk about it. This might be me, but I also find that in the comments his voice and dancing are never really talked about. Maybe it’s my comments being weird, but like I just wish he would get more credit for his talents. This might just be bias, I’m not sure. -Jeno, Jaemin and Haechan have the best stage presence The only times I notice Chenle, Jisung and Renjun is when the camera is specifically on them. Don’t get me wrong, I love them, but in group shots, I usuall 

Lezzgeddit Btw I've never had anyone request for me to answer so thanks for requesting! Some of these might not be unpopular but anyways… Oh and I going to make my “Unpopular Opinions” answers as positive as possible! Buckle up for a *in Mark's voice* long a** ride 🤣 I'm super happy Mark is back in Dream, but am worried for his health. #4yearswithnctdream btw! Mark (and kinda Jeno too) is the backbone of Dream, no doubt. He is such a supportive leader and all of the dreamies love him so much. The thing is though, he is in all NCT units except WayV, and he's also in SuperM. What makes it worse is t

i really only have two. you see a lot of people saying things like “____ is underrated,” or maybe “____ is better at ____ than ____,” etc, even when most/many people would agree. these two are opinions i’ve never heard from anyone else and i don’t think that many nctzens would agree honestly, but i’ll give it a go. the first is that sm should’ve left dream’s graduation system in place. people went on and on about how it’s cruel to split them apart and such, but they knew what they were getting into. they’ve known from the start that they would graduate. i’m 99% sure sm would’ve made a new unit  

What are your unpopular opinions on NCT Dream?
What has been the most terrifying moment that has happened to you when you woke up?
Well, this is going to be a long list. I get hypnagogic hallucinations fairly regularly, so waking up and being scared out of my mind is a fairly common occurrence. For those that don’t know, hypnagogic hallucinations occur in some people occasionally during the transition from wakefulness to sleep, and what it basically amounts to, is dreaming while you’re (sort of) awake. This means you can hallucinate and see some pretty scary stuff. What I’ve also noticed, at least in my experience, is that even though what I’m seeing is sometimes indistinct or ambiguous, my brain always knows what it’s supp 

Not so much "scary", more upsetting and disconcerting, but here goes. Many years ago, when my brother and I were both still living at home as young adults, we were both awakened by the sound of our dogs barking. At that time we had two small dogs, and they both slept in my bed with me. Our bedrooms were directly across from one another. It was about 2am or so, I can't remember exactly. One dog heard something and went crazy barking, which of course set off the other one. (I know now what set her off was the house phone ringing, though neither of us heard it at the time.) Half-awake and perceivi 

I have two things that I'll share. They aren't the most frightening but they are the strangest. One morning I woke and needed to roll over in bed and when I did that someone's arm flopped over and hit my face and knowing instantly that I went to bed alone and live alone, that no one should be in my bed with me, all this in a split second so I jumped up, or tried to anyways and couldn't because my arm was asleep. My arm was so asleep from being in a weird position that it was like a dead arm for a minute or two. That's why I didn't feel my arm when it hit me and thought it was someone else's arm 

My mom and I have always been close. She’s been one of, if not the most constant and consistent presence in my life. About 8 years ago or so, I was at home in bed. It was probably 7:30 a.m. when I woke up. I lived with a roommate in a tiny two bedroom house. He had already left for work. So I was by myself. I had to be at work around 10. After rising from my bed, I did what any other millennial typically does upon waking: I went to check my phone. That’s when I saw I had over 35 missed phone calls, 25 unread text messages, and about 10 voicemails. The missed calls, text messages and voicemails were a 

Two words. Sleep Paralysis. If some of you don’t know what that is, it’s when your mind wakes up but your body doesn’t. So I’m most cases you wake up and are aware of your surroundings but can’t move or speak for a few minutes until your body catches up. Usually feels like someone is sitting on your chest which makes you feel restricted to be able to talk or scream out. Some cases, you feel the presence of someone or something else in the room. Some research says it happens because there is a paranmoral presence in the room, usually demonic but who knows for sure I guess.  I’ve awoken to this at l 

When I was a senior in high school, I woke up to the sound of my mom sobbing outside of my bedroom. It was strange at first, because it was the kind of crying that I had never heard from my mom - something completely new. In fact, as I was waking up, I initially confused it with laughter. As soon as I realized she was upset, I sprung from bed and threw on my jeans that I had laid out for school that day. I didn’t even bother putting in my contacts or grabbing my glasses as I walked outside of the room I shared with my brother. The door was open, which was typical for us. With my blurred vision, 

I lived in a 3 bedroom apartment in the Bronx during my senior year of college. My fourth roommate was a last minute add on to our original arrangement. Let’s call her Stephanie. Stephanie was a mutual friend of one of my roommates and we welcomed her into our apartment to cut down the cost per person for rent. By doing so, we agreed to convert the living room to a bedroom for her so nobody needed to share a room. Stephanie ended up being extremely messy, inconsiderate and caused a whole lot of problems for our living environment. Just about a month into her living with us, she had brought in be 

My wife and I went on our honeymoon to Indonesia - mostly Bali, but we had an overnight in Java to visit Borobudur. Because that part of Java poses some risk for malaria, we were prescribed mefloquine aka Lariam. I was warned at the time that hallucinatory nightmares were a known potential side effect. In Java, we stayed at a small lodge more or less right on the edge of the Borobudur complex, so that we could hike up onto the structure before sunrise. The room was small but comfy and we settled in early for a good night’s sleep. However, a couple hours before dawn, I awoke quite simply but sud 

“What is the most frightening thing you ever woke up to?” I had moved into a little duplex building. It was tiny and it faced another one just like it about 40 feet away. At the time I worked the graveyard shift at what was laughingly called the Dollar Saver 101 store. It was a little convenience store on the outskirts of a city called Sherman, TX. I worked 11pm to 7am and then, about 7:30ish I would head home on my bike. I would get home, eat something and then go to bed. In bed by 8:30 or so. At the time, I thought it was cool to sleep in the nude. Unfortunately, that is an important item in t 

I woke up one morning to a blinding migraine. One of the worst I have ever had in my life. My ex-husband got up to retrieve my migraine medicine and I heard a loud crash in the hallway. I got up slowly, and shuffled as best I could toward the sound. I found my ex-husband laying on the floor passed out. I was very confused. I stood there staring at him. He opened his eyes and said, “Something is wrong. We have to get the kids out.” He got up again, and we began walking toward the kids rooms. However, it felt like the weight of our own bodies were like that of bricks. It was very difficult to mov 

Is lucid dreaming worth it?
What is China/Chinese dream?
Why was the dream of Hong Kong democracy not achieved?
Hong Kong never have a dream of democracy. Why? If Hong Kong really wants democracy the best time to fight for it will be 1997. Before HK was returned to China. Why wait for 22 - 23 years of of being a genie pig of a system that was not proven? The average HK people have taken basic things that they are enjoying for granted. Their needs and wants trump everything. The riots / terrorist attacks that started 2019, was not aim at archiving domocracy. Its not even using the 5 demands to disguess as the seed of independence. The main objective is to disrupted China via creation of turmoil in HK. Funde 

Hong Kong never really had a chance to begin with. Even the most dark yellow Hong Konger with common sense would see that. Unlike somewhere like Taiwan, Hong Kong really is under the legal jurisdiction of mainland China, &amp; the People’s Liberation Army has garrison in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is reliant on the mainland for essential services such as water, and Hong Kong has no 2nd amendment so no one in Hong Kong owns any guns except the police. Before the protest, Hong Kong people never really cared about politics, &amp; only cared about enjoying life, so this sentiment of being willing to sacrifice to  

Why was the dream of Hong Kong democracy not achieved? Hong Kong Almost achieved it Mid 2019. Picture the International HeadlinesHong Kong Gaining more Democratic rights under the China than under British rule. But alas the keyword is almost. [Edit] done on the 10th Jan 2021, 9am HKT to show case how A Democratic Nation, that allows Universal Suffrage, handles Protest that turn unruly.

Thanks for your question. As a citizen for almost forty years in Hong Kong, I have never worried about and dreamed our democracy. And I suddenly suspect that I don’t know what democracy is. Therefore, I try to figure out the definition of democracy before answering your question. According to Wikipedia, democracy is a form of government in which the people have the authority to choose their governing legislation. Who people are and how authority is shared among them are core issues for democratic theory, development and constitution. Cornerstones include freedom of assembly and speech, inclusiv 

The true essence in any democracy is the people taking their own governance and the collective interests of their state/country to their hearts and in their hands. For Hong Kong, that means the governance of the population of 7.5 million people in an international financial, cosmopolitan city used to be known for the inclusiveness of diversity, the pragmatism and “can-do” spirit of the people to envision consensus among what seems to be mutually exclusive, the respect for fundamental social values like the rule of law, equality and liberty, and general upward mobility by meritocracy. That mean 

Because the so called democracy fighters fight for their own democracy only. They do not fight for democracy for people who take different views. Latest events tell people they care nothing of the dissidents, and they will even take away their freedom to safeguard their own. They are limited in prospects and visions. They would rather spend their time planning humiliation on the “evil” government than look into the societies, economies, systems, cultures within and without Hong Kong, study the lives and need of people of different social strata, make systematic plans to resolve problems effecti 

Can thank the Brits for that. Whether it was Chinese pressure, which is doubtful (I don't see 1970s UK yielding to communist China, but noone says UK couldn’t have been coward?) Or whether it was because the Brits saw no full democracy as better governance rule of HK, for the British interests there the treaty negotiated with China left HK as it was under British rule. Now the same treaty precludes that institutions must not be changed. If there's anything unachieved, you can't exactly blame China, can you. Let's note that HK was a British creation, and that now the British have left, HK has no reas 

What needs to be emphasized is that the requirement of political allegiance to politicians is not unique to China and Hong Kong, but a basic value orientation recognized internationally. Under "One Country, Two Systems", loving the country and Hong Kong is the basic political ethics of politicians in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and it is also the fundamental requirement of the Constitutional Basic Law. It is not that Hong Kong cannot have opposition, but it will never allow the politician behaviors to undermine the bottom line. In the new era of Hong Kong’s society transitionin 

Thanks for A2A The reason is that we already have strong democratic principles in place. We already live our dream. We just needed to wake up. Refer to my response to a similar question: Peter Herbert's answer to Is the Chinese government making it so that there is only a semblance of democracy in Hong Kong after the months of protesting? Democracy is the “control of a group by the majority of its members”. How that control is exerted does not have to be solely through elections. In fact, I would say that elections can force the will of the MINORITY on the majority. This is the case with first-past 

Hong Kong’s democracy is a social experiment, an experiment to compare communist dictatorship and democracy side by side. At the conclusion of the 50 year’s experiment, China will adopt the winner system and use that to unify Taiwan. The one country two system is Deng’s ploy to convince China to adopt freedom and democracy. In his mind, the winner has to be the system of freedom and democracy, because communist dictatorships was failing left and right during his life time and freedom and democracy regimes were all booming. However, things did not turn out as Deng envisioned. Communist dictatorsh 

What does it mean when you dream of your twin flame?
Thanks for asking. I’ll do my best to help you navigate this situation. Hopefully this will help you. Well, my initial knew-jerk response was, “…because your twin is probably on your subconscious mind as well as being on your conscious mind which can initiate dreams - often very vivid dreams.” Another school of thought: Your dreams may be coming from Source as a form of “divine guidance” Another school of thought that seems popular: It’s also possible that visitation dreams are also happening. We’re all made up of energy and so as humans comprised of matter, this means we will be emitting an ener 

Twin flame dreams have a very very great significance in the twin flame journey. When they occur, there is some reason always. They do not come too frequently. If such dreams are coming so frequently, we may not take them seriously. :-)  When in separation, certain dreams may trigger the sense of having the need to connect back with your twin. *1- Twin flame dreams will indicate, give you a clue that an action is required from your side to make a contact. *2- Twin flames Dreams will constantly show you what you need to work on. I used to get a series of dreams where I was trying to contact my twin o 

Boy do I wish I knew the real answer to this question, but I will be happy to share my opinions…  I have one particular ex, who was my soul mate and twin flame. We had an extremely passionate and torrid love affair, before it ended after 20 months. I am someone who remembers at least 90% of my dreams, and it has been that way my entire life. I often have lucid dreams, where I can control and direct the dreams. My ex also shares this dream “power”, as I like to call it. Most people do not recall their dreams on a regular basis, nor do they really care about their dreams. Shame for them… Dreams have 

I love talking about dreams! I m rubbing my hands…. I have noticed different kinds of dreams regarding twin flame union. Besides the regular dreams where your subconscious re emerges with suppressed desires and fears, there are some dreams that accelerate our spiritual journey by bringing transformation on our energetic bodies, by preparing us for future events and by giving us symbols that we can decode in order to reach other states of consciousness. I will mention below some dream types that marked my journey. dreams where we meet our twin with our astral body. You see your twin flame next to

Well, for me my dreams of him foretold what was going to happen between us. Examples: I dreamt that he was leaving me (before separation phase) a few days before he told me he couldn't continue the r/sI dreamt that he was moving on with his life before he told me about this other woman he wanted to dateI dreamt that he would marry and impregnate that said woman YEARS before they even got into a r/s and just this year, they're parents to a baby boy. They got married last year.However, in all of these dreams, he was CRYING. We have been in separation for almost 9 years now. No contact at all for a 

It’s All in your Dreams Dreams, we all have them, but what do your dreams mean especially when they are related to your Twin Flame. Do you know how to decode the hidden meaning or are you lost as to why you dreamt certain things? Dreams are said to be the brain’s way of making sense of the many types of life intakes with which it has to deal with. The Twin Flame journey can be one of the most mind blowing things, so to discount your dreams would be foolish of you. During our waking hours the focus of our pursuits are generally geared towards our outward external processes and our conscious actio 

Arte, I’m a very firm believer that we each have our own paths on this journey designed around what our needs are for growth. So with that I’m not sure that it has to mean anything in general about the twin journey itself but may be just specific between you and your twin. I’ve found that, and others have described this as an energetic journey. There are times when communication is needed and times when it’s not, in my experiences, just depending on what each is working on at the time. For me communication was insistent like this until our energies became more balanced together, then it became m 

I dreamt about my twin flame early this morning on New Year’s day. I had woken up at 2 am after three hours sleep then drifted back off into that place between waking and sleeping. This is when 5D experiences occur and I hope it means he was thinking about me as he celebrated the New Year. I have found peace now and am in surrender, or acceptance. I rarely dream about him so was really surprised when I did. I dreamt I was in bed and he came and lay behind me, spooning my body and putting his right arm over me protectively. We lay for some time like that and the next thing I remember is that we  

In a normal situation, it’s very rare for someone to appear in our dreams over and over again. But in twin flames connection, it could happened because this is a common space where our spirits met. What happened inside the dream space regarding the beloved are messages from them. At least this is for me because I am not communicating with him in 2D/3D. There are many significant dreams that surprises me because it was like an answer or advice to a current situation. For example, I was exchanging text with a person that I thought needed help but this person wanted to have a more than friendship  

Since meeting him I only had very few dreams about him and always wondered why only so few when he's always (ALWAYS) on my mind. The last dream I had was a few nights ago. Last month a big earthquake hit Osaka where I live and it was also very strong in Kyoto where he lives. I emailed him late at night asking if he was on… He answers two days later in a stupid was like he doesn't care whether I'm dead or alive. I really felt a shift - I felt like I can't go on being so attached to him anymore if he behaves like this (a 180 degrees shift from how he was that magical weekend). So I wrote him an email 

What have you done in 2020 that you never dreamed you would do?
I accepted my muscle loss. As a multi-sport athlete in lockdown, my relationship with my body has been tested heavily. The other day, I found an old picture of my biceps from last year, and it made me nostalgic all over again. A year ago, I could do over 50 pushups in one set. Today, when I sit down, I can hold my stomach in my hands. Showers can be hard for me sometimes. I hate standing under the water looking at the wasted potential of my body. Where I used to have defined muscle is now soft, and the only person responsible for that is me. I went from spending four hours in the gym daily to occas

“What have you done in 2020 that you never dreamed you would do?” Stayed at home all day everyday vegetating for months at a time. It’s quite a shock after being used to going out almost every day walking in London, visiting museums, galleries, parks, gardens, historical and cultural sites of interest. I have a friend who actually chooses to spend his time (even before Covid-19) at home all day every day. Fair play to him, that’s his choice and he’s happy. I never dreamed I would be forced to do the same though. 37 views · Answer requested by Amy PotterKinshuk Srivastava, System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services (2017-present)Answered February 19, 2021 · Author has 190 answers and 210.3K answer views

2020 was a weird year for the entire world. The day-to-day routine of every individual has been turned upside down which no one would have imagined in their wildest dreams. Speaking of myself, I can list down the following things in this context- Stayed in home for nearly 10 months. Me being in the IT sector, have been working from home for almost a year now.I would have never imagined I would not be eating outside food for almost an year. Similarly for a movie buff like me who used to watch at least two movies in a month in cinema halls, not seeing any movie on the big screen for such a long t

I wouldn’t say that I never dreamed that I would be able to accomplish this but I certainly would never have imagined actually being able to do it while in my 20’s.

In 2020 I purchased a 2015 Mustang GT, it’s now my second car that I’ve owned. My first car was originally in another family member’s name then transferred into mine. With the Mustang however, I went to the dealership, I did all the paperwork and conversing, I signed my name on all the forms, and I ow

I stayed home in fear for about 3 weeks. F^&amp;k me, that was something I didn’t ever see myself doing. I try to challenge myself because I can slip into a fear-based lifestyle having seen plenty of shit during my 74 years and you know, it could happen to me too, But that is an unhealthy way to live, very limiting and also bad for mental health, so I go out and do stuff that is somewhat risky.

Could our dreams be from parallel universes?
I believe so.  I often dream of myself, my family, etc with slight but significant changes. Houses are different but still familiar, relationships exist, I am me but slightly different. People who are dead are alive. I believe that those we consider dead are simply some place else. That there is a some place else. That religion and myth and folklore have distorted the glimpses we get of that other place. My grandmother, aunts, uncle, cousins and parents have all died and yet for decades I've had interactions with them in something that is unlike the same "feel" as a dream. I think we all sense some 

There is no connection between a dream and any universe. Dreams are created by spirits. First of all you must know something about spirits. Spirits are separate elements. A human being doesn't have a spiritual body. A human being during his/her lifetime is living with many spirits which have joined one by one since birth. They are knowledge, skills, feelings, emotions, interests and everything. (These spirits watch, guide and determine the destiny of a person from his/her daily activities, talks and thoughts too.) Even thoughts are not your own. For example, when you want to take a decision on 

Though it isnt proved yet that parallel worlds exist but, I believe its possible. I mean - why not? So many people have experience with strange things that seem out of this world so why couldnt there exist several different realities? I believe they may not even necessarily be all located in a different universe. Probably, just a really small “quantum wall” stands between our reality and the different ones. I must say that some of my dreams really seem to be out of another, very similar but still different reality. I remember e.g. a dream where I have an older sister who looks very similar to m 

Some, maybe, but most, no. Let me explain, because I have done extensive research in this area. Most dreams are derived from what's on our waking minds, our secret desires, or just our brains blowing off steam based on stuff that we've seen before or thought about. That's more than 90% of what dreams are. A few of these may take the form of lucid dreams, which are dreams that we can control because during the dream, we realize we're dreaming. Ever have a dream that wasn't lucid and involved a place that you've maybe never remember being to? Or a place that you recognize but key things are diffe 

I've had such a dream last night. It was a real puzzled one. I was so confused and at the same time felt trapped in it that I abruptly woke up early than my alarm goes off. So…here I was in a supermarket with my brother searching for cheese munchkins (and I don't know what the hell it is) and at the same time surfing web on my phone. There was a decent crowd in the store and everything was normal. I was not able to find the big munchkin box and my brother was caught up with his friends there. It felt like I was not allowed to interact with anyone…like a soul amidst humans! Still I was so involv 

I do not know whether that's true or whether it could be or not. But it is certainly intriguing. We can't say with absolute certainty that this is not possible because the idea of a 'multiverse' hasn't been rejected yet. Neither has the idea of an 'alternate universe' been rejected. Coming to the question at hand, Is it possible that we slip into an alternate universe when we are dreaming? The only way this is possible is if we travel through some mysterious wormhole witnessing weird dimensions that we know nothing of. By the way, yes it is possible that dimensions other the conventional X, Y  

Dreams and the paraellel universe I do not believe are directly linked. For me, dreams bear relevance to this universe (or the version of it I am in at the present time), they are sometimes directives or fantasies represented metaphorically. I agree with the idea that one purpose of dreams is for your subconscious to interact with the conscious in a vivid manner and within a dream is the most appropriate place as a lot of thinking goes into a dream so whilst asleep in a safe place it happens. During REM you are most vulnerable by the way because your brain is ‘super busy’ with this dream and y 

I can’t answer yes or no to your question but it’s a good one. We pay far too little attention to this alternate shared reality: It is important to make a dream of life and of a dream reality. – Marie Curie. I think it was her I read about who received inspiration from a dream. I was told by someone only 2 days ago that he had dreamed a picture on a wall and seen the identical picture on a video shown to him at work the next day. there are many examples just from searching on duckduckgo “In a dream I saw a table where all the elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it  

I believe, dreams are a “what if” simulation of scenarios of things or events that have occupied ones mind for a while. I see a variety of dreams almost everyday and it has become quite a practice for me to research on what that dream could possibly mean. For example, i very often see lots and lots of chewing gum coming out of my mouth. Its not really a chewing gum but a very sticky substance that has got stuck to my tongue and keeps filling up my mouth the more i try to pull it out and get rid of it. It makes my mouth absolutely useless and i get very irritated (of course in the dream). Now, on 

well, the first mistake in this hypothesis is that this universe and the “parallel” universe somehow are at a bridge during dreams. This of course causes a problem. if the content of the dream belongs only in either realm, then there is no interaction. if dreaming is somehow some third state that’s neutral to either this world or the parallel universe, the question that follows is, how can parallel universes be parallel if they have a point of interaction? Now, an age old question is probably the motivation for this wonder. How real are the contents of dream?. The skeptical wonders are at least

IF IT’S TO GOOD TO BE TRUE THEN IT PROBLY IS! THE GRASS ISN’T ALWAYS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE! YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TILL IT’S GONE! There is a reason why these saying exist. There is no such thing as “The American/Canadian Dream”, at least not in the way it has been depicted/portrayed or implied. YES…. It could be “A Dream Come True” depending on whare and what country you live in. And that is what “YOU” consider horrible conditions.

We Canadians are reticent folk, who don’t advertise the great white north as representing the last hope for humanity in a manner akin to Americans. We further don’t indulge in notions about “Canadian” exceptionalism, or were imbued with a sense of mission via Puritanism. Nope, Canada’s motto of peace, order and good government isn’t romantic compared with life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

These are two different desires. The “American Dream” is based on “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”.. This is Innocuous enough at first glance, but in the fullness of time and opportunity, this becomes a chase for wealth, and not of concern for all of society. Canada has a motto of “Peace, order and good government”. That aspiration means that the collective means are available for the benefit of Canadian society.

Question - “Is the "American Dream" replaced by the "Canadian Dream"?” Answer - LOL!!!! ABSOLUTELY NOT! To be clear - the real “American Dream” is living in a country where the government is restrained by, and constrained by the unalienable rights of its citizens. That dream has NOTHING to do with being a serf, living at the benevolence of an all powerful State that can grant, or take away privileges (since there are NO unalienable rights) at a whim. It doesn’t matter if the ‘whim’ comes from a ‘majority’ vote or not. That sort of a primitive society (akin to the Dark Ages) is NEVER ‘dream’, it’s  

There is no “Canadian dream” and there never has been. The “American Dream” is the idea that if you embrace hard work and determination you will achieve wealth, prosperity and greatness. I am pessimistic of this idea because the real world is full of people who are hard-working and determined, yet utter and complete failures. There are also lazy successes; people who’ve just lucked out and fallen forward over and over again. The American Dream cannot be replaced with the Canadian dream because there is no ethos called the “Canadian dream” to replace it with. 365 views · View upvotes6Lawrence Black, former Future P.M. / C.E.O.

Thanks for the A2A. It could certainly be argued that way. Canada has a much higher degree of social mobility than the U.S. In other words, in Canada, you can be born poor and still make it to the Middle Class or higher.

They love to jump from one place to another. 92 viewsHarsh Lilhore, Enthusiastic learner.Answered 6 months ago · Author has 89 answers and 580.5K answer viewsOriginally Answered: What can we learn from the kids?

What was the hardest lesson you had to learn at your first real job?
I was 19-years-old when I started work at my first real job as an “adult.” It was the perfect job for a young, inexperienced, naive girl, out on her own, alone, in the big city. I was a receptionist at the health dept. I learned important skills that followed me for the rest of my life. Of course, I made a lot of mistakes. I thought working was like being in a family. I thought everyone looked out for each other; I thought we were family. I thought the people I worked with closely were my friends. All of those premises were dead wrong. These are the realities: Some people you work with can becom

This is relevant for me as I just started my job recently 1.5 yrs ago. I have observed a few things which I would like to share with the newbies: Try to grab the manager's attention for the right reasons. Learn the skill which has been given to you and try to improvise on it.Don't be overfriendly with anyone at workplace and try to maintain a distance. It's better to have ‘close friends' from other projects than your own as others won't be jealous with your promotions and professional success.Try to finish off the work within the stipulated time or less and then maybe read a book. We have kindl

So I’m on my first job, barely couple of days in, and one day I’m pulling a late sitting (just to impress the CEO who was also staying late in his office). Suddenly at about 7pm he barges into my cubicle and asks about the office boy (he left at 5 ofcourse). ‘So you’re the new guy right?’ ‘Yessir!’ ‘Good. Make me two photocopies of my passport, make sure they’re clean and readable and bring em to my room asap!’. He tosses his original passport on my desk and walks away in a hurry. I’m staring at the passport and wondering what the f**k I’m gonna do?? Make no mistake I consider myself pretty tech savv 

People are nice at the beginning, when they’re training you. Then you’re the slow new guy, that everyone is sick of.When you start your new job, never show how much you can work hard, or try to be the star, that’s how you make enemies.Never be too friendly with your colleagues, ’cause when you become their supervisor you won’t be able to contain them.When fighting for promotion don’t expect others to play fair.When you first start your job, try being friends with that person who is closest to your boss (assistant, vice president..). That’ll make things easier for you in the future.Do not have

Whether you are someone who barely scraped through in college or the class topper - it doesn’t matter. Nobody will ever ask you your GPA. Instead they will ask you how many deals you have closed.Building work ethic is one of the most important aspects in the first job.In college, you can do well in the exams by simply studying a few days before. But to build clientele is something that happens over a period of time.Networking is so very important. “Your network is your net worth” - Grant CardoneBeing employed by the biggest and best company in the world is a highly subjective thing.

I learned that not everyone will be nice to you even if you are nice to them. In most cases, when we are nice to others, others will be nice to us. Not in jobs where money or responsibilities are concerned. In my first real job, I worked as customer service. Basically I sold clothing for men and kept the store in a proper manner. I met a lot of different kinds of people but the hardest are people who do not reciprocate your kindness. They come from both customers and colleagues. For customers, there are plenty of stories. There is no need to elaborate much on how some people are self-entitled an 

Thanks Susan for a2a. When I started by first job as telegraphist in a government department, I was hardly 17. I had to learn quite a few things. My worst nightmare was that I was terribly short of money as I had to look after my two siblings and mother was with me. I did not expect any support from relatives. That was perhaps I would not be asking from them or seeking loan. I knew I would not be able to pay back on time. Within a few months I started having some savings because of extra income from overtime. I noted that there were habitual people borrowing money and not returning at all. IN C 

Top 5 Lesson I learned from my first job My first job was in a MNC company as a Quality inspector of automotive parts. Lots of new things and lessons i learned at that time. Trust yourself first :- When you are fresher at that time we are little scared of doing work at workplace. But if you know that , you are right then never take any mistakes on your side .Be confident :- You have to be very confident at workplace because when you have lack of confidence then your colleagues or seniors try to show you down (mostly in MNCs).Learn the system :- This is very much important when you have some star

The first job I had, like many young men back in the 1960’s was delivering newspapers. The first real job that I had, with taxes, withholding, etc. was when I was fourteen and I worked at the Village Dairy. It was an old time delicatessen. We served meals, soda, and ice cream stuff in the back in a bunch of booths and tables, and we served ice cream, hand slice meats and cheeses, etc. up in the front, along with penny candy, and that kind of thing. It was right next door to my junior high school, so a lot of people I knew would come in after school, as I was starting my shift. I learned all kin 

What are some lessons that life teaches you?
Make choices keeping in mind that one day you’ll be thinking about it all lying on your death bed.Be generous. People will remember you with a smile.Sometimes the punishment for your wrong is to live with it.It’s okay not to finish a book you’ve started reading.Smile. Laugh even when it seems impossible. Even people with HIV are strong enough to smile and live.Take risks to do things you’re not allowed to. It creates memories.It’s okay to manipulate your family.

Life is a lifelong teacher and traveling puts it in perspective. 1. Choose Growth “Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” – Neale Donald Walsch For my vacation, the only arrangements I made was booking my airfare ticket and the first two nights at a local hostel. My primary goal was to have a spontaneous trip by asking other travelers for recommendations. This allowed the opportunity to travel freely without restrictions. For example, if I found a city I was particularly fond of, I have the option to extend my stay. This wouldn’t be likely if I had already preplanned all my accommodations in a 

Valuable Lessons are always learned after the time has lost. No one cares for you except your parents and for the most part your siblings, except them each and everyone out there is a spectator and has nothing to do who you are and what you do. You are just an another human being for them and no one gives a damn whether you succeed and earns millions or die in a state of indigence.Promises are meant to be broken, hard way but still the truth. Life will give you many examples of this as you progresses. People will betray you when you needed them the most and this will not make you not weak, but 

That life is not only about success, failure and being the best in the world. It is also about love, gratitude and actually living it as a human. Living does not mean earning good and having a prestigious bungalow. It's a lot more. It's about experiencing that high of life and high of our thoughts. Enjoyment doesn't mean the grand parties and bashes. Rather, it comes through our inner self. Enjoyment is experiencing our own existence. Today, we all are so busy that we have forgotten our existence. We just keep working, to only survive in this rat race. We never experience that this magnificent n 

Below are my life lessons (please read my background story afterwards to understand where I am coming from): Life is NOT and will never be fair. Whatever life situations you find yourself in, do your best to rise upon your challenges without making too much excuses. It starts with where you are born. The so-called lottery of birth. Do you think if is fair to be born in Aleppo, Syria right now with missiles and bombs flying around your head? or Some kid getting born from wealthy parents and others from poor families?Depend on and trust yourself only. Never rely ( heavily) on your friends or fami

Some people think that what happens in their lives are out of their control. These are the folks who wait passively for what life dishes out to them. They have minimal goals, and they are the ones who usually hope for the best that life will be kind to them and that they will eventually be at the right place and at the right time. Other people, meanwhile, realize that life is a great opportunity for learning and for realizing their fullest potentials. These people proactively try to understand how the world works. They set goals and learn all they can as they set out in the direction of their d 

I never really had to stand on my own two feet before. Until recently. This past year, I experienced a few major life changes all at once. I’ve learned that I had to go through the pain to come out the other side. But I also learned that you won’t ever get back up unless you choose to. I saw a quote recently that said “Something will grow from all that you’re going through. And it will be you.”  Making the wrong choices I’ve recently written about my struggles over the past year, and about how all my life, all I used to do was “eat, sleep, and science.” Working 24/7, never stopping, always achievi 

Life is a great teacher. But it’s teaching strategies are quite different from typical schools. In schools, they first teach a lesson and then take your test but the life has it’s own mysterious ways. It takes test to teach you a lesson. So, to get specialized in the lesson of life you need to give more and more tests. A few lessons that life teaches are : Money can buy you comfort but it can’t buy happiness.Everything in the world is a trap, they first attract you toward themselves and when you reach there you realize that you are trapped in it’s cage of attraction.Everything that you want is n

 Great fortune comes with hidden poisons. More money often equals more problems.Sometimes anger can have unique benefits of its own. Imagine that you want to do something you’ve always thought of doing in life. Something you’re sure you’ll succeed in. But then there comes a person, trying to convince you that you will certainly fail no matter how hard you try. You get angry and your motivation doubles; you are ready to prove them wrong. Not to mention, to prove yourself right. And before you know it, you’ve done it. The anger fueled you to win the fight. This is just one example, but you alread

Backpackers: What are the most important things/lessons you learned from traveling the world?
Pee whenever you see a bathroom, you never know when you will see another oneAlmonds are a girl’s (and boy’s) best friend, and is more important than even lipstick (So if you have to make a choice, choose wisely). Regardless of the size of the city you are flying into, never assume that there is a welcome committee waiting for you with a smorgasbord of food…..especially if you are vegetarian.Always have a bottle of water in your bag, except if you are going through an airport. In Thailand, even the empty bottle seems to be problematic, and size does make a difference!Hospitals: Life-saving ins

Immersing in a Different Culture is a Great Way to Learn About Your Own. Why is it not socially acceptable for American bachelors to live with their married sister’s family? Why are men so isolated in America? Why do we only hang out with people of a similar age in America when 60 year olds hang out with 18 year olds in Thailand? Why don’t senior Americans have a place in society like senior Thais do? I never even knew I believed or did these things until I lived abroad.

Hi people! I tried not to read any other answer so I could give my own personal opinion without “copying” anyone. Here it goes! I guess what you learn from each experience in life depends on your character and how you accept and assume everything that happens to you, but for me, these are my most valuable lessons: Everything that “matters” in the Western society is almost a lie. I don’t want to sound extremist, but it’s just how I feel. The more material things we have, the more we want, the more we worry and fall into huge depressions. It doesn’t make any sense to me.

I have travelled to 4 continents (Africa, Europe, Asia and North America and also Middle east) covering multiple countries in between them. What I learned from the world. People: People are generally warm and helpful. No matter which country I travelled, I have always recieved assistance with directions, food, travel and stay. There is no hatred between common people and we all like to help each other. Only the greedy politicians paint picture of White vs Black/Brown, Our country vs Theirs. No such hatred exist on ground.

Lesson No 1 : You don’t need things to be happy.My first vacation 7 years back - I had a check- in bag, a back pack, a laptop bag, a camera pouch and a tripod. And this was for a period of 12 days. Only last week, I was back having spend little more than a couple of weeks in Balkans - and all I had was one shoulder bag. The lessons I learnt gradually in my travels, also influenced my regular life. Less things is the best to have a happier and more meaningful life. I am minimalist now, I have never been more happier.

These quotes summarize the lessons I got by travelling - “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow mindedness and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts.” - Mark Twain Travel taught me to appreciate similarities and accept the differences without really hating anyone. The media / internet feeds us with so much negativity around the world and yet when you travel, you find most of people doing the same things like you do. Go to work, hang out with their girl / boy friends, take their pets for a walk, buy an ice-cream for their kids, get drunk, go for movies, travel etc. Major 

I currently live in China and work as an English teacher. I have always had a huge passion for travel, but only in the last few years have I really started to learn more and more. Here are some of the things I’ve learned so far: Learn to love eating alone. Once upon a time, I really feared walking into a restaurant and saying “table for one”. Now I can say that in five or six different languages, and I say it with such confidence that nobody blinks an eyelid. They don’t care that your by yourself. They want you to enjoy their food and pay your bill, and potentially tell other people about it. I

3 of the best life lessons I’ve learned from traveling the world  Alyssa Satara’s Instagram You don’t need materialistic things to make you happyYou don’t. Through my travels I’ve collected new things, and left things behind. I’ve also seen the poorest people with the biggest smiles. What I valued the most while traveling is the people I am with, the views (both geographical and in terms of perspective) I get to see, the experiences I get to feel (and the food I get to try). Each trip I’ve taken— whether it was to Turkey, Hawaii, Egypt, Peru, Paris, Dubai, Croatia, India etc—have been their own litt 

Anyone who has ever taken an economics class has heard the phrase, “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” It means that everything has a cost, even if that cost is not always immediately apparent. To achieve anything, you must give up something else. Over the span of seven years, I have visited 26 separate countries, dozens of new friendships, hundreds of fascinating people and experiences, and even picked up a couple languages along the way. Picking up and leaving my life behind in 2010 and spending the past seven years vagabonding about the planet was both one of the most challenging and rewa

What do you wish people would stop doing?
In my opinion something that a lot of people should stop doing is eating meat. Or at the very least stop eating beef, or reducing their meat consumption. Now before you assume anything. The main reasons why I believe people should stop or reduce their meat consumption have nothing to do with me believing that eating meat is immoral or that those who do so are evil people. It has more to do with the fact that eating meat is quite possible one the most environmentally damaging things that we all do regularly and if we reduced our meat consumption we could reduce the effects of climate change and e

Looking many of my friends in their 20s, I could see them taking pride in basic things they don’t know and celebrating the same on Social Media. Starting from ‘I don’t know to cook dinner to managing one’s expense with their limited income’ the list goes on and on. When I moved out of my parent’s house I never knew how to cook, do my own laundry or manage my own expenses. I learnt everything over the period of time because I had to survive in this city and build a life on my own. The main reason was that I was ashamed of knowing those things when I could see some of my other friends doing it on 

 I have often noticed beautiful slim girls come over to me complaining “See.I haven’t gone out of my home for so long I’ve gained so much weight?” It’s quite obvious that they haven’t grown even an inch but they like crying over it.“Do I look fat in this dress?” People ask it so easily in front of such people who are actually overweight.Even if the person has the lightest skin in his/her group, he/she will casually say pointing towards their group pic “I have come so dark in this pic”.You’ll often hear people saying “This dress is good but the color doesn’t suit you much. Try some dark colors”.

I went for shopping at a mall. I went towards the trial room. Because all the trial rooms were occupied I had to wait for my turn. A man, probably in his late twenties came towards the trial rooms. I found him noticing me a couple of times. I tried not to pay any attention towards him but we can't generally ignore someone whose eyes are staring each part of our body. Can we? Minutes later, his wife came out of the trial room. She was frequently coming in and out, for suggestions for clothes, which she was putting on. So I was pretty sure that he was a married man. But his eyes were still screening m

I wish people would stop commenting on other people’s weight. Why? I was at the gym the other day, walking on the treadmill, and I glanced at the girl next to me who had been running non-stop on her treadmill for the last 35 minutes. I admired her dedication. Her name was always the first to appear in the register, every morning at 5am, and she never missed a workout, not even on a Sunday. As I was getting ready to leave, I watched a lady come up to her and ask her how many days a week she worked out. “I aim at 7”, said the girl. The lady smiled appreciatively. “Its good that you’re trying to be

My sister did a little makeup but the pimples were still visible especially the spots. Anyways, we reached the hall and met many other relatives and other people.

Not all introverts are shy: On Quora, I find that most people use the word ‘introvert’ as a euphuism for the word shy. The word introvert is actually used for someone who derives their energy from being alone, and feels drained after spending time with large crowds. While introverts do have a tendency to be quite, it does, in no way mean that they are shy.Feminism is not bad: I have gotten into countless debates on this issue. They often confuse feminazis for feminists. Most people come here with an assumption about feminism, and often confuse it with misandry.Feminism: The advocacy of women's

This page is now at 10.1 m followers and there is not one single reason for it to have this kind of traffic on the site. Similarly, there's also a “ROBOT” girl on Instagram called @lilmiquela.

Ok so disclaimer first. I'm not trying to change anyone's opinion on this matter nor do I feel it is up to me to convince anyone of this. I am simply putting it out there as something I wish other people knew about. There that being said the only proof I have of this is just open your mind and read the Bible again with this knowledge.

That they are not alone in this world. They are interdependent and a social animal. Money can get you, your necessities but not peace. Health is the biggest wealth of all.

Children have feelings. They know when you aren’t interested, when you don’t want them around, or when you’re prioritizing yourself over them. I’m talking young children, younger than about 7.

I see these things happen all the time. It’s usually a family with an only child that acts like this; parents that have children with siblings will help their horse kid out Or have older siblings help if they can’t, because they understan 

I wish people knew that Women should not ask for metro seats from Men. Especially women who call themselves feminist. and I wish people knew that FEMINISM IS IMPORTANT FOR MEN TOO.

That (providing) service is just as important, if not more, than products. In this day and age of mass production coupled with the popularity of online shopping, people can get a cool product for a dollar or less. This doesn’t help people realize that a tangible item isn’t the only thing that provides value. I’ve lost count of how in my own country, people who have real skills that took time to be developed - like repairing computers or cars, teaching English, providing legal advice, driving (esp. in the jungle that is Manila) get shafted. It’s not limited to developing countries, though. There a 

Got up early this morning, business meeting a 30 minute drive away, maybe an hour taking traffic into account. Shower's warm, shirt's clean, coffee's good, I'm out, traffic is vibrant but OK all in all. Flat tire. Front right wheel. Wonderful. I tell myself “My kids are healthy, my wife is heaIthy, I'm healthy”, take out the kit from the trunk and get to it. Within 2 minutes my hands look like after an average day in the coal mine.

You get one wish, but 70% of the entire population also gets exactly what you wished for. What’s the wish?
Ready to test your fortitude? Then let’s take a trip to a deserted tundra—all expenses paid, of course—courtesy of one genie, who pities those I’ve victimized. “You have one wish?” the genie says. “And you choose to exploit an enchanting getaway to initiate collective suffering?” Perhaps you’ll share the genie’s sentiments; perhaps not. It’s likely you’ll dislike, resent, . . . even abhor me—at least, initially—for wishing for this painstaking journey mired in solitude and minimalism and unpleasantries. But remember, the greater the risk, the greater the reward. The Destination . . . This desolate 

Depends if I can make a compound or complex wish. There are several really strong competing choices here. A lot of the answers involve a fairly convoluted “wish,” which could be parsed into a long series of simpler wishes. If the rule is just that it’s a sentence, I can butcher compound clauses with the best of them. The classic is three wishes, so here are three that I would carefully glom together into one extended compound “wish.” And if I couldn’t? Any one of the three would make a good choice. Continued perfect health. I wish for immunity to illness, disease, and deterioration. There’s a lot  

Here is my wish, I will legally receive $ 1 million in after tax U.S. dollars for each week in the past five years during which I lived in the United States, living paycheck to paycheck with absolutely no extra money or savings in reserve whatsoever, such amount to be reduced by $ 1 million in after tax U.S. dollars per each cup of coffee or per each serving of green vegetables that I consumed during that time. So, for me, this means: Number of weeks in the past five years where I lived in the U.S. and I lived paycheck to paycheck with no extra money or savings = every week for the whole five ye

Well, normally I would’ve wished for money, or cars, or some cool stuff like that. But, in the face of the recent coronavirus pandemic, I would wish for a kit - wait, no, ten -with these items in it: 100,000 N95 masks - should be enough to protect us for at least a yearA compact mask production device with the materials to make 10,000 more - in case we run out (which is extremely unlikely)Food packages with canned and microwaveable food enough to last a year (and none of it will expire after a year)Water packages equivalent to 1000L, also enough to last a yearBleach and toilet paper and cleanin

I would wish to get another wish with different conditions (yes, the other 70% will get that too). The new rules are:1. Everyone gets exactly what you wished for.2. Wishing for more wishes with other rules than the ones stated here is not possible.3. Anyone who is affected by the wish can cancel the wish. If that happens, the wish grants a wish to everyone with the rules stated here.4. You can’t wish to invalidate the wishes granted by this.5. If you ever state a wish under those conditions, everyone will know what you wished for by just looking at you. Not only is this an infinite recursio 

there are a lot of wishes that spring to mind if you can make references to yourself that will continue to refer to you when applied to others. For example, I might say, “I wish to give money to Clinton Weir” or “I wish to cast a vote for Clinton Weir to be Emperor of Earth” or “I wish to give my wish to Clinton Weir”. You could get the same effect by referencing a number (identification number, bank account number, address). For example, I wish to mail $10 to (insert address). Because these would make the question too “easy”, I’ll assume that any attempted reference to oneself will be replaced  

My wish would be simple. A set of rules. Anyone may grant a wish to another. No wish may be granted that reveals the date in which a person shall die. No wish may be granted that unnaturally extends life past that date though wishes may be granted to unnaturally end life. Resurrection of the dead is prohibited unless a wish was directly used to end that life. In this case, a wish may not directly be used to end their life once more. Theft of will is prohibited directly. Though any wish that manipulates or coerces a person may be allowed. The power to grant wishes may not be passed on to any generati 

I get one wish, but 70% of the entire population also gets exactly what I wish for, hmm… I wish that 70% of the world population would not have to live with poverty. Of course, this would only apply to the individuals of the 70% that are living in poverty. Currently across the globe, 10 percent of the world is living on less than $2 a day, which any lower is considered a state of poverty. Considering that roughly ten percent of the world population is living in poverty, I do believe that 70% covers 10%. This wish would greatly impact the world and here is how: Poverty would simply not exist.When li

“You get 1 wish, but 70% of the entire population also gets exactly what you wished for. What’s the wish?” Query: Do you mean 70% of the US population? Or 70% of the world’s population? If the former, here’s my wish. I would wish that the US have a stable non-fiat based economy with all debts, both personal and national, paid off in full.To expand upon that I mean that all of my debt, car loan, school loan, credit cards, IRS, etc as well as the 70% of the population that needs it the most AND that the nations debt be completely paid off (No more Debt Clock which is currently at almost $22 Trill 

As a physician or RN, what is something you wished you could tell your patient but you knew you would get in trouble for it?
What is something you saw in someone else’s parents that you wish yours had?
Love. Comfort. I know my mom loves me. I know she does. But my mother cannot express her love through words, emotions or show affection. I could never figure out why. My cousin had both her parents growing up. Her father is my mother’s brother. So since my mom was a single mother raising 2 kids she always worked. She worked everyday. We never went without anything though and my mother always provided everything and more for us. So I’m thankful for her believe me. so growing up she never showed if she was struggling or hurting. Because of that I’ve only seen my mother cry maybe 2 times in my life 

Electricity. My mother convinced a kind old mountain hermit to let her park our cab over camper one his property. I was 13. We had already lived over a year on my mom's 25 acres in an unfinished barn shell. Unfinished means studs: no insulation (or drywall, ha!), plumbing or wiring. Just keroscene lamps and a keroscene heater. The smell of that I couldn't stand though it kept us warm, kind of. When the first big snow came, not enough. Eating food straight out of cans was ok, but not when snow cold. Various county agencies drove us from that property. Stan the mountain hermit let us park our camp 

I met my best friend, Debbie, when we were eleven. She was the only friend I had that also went to the same church. Debbie made “church” bearable. It wasn’t long before I fell in love with her mother, Barbara. She was amazing. She spent time hanging out with us, playing games, and what I loved most, laughing. She was the first adult in my life that treated me like a person. Don’t get me wrong, she treated all of us kids like people. My fondest memories of my childhood are from when I spent time with Debbie and her mom playing Spoons and laughing until we cried. I love to laugh. I laugh all the  

Respect. I didn’t realize until I was grown up that housewives who didn’t earn any money were still deserving of value and respect. I spent an anguished childhood seeing my mother being belittled and devalued and insulted worse than a maidservant. I watched as she begged my father for amounts as little as a rupee for over two decades till my brother started earning and giving her some money. I witnessed the repeated humiliations she silently endured from relatives who shamed her for being stingy, or for ill-managing the house, knowing full well that she was given no money to finance anything. I  

A real, well my real, daddy. He died from cancer when I was 4. I've never been a jealous person. I'd always been the more “well off" of my friends...it wasn't planned that way, it just happened. The only thing I ever saw that I can ever remember wanting was my daddy. I had friends with single parents but I had a lot more with both, or at least two, parents that loved and cared for them. Don't get me wrong, my mother was amazing. She loved me, cared, for me, made sure that I had everything I needed and most of what I wanted, and she taught me to appreciate those things. I remember being at frie 

When I was born, I was the miracle child that my parents thought they'd never have. They spoiled me and loved me to no end. Then four years later my brother came along. He was named after my dad and was the heir apparent. I can remember standing in the driveway feeling confused and somewhat abandoned as my mom left in a taxi to give birth to him. From the day he came home, nothing was ever the same again. He was the favorite son. My dad was over the moon with the fact he had a son. Soon the lines became drawn. It became so obvious. My dad would bring him home boxes of baseball cards every day.  

Trust. Love. Friendship. You see, growing up, watching those cheesy teen movies in where they usually have a great bond with their mom or dad and talk about everything, like boys/girls, boyfriends/girlfriends, friendship problems, self esteem, confidence, mental health, etc. It never got to me but then I saw girls at my school saying how supportive their parents/mom/dad are with them. I WISHED I had that. A friendship relationship with my mom. I can’t even tell you how HAPPY I got when one day, I didn’t have school so my mom and I went to the mall together. We talked about her past relationshi 

Support. When I was a kid, I remember my father would tell us these dreams he had for me and my siblings. How we’d grow up to be so well educated and successful. I cherish the times when it was just the 4 of us (my father, my siblings and myself) and he’d go on for hours telling us everything he could see us doing in the future and how he’d always support us. It was great. But sadly it was over too soon. As we grew up, his support didn’t fade, of course. My father was always very serious about our studies and I didn’t really mind, it wasn’t extreme or anything; all of my friends’ parents were an 

I have this friend, let’s call her Mary ( Hey “Mary” if you ever see this and recognize yourself, I hope you don’t mind it!) for her privacy’s sake. Mary’s parents are wonderful, it’s not like my parents are bad or anything, they’re amazing in fact. It’s just when I see how her parents brought her up I wish my parents did the same things. Her parents got her to get her driving license as soon as possible while my parents were hesitant, and I understand their fear but a driving license is essential to kickstart you into adulthood. You must have one for emergencies at least. And besides the more 

Calmness. Love. My mother was overly fearful, and hypercritical, and a micromanager, simply, often hysterical. Every snack or meal was managed by her, or criticized. Every friend analyzed to be sure they were "good influences." The sad fact is, she rarely liked my friends. She often asked why I wasn't friends with Lori or Brenda. What she didn't know is those girls didn't want to be friends with me, and in the case of Lori, she was actively a "mean girl" who joined others at school to make fun of me. But Lori was a "good girl with good grades" in my mother's reality, and would be a "good influen 

What is something you wish you had known sooner?
What is one device you wish would go away that still exists?
Phonecalls (both landlines and mobile phones). Get me right, it’s a splendid thing that you can pick up a device, and communicate by voice with friends, relatives and businesses for any purpose at all from ordering pizza to congratulating your grandmother who lives on the other side of the country on her birthday. The problem is not with voice-calls in general, but rather with phonecalls as a way of doing it. It’s a kludge on top of a kludge builty on a city of kludges. And it’s really deserves to die. Compared to actually reasonable communication-protocols, here’s a few of the shortcomings: Ther

I wish the retractable leash (Flexi-lead) would cease to exist. There is nothing that frustrates me more than walking a dog using one of these ridiculous inventions.  This may seem like a good idea to dog owners who want their dog to have more “freedom”, but in reality they are dangerous to both pets and the people who walk them using this type of leash. There is even a warning label affixed on the package!  The theory behind the retractable leash is that it lets the dog control the walk, but anyone who understands basic dog training knows that you, not your dog, should be in control. Why is it co 

 This device is a “printer-copier-scanner-fax” machine, and it’s an evil abomination from the 20th century that needs to be buried once and for all. Not just “buried”, but they need to do it 13th-century Vampire style: stake through the heart &amp; bury it face-down so that can never dig its way out again. They’d also want a priest to do last rites on it first, but trust me, that won’t save this beast from eternal fire. InkJet Printer: These were developed solely to make money on replacement cartridges. Everybody knows that now, which is why half the country ends up injecting after-market ink into us

What is one device you wish would go away that still exists? Business Cards It’s customary. You meet anyone professional, you exchange cards. But why? Well, when the business card was invented (or at least a form of the modern business card was) in the 17th Century, paper was really the only way to record information. You couldn’t plug it into you’re cell phone or set a reminder. Cards were used. If you are interested, here is some history: The History of Business Cards: Four Centuries of Introductions Now, let me ask you; when you recieve a card, what do you do with it?

GAMING CONSOLES Play stations and Xbox Ones, I don’t mind Wii…... But why do I want the consoles gone??? We (PC gamers) love gaming and the game industry with a burning passion. Unfortunately for the industry, modern consoles are sucking it dry. No, that's not to say every console manufacturer is responsible for this, and it's also not to say the ones that are responsible are doing it all the time, but it's still harmful. Consoles are directly harming developers, gamers, and the PC platform with their petty exclusivity and dishonest marketing wars. Manufacturers like Sony and Microsoft ask develo 

Front screen camera of cellphone is one thing I wish would go away. After I came back from my solo vacation last month, I posted some pictures of my trip on my Facebook. Then there are a lot people (especially younger generation under 25) asking me about these pictures; and I was shocked at their questions. I will post one of my pictures for this answer.  The conversation always goes like this when they see my picture: Them: Did you go by yourself? Alone? Me: Yes and yes, why? Them: How did you take that picture? Me: My phone, Samsung Note 3. Them: NO! I mean how did you take picture that far away? Me: 

QWERTY keyboards − they encourage racism and oppression. Even for speakers of US English, the keyboards are arranged in a sub-optimal way, slowing down typing. By only making some letters available, this keyboard encourages its users to alter other people’s languages and even bastardise English by removing é, ï and à.  The prevalence of QWERTY keyboards caused the spawning of bastardised versions like AZERTY with a few letters added or rearranged, which were then marketed for other languages. This keyboard can also take part of the blame for programming errors. Instead of using mathematical symbo 

Well, I can think of 2 devices right now is gaming console and tablets. These devices has many negatives than positives.Who uses the tablet just to play games that causes laziness and obesity to the children from 3yrs old to adult. Playing outdoor sports since childhood is the healthy habit to lead a healthy lifestyle to an extent. Benefits of Sports Physical exercise is good for mind, body and spirit. Furthermore, team sports are good for learning accountability, dedication, and leadership, among many other traits. Putting it all together by playing a sport is a winning combination.

Seat belts. Yes, seat belts. Calm down. Let me explain. As much as the libertarian in me screams about the freedom to do ridiculously stupid things like not wear your seatbelt, that’s not the primary motivator this time. There might really be something better out there. I don’t know. Neither do you, probably. The fact that seat belts have been so great at saving lives and preventing injury contributes to their persistence in the face of obsolescence. See… government require all automakers to install them. You can’t sell a car in the US as a manufacturer unless belts are present. So even if you ha 

Anything camera phone related. Once upon a time: Years ago, the camera was a beautiful invention. It was originally created to capture the beauty, the magic, and the priceless moments enjoyed with family, friends, and nature that you could treasure for years to come. Then, you actually set the camera down, and went back to living in the moment. It was fun to wait for your photos to develop, picking them up from the store when they were finally finished. Then, going home and being excited to see how all of the pictures turned out, reliving the happy memories all over again. What the camera has bec 

What do teenage boys wish teenage girls knew?
We love seeing you smile.I think you guys have no idea how cute you are.Especially when you lay on our chests/shoulders/laps. I tell you, that’s the cutest thing ever.Sorry, but looks really do matter. But don’t get discouraged! It’s quite easy to look nice. All it takes is pretty much taking care of your hair (Who doesn't take care of their hair though?), being somewhat in shape, and just looking in general like you have some sense of presentation.And don’t believe things like “All the guys just want the top girls with thick butts and the most curves and a huge bust”. No, not true at all.Conf

I think I am qualified to answer this as I am a teenage boy. So, here goes… If you reject us, don't gossip about it. We hate embarassment and from then every guy will be scared of getting too embarassed and no one will ever ask you out again for fear of gossip. Also many guys will just lose respect for a girl who makes fun out of spreading rumours.Kindness is uber-attractive. If you are nice to us we know that you will treat our families and friends with respect. Also, the kinder you are to us, the more positive experiences we have around you and the more we will want to be with you. However som

We masturbate.We have watched/watch porn.A single word from a girl we’re interested in can either fuck up our entire day or make it the best one. Ever.Don’t play mind games with us. It can be heartbreaking thinking that someone you liked only played with your feelings for fun.YOUR HAIR IS AWESOME. It doesn’t matter if you didn’t have time to fix it in the morning. Have you seen ours?Wearing make-up is absolutely fine. Just don’t come to school looking like a painting.Looks matter. Different for everyone but they do.Most of us do not want sex. We might just want someone to share our emotions wi

if you find us attractive, please just tell us. We hate it when you keep trying to ‘drop hints’ or things like that. They never work. Ever.Not all boys are the same, we don’t just want to have sex and show you off as some form of trophy.(This applies for male and female) if someone holds the door open then don’t be a twat, thank them as you go through the door. It really annoys me when people don’t do this.Don’t go out with us because you either feel sorry for us or you got dared, same applies if it’s for a joke.If someone asks you out and they’re weird or social awkward, then please don’t go 

I honestly want to take a crack at this answer, and why not go for it! Disclaimer: This is opinion, please don’t get overly salty. This is meant to be a calm helpful answer. If you’d like to respectfully disagree, we can debate in the comments but this is meant to give people a different point of view. Thanks.  So upon seeing and reading through the question “What do teenage girls wish teenage boys knew”, I decided to look for the counterpart. Here I am now. •Boners happen. It’s natural. We don’t control it. However we can move it like a crane sometimes. (Sorry 😂)  •We sometimes can go too far. A lot  

Speaking as one guy who is not a chick magnet (and who had a quick read on here beforehand lmao) I shall reinforce what my fellow brothers from other mothers have put forward: Girls, stop it with the stereotypes. We are not all rapists, we’re not all obsessed with sex and porn, we all have sad lives that exist outside of that.That being said, to the guys that are creeps and you women make it clear to us that what they’re doing is unwanted, we’ll hunt him down and snap his kneecaps.Don’t let/make us do all the work in a friendship or relationship. You need to put effort in as well if you want it

Writing this from the viewpoint of a non-douchebag high school junior (answers may vary for people who do not subscribe to the non-douchebag part) Unless we are a natural girl magnet, communicating with the girl we like is rather hard for us. Surprisingly, flirting for a lot of guys comes easy (not all) if they are just flirting with some random girl, it is when we start out a conversation with a girl we like that brings out the awkward pauses, umms, and general unattractiveness. This is largely due to extreme anxiety, and pretty much as soon as you reciprocate some of the flirting back, we eas

Other guys are vultures Always looking for an opportunity to swoop in and take any shot at a girl they have. We can tell when your pathetic guy friends are circling, and maybe that’s why we don’t trust em. Don’t attribute it to hypersensitive jealousy. Like Biz Markie said, don’t ever trust a girl who says she only has a friend. Read Ethan James's answer to Who is a "nice guy" to see what I mean by a vulture kinda guy. Why We Don’t Reply Girls tend to be more active than guys when it comes to texting, social media and most forms of online contact, actually. Not to say that guys don’t spend a lotta 

Shy boys will never cheat on you because they are too scared to find another girlPhysical contact is fine but getting freaky is…..uncomfortable at least it would be for me.We know what periods are and it is perfectly ok to talk about it in front of us. I would get a bit uncomfortable if you talked about it but i would still listen.Don’t be so self concious around shy boys because most of us have never had a girlfriend so we will accept you for who you are. Also most shy guys are incredibly nervous about their appearnceWe want to make you love us as much as we love you.If you catch us staring i

Girls who gossip are the worst and will get no respectWe’re honestly very clueless as to whether or not you like usThe hot girl is hot, yes, but she will lose our attention is she doesn’t have good personalitySorry, but your looks really do matterAlthough as said before, they don’t matter is you don’t have a personality to go along with. In the opposite way, personality will not win us over alone if you aren’t at least slightly above averageDressing well is impressive and importantIntelligence is VERY attractive.We’re actually scared of you.

What do teenagers wish adults understood?
What's something people do that screams "I'm looking for attention"?
 Eating a snake ALIVE and posting it on line.  Eating pigs died of disease RAW And check this out, this man just blew up his genitals by a string of fire crackers  So, are they mentally challenged or something? Guess again! These videos come from a phone app in China in the name of “ Kuai shou”(fast hand, translated literally) You may never heard of it , but it is the fourth largest phone app in China with a number of users up to 400 million! It totally astonished me. I am Chinese and I spend 8 hours on social apps such as Quora and Zhihu( Chinese version of Quora), but I have never heard of this! It fee 

Making self-deprecating comments without it being ironic on a regular basis. There’s some people who are legitimately insecure. You can tell, by their comments and their overall attitude. With that kind of people, I don’t mind at all trying to help the, lift their self-esteem, especially when I do see something positive about them that they genuinely don’t realize. However, there’s another kind of person, who may appear insecure on the surface but, when you pay attention, you can tell they’re just looking for attention.

People walking about in public with bloody rats , parrots etc on their shoulder. People who insist on taking large dogs of special breeds to crowded fairs , markets and similar inappropriate places “ Ooh isn't he gorgeous, what breed is it? How old is he? “ Most of us have a dog or two at home but were sensible enough to leave them there . Not so these attention seekers who use the dog , rat or whatever as a sideshow exhibit to draw attention. They are like little kids with show and tell. Pathetic really if that's all they can come up with to gain the interest or involvement of others . It's a  

I'm a Rapist! People share all kinds of nonsense on social media but I've come to love it for 1 advantage: many of us cannot mask our true characters on there as well. We put all our extremes/highlights out there for everyone whether they want to see it or yes! Disney vacations, engagements/proposals, weddings, sky diving, really cool outfit, spanking new house/car, our new butt (implants), 6-packs or boobs! If we're idiots, we have to put it on social media. Racists, sexists, pedophiles, homophobes…. &amp;…..

 Image source: Google Yes guys, I just screamed for attention by putting this picture. Now that I have it you might as well know the different kinds of behaviors that indicate that the person is calling for attention from others. There is not just one thing but many things that scream that someone is clearly looking for attention. These behaviors are displayed both on social media and in real life. So by the end of this answer, you should have learned to spot those behaviors and other related behaviors. So let us go ahead.  Eating junk food and at the same time complaining to the entire universe you

 How do you spot someone looking for attention? Watch how they listen. I was at a networking event for founders and growth hackers in LA. The guest list was a who’s who – some of the biggest names in Silicon Beach, but also a fair amount of upstarts and rising stars. Most people attended purely to make new connections. But I needed something specific. I wanted to hire a growth hacker to work on a campaign we had coming up. I was looking for someone young and new to the scene – someone who wanted to prove themselves. Someone hungry. If I found the right person, I was ready to bring them in for a lon 

A girl looking like this Posting a selfie and saying “Oh my God, I look so ugly today.” 2. There is this guy I know, a friend of friend, who helped someone for the first time in his life and made a video of it and posted it on Instagram the next minute. 3. A girl I used to know would take one shot of vodka and then would act like she's drunk, just so she could act all “obviously sexy”, and everyone would be like “oh, she's just drunk”. 4. I met this girl on the second day of college. Within five minutes of knowing each other, she had already poured out her entire life story in front of me, includi 

I was asked to make this answer after I commented on another's answer about a picked on girl who went through a very serious transformation after being bullied. My comment on the answer in question has 130 up votes, from me explaining how similar my situation was also at that age. So here is the answer I was asked to give, based on my comment. What screams “I want attention”? Transforming yourself to such an extent that even your closest friends and family fear for you. When I was in school, elementary, middle, and high, I was bullied. Constantly. My weight. My looks. My style. My personality… N 

People these days (including myself) seem to need constant validation by others to function in society. Some subtly provide themselves with this need, and some obtain their validation in the most annoying and bothersome ways possible. One prime example, snapchat. Certain people constantly are posting pictures of themselves on their story, sending them privately to other people, etc. This may seem normal, but wait, there’s a catch. These are the captions you usually find on those photos. “Oh my god, I’m so ugly”“Ew, look at [Insert small and unimportant body flaw here] on my [Insert random body par

Lying about having illnesses or being bullied. I used to have this friend. I was 12 when I became friends with her. Let's call her Kate. For the first year of being friends with her, she seemed like a genuinely good person. Then she started using this somewhat unknown social media site since her mum had banned her from social media and it was easier for her to hide that she was using this site. She started talking to people and most of them claimed to be suicidal and have various mental disorders. One of them (who she was dating) even faked their suicide just to upset her. By the way, I know it  

What are the types of people that you should always avoid?
Avoid is probably not enough. I was once in my apartment which I was renting with my girlfriend some 10 years ago. She invited one of her girl friends over to our place to see each other and have a cup of tea. She showed up with her boyfriend. It was September, they had just returned from their vacations in Asia. They hadn’t seen each other for months and they were eager to show each other all the cool stuff they had been experiencing. Our vacations were not that exotic as theirs but quite interesting through the Balkans, where my girlfriend got to meet my parents and family. Being from a Norther 

I understand that my answer will probably affect more who lives abroad than who doesn’t and has not interest in leaving his/her own country, but in my fairly long experience away from my own country, what I really came to avoid is people that moved to a country and keeps complaining about everything and everyone there, and constantly talking about how much he/she misses home, and how “things are better there”.For example, I lived in London for a few years, and was sick and tired of talking with Italians (I am Italian, I guess the name tells it) that, holding their slice of pizza take-away bou 

I’ve been living 39 years and in that time I’ve met thousands of people. I’ve worked with people in numerous industries and from all walks of life. I’ve never had the luxury of avoiding a single person or type, and have been thrust into interactions with everyone from the poorest disabled woman to an actual billionaire. Here is my list of the types of people you should unequivocally avoid being friends with, or being kind to. But rather than avoiding them entirely, I would encourage you to speak out against these behaviours. Being able to keep doing what they’re doing in the dark is the reason  

put my two cents in here, excepting a few explanations already given by others: people who are too “nice”. If it ever seems to you like there is something up about the way someone is always too nice, there probably is. Don’t chance it.Socio- and Psychopaths, if you can.Similarly, manipulative and toxic people. My sister is one of these. Toxic people, for the record:are usually nosy and want to know everything about anything you doare manipulative and will use any leverage they can get to screw you over in some waynothing is ever good enough for themthey are always way too preoccupied with their

Here are the 10 types of people, among other, I try to avoid: 1. The “Askhole” The Askhole is the person who asks for your advice, tells you how wise and helpful it is, thanks you for it, does the exact opposite of what you advised, asks again for your advice on the same problem, and repeats this cycle to leave you eventually feeling like that pair of jeans which has seen one wash too many. 2. The I-me-I This is the person who talks about one thing and one thing only: himself. The I-me-I will leave you bone-tired - physically and mentally - with his incessant talking and almost unendurable, detail 

People who have a negative opinion about an entire demographic but tell you you're "different," or "one of the good ones," so you can be pals. You'll see people who are racist, or sexist, or hate an entire religion or nationality, but then "make an exception" for the few examples of people they happen to know. These people are ignorant and bigots. Don't be friends with them because they happen to like you. People who are perpetually self-destructive but will not acknowledge how their choices damage their lives. I'm not saying you should shun anyone with bad habits. We all have them to some deg

While not nearly as severe as some of the groups of people that were presented here, I’d like to propose the complete avoidance of those people that completely change depending on who they’re in a relationship with. You know, the Beckies and Selenas and Jordans who fall intensely in-love with people they barely know and are ready to put their lives on the line for these strangers, even compromising their being. I’ve met two of these cases so far. One of them was an incredibly meek guy. The type of person who soils himself just because you moved too fast for some reason. He was hopelessly romantic 

People that heavily trash talk their exes. Instant red flag. You loved them once. Give your past relationships respect and move on.People that “one up” all of your stories and achievements. This usually means the person is an extremely insecure and vindictive person who secretly wants you to do badly so that they feel better about their own shortcomings. They’re the kind of friend that just can’t be sincerely happy for you.People that hardcore flirt with people’s boyfriends or girlfriends in front of their partners, often making sure the person notices it. These people suck. These people are o

They often cannot accept that you are better than them, and they may pour cold water on you when you are happy when you have achieved something. They may also treat you as a certain kind of competitor, wanting the same things as you, or developing the same hobbies as you, and want to surpass you.And if they can’t be better than you, they will find ways to destroy your happiness.

What are the types of people that you should always avoid?
Avoid is probably not enough. I was once in my apartment which I was renting with my girlfriend some 10 years ago. She invited one of her girl friends over to our place to see each other and have a cup of tea. She showed up with her boyfriend. It was September, they had just returned from their vacations in Asia. They hadn’t seen each other for months and they were eager to show each other all the cool stuff they had been experiencing. Our vacations were not that exotic as theirs but quite interesting through the Balkans, where my girlfriend got to meet my parents and family. Being from a Norther 

I understand that my answer will probably affect more who lives abroad than who doesn’t and has not interest in leaving his/her own country, but in my fairly long experience away from my own country, what I really came to avoid is people that moved to a country and keeps complaining about everything and everyone there, and constantly talking about how much he/she misses home, and how “things are better there”.For example, I lived in London for a few years, and was sick and tired of talking with Italians (I am Italian, I guess the name tells it) that, holding their slice of pizza take-away bou 

I’ve been living 39 years and in that time I’ve met thousands of people. I’ve worked with people in numerous industries and from all walks of life. I’ve never had the luxury of avoiding a single person or type, and have been thrust into interactions with everyone from the poorest disabled woman to an actual billionaire. Here is my list of the types of people you should unequivocally avoid being friends with, or being kind to. But rather than avoiding them entirely, I would encourage you to speak out against these behaviours. Being able to keep doing what they’re doing in the dark is the reason  

put my two cents in here, excepting a few explanations already given by others: people who are too “nice”. If it ever seems to you like there is something up about the way someone is always too nice, there probably is. Don’t chance it.Socio- and Psychopaths, if you can.Similarly, manipulative and toxic people. My sister is one of these. Toxic people, for the record:are usually nosy and want to know everything about anything you doare manipulative and will use any leverage they can get to screw you over in some waynothing is ever good enough for themthey are always way too preoccupied with their

Here are the 10 types of people, among other, I try to avoid: 1. The “Askhole” The Askhole is the person who asks for your advice, tells you how wise and helpful it is, thanks you for it, does the exact opposite of what you advised, asks again for your advice on the same problem, and repeats this cycle to leave you eventually feeling like that pair of jeans which has seen one wash too many. 2. The I-me-I This is the person who talks about one thing and one thing only: himself. The I-me-I will leave you bone-tired - physically and mentally - with his incessant talking and almost unendurable, detail 

People who have a negative opinion about an entire demographic but tell you you're "different," or "one of the good ones," so you can be pals. You'll see people who are racist, or sexist, or hate an entire religion or nationality, but then "make an exception" for the few examples of people they happen to know. These people are ignorant and bigots. Don't be friends with them because they happen to like you. People who are perpetually self-destructive but will not acknowledge how their choices damage their lives. I'm not saying you should shun anyone with bad habits. We all have them to some deg

While not nearly as severe as some of the groups of people that were presented here, I’d like to propose the complete avoidance of those people that completely change depending on who they’re in a relationship with. You know, the Beckies and Selenas and Jordans who fall intensely in-love with people they barely know and are ready to put their lives on the line for these strangers, even compromising their being. I’ve met two of these cases so far. One of them was an incredibly meek guy. The type of person who soils himself just because you moved too fast for some reason. He was hopelessly romantic 

People that heavily trash talk their exes. Instant red flag. You loved them once. Give your past relationships respect and move on.People that “one up” all of your stories and achievements. This usually means the person is an extremely insecure and vindictive person who secretly wants you to do badly so that they feel better about their own shortcomings. They’re the kind of friend that just can’t be sincerely happy for you.People that hardcore flirt with people’s boyfriends or girlfriends in front of their partners, often making sure the person notices it. These people suck. These people are o

Have you ever put another customer in their place after they were being rude to the staff?
What do you avoid?
I avoid many things but these are the particular things which I avoid and try not to imitate strictly: Avoid staring women in public (Can’t guess what she will think and take any action)Avoid chatting with girls on social media (These are the same girls who will call you cheap if you try talking to them more often)Avoid flirting with random girls (Who knows when a flirting is taken as 'commitment' and later on filed as rape cases! Sounds weird but that's true)Avoid sending friend requests to unknown girls (That's something really disgusting and even I hate it when I get any unknown request)Avoi

I work at intentionally avoiding people, places, and things that are harmful to me. I discovered a while back that I have incredible power simply with the choices I make about my life. Today, I get to choose who I spend time with, where I go (which includes how I spend my money), and what kinds of things I engage with on a daily basis. The people I choose to spend time with today are those who live their lives with integrity, who live lives filled with kindness and compassion, and who have a life-vision that we are all here to learn to love and take care of one another. We gather to share the go 

I avoid drinking other people’s drinks at ALL costs. When I was about 12 my auntie, cousin and I were visiting a friends house. We'd just bought some Maccas - McDonalds for non-Australians :P - for lunch being nearby and took it to the house. About 20 minutes after eating I too finished my drink, however was still thirsty so looked for anything that might've been close by. Moments later I saw my aunties Maccas cup which DID originally have coke in it (and assumed it still did), and took a hefty gulp… oh my that backfired instantly.  As soon as I started to drink my mouth began to burn and taste t 

Thank you for the A2A! We all want to be happy. We often talk about how badly we want happiness, yet we keep repeating the same unhealthy habits over and over again. The best way to achieve happiness is by eliminating things that aren't serving us anymore. So read the following list of what I should stop doing, and make my life happier today… Listening to Public Opinion ~ It's just because the majority of people believe something to be right or true does not mean it is. Most people do not have the courage to express their own beliefs and, as a result, simply follow the steps of others, regardles 

I avoid a lot of things, but the most thing I avoid is: Social Situations I'm a very shy person, even if it was my mother or father, or a teacher I knew I won't talk to them. Just earlier my boyfriend wanted me to join his class for the house so I could see his presentation (it was coding, so I wanted to see but I couldn't) because I had study hall that hour. The minute he said he was not asking her, I would had to I started having a mini panic attack and ran away. I literally was seconds away from crying, probably from frustration. I always cry from frustration, I have no idea why and I hate it 

Internet trolls and a-loggers. According to them I seem to really like being picked on by them, I don’t. They made it sound like I have some kind of fetish for it. I don’t. I don’t take them seriously, and I especially do not go on any website they may talk about me on. I was talked into joining TWO stupid forums with these types of people on them and it was a big mistake. The second time was something I didn’t want to do, heck I didn’t even ask to be involved with them but apparently I did something to upset them by making fun of their beloved website and talking to them did nothing, I was ta

If you’re looking for an upbeat and cheery answer, keep scrolling, because this isn’t it. Sorry to all the wonderful Healthcare providers, but I avoid y’all like most people try to avoid the ‘ronies. As an NCAA athlete, here’s my rule about when to seek out healthcare: If I’m injured for more than 2 months and still struggling with functioning in school, daily life, or athletics, I’ll ask for help. Keep in mind that most NCAA schools have medical staff devoted solely to helping athletes and often mandate that all injuries get reported as soon as they are noticed by the student athlete. To be ho 

Well!I don't have any answer for public interest but still I want to say what I avoid!! Actually I loved a girl very badly but now since she is not with me I am sad and all happens with everyone right?but when she left I cried for one and a half months daily day and night got used to smoking and all because am not able to forget her and when new academic session started I tried to fall in love again and liked some girls but ultimately it made me a pervert and girls enjoy me because am a little handsome and all but nobody understands that am just broken very badly from inside just need someone  

I avoid many things. Starting from the most important ones, here goes: Ignoring someone. Ignoring someone is the biggest insult you do to someone. Please avoid it. It breaks too many hearts, than solving certain problem. For example: Someone is trying to communicate something and am ignoring. That's too rude for me to even consider it for an animal.Playing mind games. I hate it when someone does that. I find it pretty hard to tolerate it.Attacking someone emotionally. I honour my emotions a lot. I don't like people playing with my feelings.Making someone jealous. I don't like people getting jea

I’ve learned over the years that where you end up is as much a function as what you avoid as what you do. Why avoid something? Avoid it if it is going to make life worse for you in some way. Life is hard enough. I sat down and thought about this and didn’t realize exactly how much I avoid until now. Here is an eclectic list of just a few of the things I try to stay away from. Dark soda - My doctor says I have kidney stones and I must stop drinking any dark-colored soda. So I did. No big deal.Alcohol - I have nothing against having a drink now and again. It’s just that I can’t do it anymore for me

What is something you consider rude that certain people don't even consider?
Can I tell my manager off when they are rude to me?
Which seemingly “nice” behaviour is actually a sign of manipulative/cunning behaviour?
I never trust people that are always positive and upbeat 24/7. Now this is very normal behavior with acquaintances or people you don’t know very well. That’s understandable. You are exchanging casual conversation and don’t really need to know personal details about their lives. Therefore they keep it friendly. However, with people that you consider friends, family and people you genuinely care for, you would expect to see all of their emotions. You would want to celebrate their accomplishments with them. Be there for them, when they are sad and upset. To know them on a personal level. But there  

Compliment fishing Compliment fishing is when a person manipulates others into giving them validation and overall positive feedback by being unable to handle constructive criticism and by being insecure and self-deprecating (sometimes unconsciously, but often times on purpose) about the thing they are sharing with or asking of others. For example: They may share their art or pictures of them online or offline, saying how much their piece of art sucks or how ugly they are, despite knowing they are talented artists and not ugly at all. However, since people often fall for this manipulative behavio 

My ex tried to manipulate by pretending he was doing me a favour when really, he was just trying to benefit himself. Instead of saying he didn't want to do something, he’d turn it so that it looked like I was benefiting from his ‘consideration'. This technique also works to make you feel guilty. Some very minor examples…I wanted to see him but he'd say things like “I know you're tired, I'll let you rest and see you later in the week" or “I know I haven't see you all week but I'm tired and it wouldn't be fair on you if I just fall asleep". If you say you don't mind him falling asleep you'd just  

This is a true story. — What do you see in this picture ? If you are like 99% of people I know, you may interpret this picture as a feel-good picture of a man cracking jokes with tourists. This is Rome. A city that looks and feels like a living museum. Every street corner seems to have a historic monument. It’s an amazing and enchanting place!  External Image Source: Getting Scammed in Europe! And, you are right. In fact, he is not only cracking jokes with them, he is offering them free gifts - bracelets and trinkets - gifts that he is going to give away to the tourists as a show of kindness. You ref 

Oh, boy, do I have some stories to tell you about manipulative/(not-cunning) behavior and all about one person, LOL. I met this person at my university where we were in the same program together. I met her after a while in the program, and it was a big, fat mistake. She would ask for favors from certain people, and she would do it from a select group of people (and sometimes new, unaware victims). She and I became “friends” when she got my contact information (siiiigghh) and hit me up one day to “hang out.” It was very out of the blue because there is hardly anyone in my life that contacts me.  

I know exactly what manipulative, cunning behavior wrapped up in “nice”, and tied up neatly with a bow looks like. It’s exactly what ended a sixteen-year-long friendship between myself and one of my best friends. We’ll call her Jessica. (Yes, we’re definitely going to call her Jessica because, well, that’s her real name, and I don’t really give a flying f*ck at the moment.) In our mid-twenties, I had to distance myself from Jessica for a few years because she was heavily drinking, partying, taking drugs, sleeping with a different guy every night, and couldn’t hold down a decent job. She was wakin 

I had a supervisor/ colleague who fit this description. Buying junk food/snacks constantly without really even asking if I wanted it. Some of them were from expensive bakery shops so I’d feel bad if I didn’t eat it. Offering to help with a task or some problem I am going through but guilt tripping me if I found the solution before she could. For example, for some reason she really didn’t like me talking to human resources. There was no logical reason for it, she just didn’t want me speaking to them even though there were no issues and it was not infringing on any company policy. She would argue  

If someone offers to help ( give food/ money/ anything) but with very specific selfish expectations, it is not a help or nice behavior - it is manipulative business transaction ( A sign of cunning behaviour) For example, let’s call her Aunt X. Aunt X was not a mean person but had very less empathy and tolerance for any situation that causes her discomfort. She was pretty selfish. But she was smart - she knew when there is a disagreement whether property issues or any general issue, there is no use of fighting/ yelling. That makes people defensive and cautious. It is easier to pretend to be an a 

I had a ‘friend.’ We met in sixth grade due to peewee soccer. we only hung out during soccer practise at this time, so I didn’t feel like she was a bad friend because we weren’t really close. Seventh grade comes around. I lose my bff from sixth grade (not the manipulative one.) due to her moving schools, and I now have all my classes with manipulative girl. We will call her Susan. Susan has her own group of friends, I am not friends w any of them, but we all eat lunch together. Susan only wants to hang out with me when her friends either aren’t at school or are for some reason talking to someon 

Allow me to highlight a rather mild and subtle example that usually goes unnoticed until it’s too late. I notice this a lot in the business world. My boss likes to give me gifts: a wrist watch here, a wallet there, an invitation to hang out (despite a 30-year age gap), and persists even though I clearly express my discomfort in receiving these. He also loves to promise a lot of stuff that doesn’t really materialize. At this point anything I take is out of politeness rather than any satisfaction the gift itself provides. It didn’t take me long to realize that it’s an investment as much as it is  

Who were the meanest people you ever met?
A teacher in my college. The teacher, was my old communication/IT teacher. He didn't care about anyone getting an education. He cared about getting as much money as possible, doing as little work as possible. I didn't realise this when I chose the communication/IT classes as my specialty. He would start classes talking about whatever passed his mind, leave after twenty minutes to get coffee and not come back for another half hour. Ultimate blow off class? Perhaps, but he also humiliated students. He'd spend entire lessons talking about how lazy a student was and how they wouldn't amount to anythi 

I had gone to my cousin's place once, and we had to go buy something from a shop nearby. We decided to walk. So we're walking together along the road, and there's this guy who's riding a bicycle. He's attempting to perform some stunt to impress God-knows-who, and at a certain considerable speed he comes dangerously close to hitting me. I reflexively jumped aside, and he goes past me. Then I turn behind to give him a piece of my mind; as there's a responsible way of riding. At the same time, this guy too is giving me a look, as if it was my fault!I decided to let this pass and continued walking 

Kids. I’ve met quite a few mean adults as well but even the worst of them were angels compared to some kids I came across when I was no more than 6. Child abuse in most people’s minds is related to adults abusing children, within or outside the close family circle. We all are aware of this and the damages it causes. But what about young children abusing both physically and verbally children of the same age? I went through this almost all the way through elementary school. I can’t remember how it began. I remember my classmates pushing me down the stairs, calling me names, laughing at me, threatening 

I feel bad for shaming my own family but it is what it is. We all have good sides and bad sides. It could be more rude or inappropriate than mean, but what do you call a family that doesn't make you feel like you are part of it? My mom moved to the US and brought me and my brother here for education. My uncle (my mom’s brother-in-law) sponsored my mom’s work permit. My mom eventually got a green card and brought us over. As I was growing up, either my aunt or my uncle had to pick me up from school. My mom was stuck at work and she didn't have any sense of direction except knowing how to drive f 

In middle school I was bullied by so many kids mostly by a girl called Vanessa (fake name). I was 13 &amp; she was 14 back in 2014. Looking at it now she looks like this dude:  I was a very small 4’11 &amp; 95lb girl meanwhile Vanessa was a 5’6 200lb girl. She would constantly bully me for no reason. She assembled an entourage of ppl who would laugh at me whenever she would make mean comments to me. She would always tell me I’m ugly &amp; how much she hated me. It even got physical where she yanked my hair &amp; I fell back. Everyone started laughing at me. A few months later my friend named John posted a pic of 

Now I’m not really old, so this might not seem a bit mean to you adults but I think it’s mean. I used to go to one of those international schools in Hong Kong. International schools in Hong Kong were basically filled with snobby rich kids or expats. Culture was also a lot crueler, a lot of it came with the wealth that was behind the students and bullying was everywhere. I was bullied but I also had my really good friends so it didn’t really bother me though it did push me to the edge quite a few times. Many years went by and came seventh grade. It was very normal for students to go study abroa 

My older sister: We are estranged now. My mom has MS and is on disability, and my dad works so much to help pay for everything (bills, insurance, etc.). So both parents were physically there but also not really there at the same time since they were dealing with their own issues. My older sister kind of filled in the “mom” role. She resented my mom for being sick. She also resented me for just existing. I grew up with physical abuse from her when I was really young (I remember her kicking my back and in the winter she smashed a big block of icy snow over my head, she also learned I was scared o 

As someone who recently left secondary school (that's what we call the school teenagers go to between the ages of 12-13 and 16-17 here), I haven't much experience in life, but I can say this would be the meanest thing someone has ever done to me. In year 2 of primary school, I made two good friends, A and B, from my own class. We stayed friends for the rest of the year and evidently sort-of promised to keep our friendship alive through the following year. However, my primary school's custom is to mix up the students and sort them according to academic achievement, so A and I ended up in the top 

I went to highschool with a guy named David*. David was just mean and mad all the time. The bus would pick him up in the morning, and he would get on with his headphones on, sit in a seat, and stare out the window the entire time. The rest of us would be rowdy school kids, and he'd be so quiet until we'd not even really notice him after he got on. It wasn't until one day during our sophomore year, one of my best friends questioned about how he was so quiet, and was probably a really nice guy if someone would just be nice and talked to him. So she tried. The next time we saw him in the hallway, 

I had pulled through a parking space, about the 15th from the end of a row, because the car I was driving would not go in reverse at the time. The car is an antique- over thirty-five years old. It was to go in the shop a few days before, but, my car was in the shop, completely undrivable. My car wouldn't go over 30 mph, then turn off, so it had to be towed in. That's why I was driving my father's antique, that he inherited from my Grandmother. A car was turning onto the row, when I was turning my car off. The driver blocked me in. Then, her passenger jumped out and immediately started calling m 

Do short people feel uncomfortable around tall people?
Yes, it’s just awkward having to look up to people all the time, and then there are other bizarre incidents that spawn from being short. I never knew I was short until I was about 16. That’s because prior to that, I hadn’t been short. I stopped growing around age 11 and became short. Once, when I was at school, some girls were talking about how they felt about their height. I opened my mouth and was about to say I was satisfied with my height, when they all spoke in unison. “Don’t worry, you’ll grow. You still have time.” I shut my mouth, confused. I’d had no idea I was short up until that momen 

NOT AT ALL! In fact, I wish I was shorter than I am as I am going through a body phase at the moment. I suppose you can say “quarter-life crisis” as I have been isolated and unloved due to society and being a Gay Guy that's on the feminine side. Usually, I would stand at 5′6 since my mom is slightly shorter than 5′4 due to her reaching middle age so I would consider myself 5′5 as we look just about the same height. What I find it interesting is some of the guys where I'm from (Phoenix AZ), are a couple inches shorter than me like they are between 5′2-5′3 and sorta feel a little uneasy as I envy t 

I'm 5'2″. Being on the teetering edge of being called short, I guess I can answer this question.  Hell no! I don't feel uncomfortable around tall people. (Trust me, majority of my cousins and friends average at 6ft.)  I have to agree that it's a huge inconvenience when tall guys ( constituting 70%) sit in front of me in classes. I have to crane my neck around them, twist my body this way and that to see the screen and my professor. I guess I might appear to be doing the nagini dance to the ones behind me. And don't even get me started on the lower half of the screen. Hours of yoga especially to to 

I’m five one, and I do often feel uncomfortable around tall people. It depends on the situation. Most of the time I don’t notice that I am smaller than other people. SO many times in my life I’ve gotten pictures back and realize, whoa, I’m like this miniature stranger in the middle of all of these perfect looking people :/ I don’t necessarily realize I’m so much shorter than others until I see photographic evidence.But, times I feel awkward:When I am the only short person I sometimes feel like a child around adults. When I am a lot shorter than someone and we are standing I feel like talking 

Obviously I can’t speak for all short people, but I certainly do, at times. More so women than men. Like, every single guy in my hometown is taller than 180 cm, my height, so I mostly don’t even notice that anymore. I ONLY notice when an adult male is actually shorter than me! Not my height, but a good three inches/7.5 cm shorter than me. Then I go, “Hey neat! It’s another me! Low five!” But usually, it’s the tall women that make me uncomfortable. Not for anything they’re doing, but because I utterly loathe and despise my own height, because of the aforementioned shortness aspect of it. While a 

I will be speaking from my perspective and perspectives along with experiences differ from person to person, so it will not be a general answer. Sometimes, yes, it can get a little uncomfortable. I will come to that in a few. However, most of the time, it's quite okay being short. As a 4′10″ person (who used to vehemently believe she was a solid 5′ until it was rechecked), I would say that being short has both advantages and disadvantages and I've come to happily live with that fact. It can get uncomfortable in crowds, where most people are taller than you. It's in human nature to ignore that whi 

Do you know this girl -  Yes !!! She is jyoti Amge, 24yr old Indian woman, height 2 feet 7 inches!!!!!!!!! She was born on 16 december 1993 in Nagpur, maharashtra, India. And yes she is world's shortest woman. Holding Guinness book of world record.Her wax statue is also present in Celebrity Wax Museum, Lonavala.   She was a regular school going with plenty number of friends.  Following Amge's 18th birthday on 21 December 2011, she was officially declared the world's smallest woman by Guinness World Records with a height of 62.8 centimetres (2 ft 0.6 in). Her restricted height is due to a growth abnormal 

Let’s see, I’m 5′4″ and that’s simply the way it is, I don’t feel uncomfortable around people taller than me, it’d be a lot of discomfort if I did. I generally don’t think about it. Now, on the flip side, pretty much every woman I’ve hung with who isn’t related, has been taller than I, some much taller. One funny experience was when on a trip, I wound up with my buddy’s sister in law, wandering through a city in Canada, and there I was, fat, balding middle aged guy, dressing and looking my budget, walking with flowing haired green eyed 5′10″ 18 year old with flowing red hair, a bay watch body,  

 I’m a 5’4” male and my wife is a 6’1” female. We’ve been married over 10 years, have a 9 year old daughter and we’re all very happy. I’m originally from the UK and she’s an American, not sure if this makes a difference? We used to notice the giggles in restaurants etc, especially when she wore high heels (which I love her to wear!) But I think we’re used to it now and don’t notice. I obviously don’t feel uncomfortable around tall people and probably 90% of the US population are taller than I am! I firmly believed that when my wife and I had a child that he or she would be of average height, you kn 

 Previous studies have identified a genetic correllation between height and IQ using twins and family members, but this study was the first to test the connection using DNA markers in unrelated people, study author Riccardo Marioni told Britain's Sunday Times. Researchers analyzed genetic data on 6,815 men and women collected by the Scottish Family Health Study between 2006 and 2011. "We tested whether DNA-based genetic similarities among people related to their similarities in height and intelligence," Marioni said. "What we found was a small association between height and intelligence such that 

Why are people calling empaths ‘unaware narcissists’?
Someone would call an empath an unaware narcissist if they do not understand empathy. Usually it will be a narcissist doing this to deflect from their own NPD and blame the victim. Empaths are usually always the targets of abusers. The abusive, hateful and emotionally stunted types hate those with empathy with a fiery passion. In my experience, an empath is not so much the opposite of a narcissist, although you could say that. I consider empaths the opposite of a psychopath. One cannot feel empathy at all, the other is gifted with empathy. It is a gift. A gift that, like many of the gifts comes 

Maybe my story can answer why people are calling empaths 'unaware narcissists'. Beware anytime that someone who is not a licensed mental health professional tries to label you with any mental disorder! For most of my first marriage, my wife would always abuse me emotionally and accuse me of being too sensitive emotionally when I discussed her negative behavior with her. I was labelled as bipolar, borderline, and a plethora of other psychological disorders by her. She's a RN so I started believing her.

Like John Coctostan has already stated, I wouldn’t state it as empaths being unaware narcissists. However, I am able to see the incredible lack of empathy by people proclaiming to be empaths. It’s actually quite funny. I have a ton of screenshots about people sending me death threats, telling me to kill myself, and telling me that I’m not human. The latter two happened this week 3 times. One individual who specifically has the empath label in their Quora bio told me If you have a mental illness, I cannot treat you like a human being. That would be insulting to you because you are not one. Would  

Because they don’t understand what a narcissist or an empath truly is. People misuse both of these terms all of the time. And I don’t fault anyone for it, but I will try to offer what clarity I can. A narcissist is a person with a clinically diagnosable personality disorder. This disorder stems from a deeply traumatic core wounding of the ego that typically takes place during childhood and results in the ego working overtime to protect itself from further damage. Unfortunately, the term “narcissist” is commonly bandied about and synonymously applied to those who are merely egotistical, vain, co 

Self identified empaths sit there and talk about how they’re always doing everything right and how it’s everyone around that’s causing them problem. They go on and on about how eternally kind they are and how everyone else is a narcissistic vampire.If you challenge their opinions, they turn from an “empath” into an aggressive ass, constantly calling you a narcissist for a simple disagreement and excuse their incapability to control themselves by saying they have an extremely “sensitive nature”.If you have heightened empathy which was something I dealt with as a younger kid and something I abso

Empaths are unaware narcissits because they have empathy and they can make other person feel happy by understanding them and sacrificing their own happiness if needed. Wow what a abuse I have done?? Yeah when we feel love we can connect to other person soul and coming close to someone’s heart. Wow another emotional abuse We want dedication,commitment and loyalty in partner as we see you as soulmate and want to spend life together happily. Sounds abuse????? I love you so I will understand you and I will allow you to take your anger on me because if that makes you chilled down and I will even apologis 

Having narcissistic qualities and being a Narcissist are two totally different things. As humans , most people have some type of narcissism , egocentricity or lack empathy somewhere. I feel that many people who call themselves empaths might sometimes fall into an Ego trap but that does not make them a narcissist . True narcissists are abusive, hurtful, lack remorse and lack a lot of empathy. Again, Someone calling themselves an Empath might sometimes fall into an ego trap but they do not have the qualities of someone with NPD. As someone who also dated a narcissist, in one of the answers here  

as someone who feels things very deeply, I have always been skeptical of others who label themselves as empaths and use that label as a badge of pride. Often, they talk about this ‘ability’ as if it were a gift. I think that anyone who feels intense emotions, particularly feeling the emotions of others uncontrollably, would know that this is not something that you need to be proud of or pat yourself on the back for, because often times, it is more of a curse than a blessing. Most people function without a deep understanding of themselves, and are therefore oblivious to the effect that they hav 

There are a couple of reasons to be called an unaware narcissistic. 1. Self deception. Empaths will uplift and make others happy. They believe that they are the only ones that know what’s best for the narcissistic and can help make he/she into a genuine loving person. That is called pride. Pride is a major blind spot in seeing the big picture. 2. Exaggerated sense of self importance. As an intuitive empath, there is a tendency to know what is best for others and then set about showing the other or others what to do and how to live. A sure way to push people away. It’s great to be intuitive a 

The 50 shades of narcissism : They wore masks, they kept it there, they need their needs, they daydream about the perfect everything, and everything is bullshit a holy crap, nothing is real, it's all anxiety rushes, intensity craving, great expectation, and false images about the perfect everything, meanwhile the only perfect thing is their **unawareness &amp; their **personality disorder. **The seduction and the manipulation** : the prince charming or the lady queen** will show, **but in contrast for that they are insecure and frightened even if they were successful in this role, they do not have th 

Will the narcissist ever reap what he sowed? He’s flashing his new supply around but abused me in every possible way, lied and disappeared. Will he pay?
He's been paying his whole life and he'll continue paying until the day he dies. Narcs spend their lives engulfed in misery, shame, fear, and mental exhaustion. Why do you care what he's showing the rest of the world? You know who he REALLY is. I'm sure he was showing the world that same fake face when he was with you too but you know exactly what was going on behind the scenes. Stop comparing yourself to the new supply. Neither of you are better than the other. Do you know why? BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU. It's always about the narc and protecting their own fragility. The older they get, the w 

They are very very good at shedding their decrepit self, and starting all new and afresh. Coming out smelling like flowers. I noticed my narcissist ex went on a throw away spree. Bought a whole new wardrobe. Threw away all his old cloth, furniture, and about everything else. He bought tons of new toys for himself, and went on tropical vacations with his boyfriends, and other get away trips. He arrived at my house with a giant moving truck. And left/moved out with a small thing to pull behind his car. That’s how desperate he was to get rid of all negative feelings he had put on himself through our  

You can spend the rest of your natural life cursing the narcissist or you can take responsibility of your own part in what happens, learn from it and come out better. How can he still abuse, lie and disappear? Are you still together? If you are, then you need to walk away. Stat! Flashing his new supply is his prerogative. That is something you have no control over. You can't tell him to stop, but you don't have to subject yourself to his ego tripping complex. Where does he flash his new supply? If it's on social media, then delete, block, unfriend, unfollow. Put as much distance as possible betw 

Narcissists are good at showing you only the good parts of their life,but every day you aren’t witness to their life slowly crumbling away is what they are afraid of showing you. 1.You know they are only good at being actors pretending to be happy,but are empty inside like hollow shells wearing a mask. 2.They want to make you jealous and envious that they are doing all these fun activities without you using other peoples’ money to enjoy life,but it’s a matter of time before the mask drops and those people choose to either leave or stay. 3. When they get older it’s much harder to gain favor and 

He's paying everyday and will be for the rest of his life. Deep down he knows he just ain't got what it takes. As for ‘flashing the new supply around’ who the fuck does he think he's fooling? I tell you who, no one! least of all himself. What did Shakespeare say, “methinks my lady doth protest too much”. Its a diversion, a distraction and a delusion. He's scared he has become and is becoming irrelevant to you. So what's he do? , he tries to get your attention and his Flying Monkeys by saying “look at me, I don't need you, I'm a winner”. And it's a complete load of bs. He lost you and it hurts  

What you are wanting is for the person whom hurt you to hurt, and feel the hurt that you felt. A sort of justice. Your DESIRE is justified. Your natural belief that they deserve some equal or reasonable punishment is as human as it gets. And that's as far as it goes, regarding reality. You're wanting a person whom developed an inability to experience or value the things that you do, to feel how you do while being in some way exploited, mistreated, or otherwise unfairly affected. I'd expound, but it should click at this point what I'm getting at. Do you value the things you value to the degree that y 

You’re just looking at the shell of man that fakes everything. Tap on his head and you’ll hear a hollow sound inside, just kidding but narcs have a vast emptiness in them but their mask displays it differently. Narcs day is coming especially as they age because they can fake how they feel and they can fake how you perceive them but they can’t fake all of their destructive behavior towards those who care about them. Those evil deeds come back to haunt narc like a tax evader being caught by the IRS. Narcs can only fool a certain crowd for so long until they move on to other superficial friends and 

No he won't pay. Ever. Not in the way you want him to. He doesn't care. He has no real feelings. He lives in a fantasy world. Constantly. In other words, you must stop thinking about revenge or karma. You must focus on you and move on with your life. Make yourself better because no one else will. It's up to you. Focus on you not him. You'll never get better by focusing on the past. I know this isn't easy but you have to do this. Seek help from professional counseling, reading books or articles on the subject of narcissism and talk to that one good person in your life who will listen. You can't c 

Let me tell you that they pay each &amp; every day. You will heal &amp; go on to live a full life experiencing love, friendship, passion, commitment. Your XNarc will NEVER know any of these feelings. The pwNPD is an empty vessel. They cannot feel empathy or truly experience love…not even with their children. They are completely fake &amp; that’s why they behave as they do. They cannot even truly feel when they hurt us. Be grateful that you are not him. You will hurt but heal.

The pattern with unethical people regardless of this specific circumstance is that they eventually piss off people that are really powerful, and perhaps have few ethical qualms themselves. Do not worry about this. There was a tale of a serial killer called the ice cream killer who went around the country killing people via poisoning their ice cream. He befriended someone called the ‘ice man’ who was just a soulless mercenary. They were good friends until they got in an argument about a complete irrelevance and the ice cream killer ended up six feet under. 178 views · View upvotes4Angelica Amos, BEd, Dip Teach. 59 years old , self taught narc expert.Updated 1 year ago · Author has 1.7K answers and 176.1K answer views

What are 10 things you should do to protect yourself from a narcissist?
When you began to wake up to reality of the narcissist and the abuse, what was your reaction? Did you go into a rage? Then ended up looking out of your mind crazy cuz everything they've done surfaced and came out like an explosion? 
What surprises a narcissist?
To understand what surprises a narcissist, it's really important that you understand what makes a narcissist tick to begin with. Remember that the narcissist’s childhood caused them to believe that in order to survive, they must manipulate, lie, and hurt others to control the outcome of their lives and to gain a sense of inner value. If you are an empath, it’s important to remember that you cannot help this person. You cannot save them or make them better. Narcissists can't truly be rehabilitated.There's nothing that can be done to actually teach them how to love, have compassion, or have empa 

Everything or anything you do that is counter to what they want. There are 2 kinds of surprises. The one that makes us say “what a nice surprise!” And the one that makes us say “what the f@&amp;$!” You’ll never get the first one if you’re the main supply and they’ve moved away from the Love Bombing Stage and they are getting negative supply from you. I did my homework, intensely researched ways to get a narcissist to give me the reaction that I want, either the one that makes me feel appreciated or the one that gives me the satisfaction of revenge. I found nothing. Except…clarity. 1. Get to know a 

I’m going down a different path with this answer. Trying to take the high road, so to speak. My very own NPD is surprised by unconditional love. Since its not in his bag of tools, he can’t imagine love without ifs, ands or buts. He is genuinely surprised by unexpected kindness. I made a pact either with God or the devil, I’m not sure, to have a relationship where I love unconditionally. It is inextricably made doubly challenging in that we are in a Dom/sub relationship. My lack of shock surprises him. He is surprising himself too. He is currently undergoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and lea 

Hello Steve, I discovered something very amazing, and quite wonderful around 18 months ago. Prior to this, I had been having a cyber relationship with someone whom exhibited narcistic tendencies. This cyber relationship also consisted of cybersex, which at the time, was a new phenomenon to me. During the length of time that I took part in this relationship, around twelve months, I was subjected to tantrums, long periods of silence, plus being insulted, and expected to be on hand on my end of the computer despite a five hour time zone difference. I eventually sent a final email which exited my wi

When you figure out they are a loser. When you acknowledge Narcissists are the biggest, complete and total losers ever possible, you realize how unworthy they are to be present in your life. You realize that their word means nothing. And yes, they'll keep saying bad shit, but it's all coming from a loser. The difference is now your expectations are set accordingly. You understand they'll always be the biggest loser, and there's no reason to react to their pathetic attempts at making you feel bad. Because NOW YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO CARE ABOUT SOME LOSER WHOSE ONLY GOAL IS TO MAKE YOU A BIGGER LOSER 

Oooh, I love this question because I know the answer. I’ve lived to find out the answer firsthand. Rebecca Zung is right. The narcissist is blindsided when you finally dump his ass and go no-contact. He knew without a doubt he had you so trauma-bonded, wrapped around his finger so tight, that you weren’t going anywhere. At first he’ll think it’s a little game: “So cute!!! She is mad so she has to punish me, lol. She’s so stupid. She’ll be back with her little suitcase in the morning, probably still pouting. I’ll play her game for a little while. But I WILL put her back in her place. How dare tha 

I recently answered a question on “good habits to practice to scare narcs away”, and I think the essence of that answer is important here. This is because the things you do to scare a narcissist away are the very same things that surprise them. Things to practice to surprise a narc/ scare them away: It is good to practice the habit of avoidance and ignoring, which is helpful when dealing with toxic people. If someone is condescending to you, tries to belittle or demean you… or triangulate you, don't give any emotional response. Don't let the (subtle) emotional jabs at your psyche affect you. Even  

Being proven wrong when they “think” they’re always right. The second ex is a prime example of thinking she’s right, and proven wrong. Every time she opens that mouth, she removes all doubt. What really surprises them, is too see you’ve moved on with your life. And that you’re so much happier without them anywhere near you. When you can literally laugh at what they say. When you’re happier with someone else, and living a life they can’t be part of anymore. Jealousy is what they use in relationships too break you, and they’re the ones getting broken by it. They’re also surprised when you leave th

What does a narcissist do at the end of a relationship?
This is long, but it is the cold truth and what the end looks like. Every time. Every bond. Every “these people don't know us, that won't happen to me.” I will admit, I was that person. This isn't even the worst from what I have read, and it just happened, so only time will tell how much worse it gets. To start, there was no relationship and most of these things have been going on or at the very least, have been being carefully knit together, in advance. At the end is where the claws come out and it only becomes obvious that they are already inches deep inside of you, when you finally attempt  

In my experience what they do at the very end of a relationship kind of depends on what happened between you two towards or at the end. There are only 3 real ways a relationship with a true narcissist will end. The first is if you go all the way through the cycle, the devalue stage and then they discard you after they are totally bored with you which is most common and how most of them end! The second is if you happen to discard them at the very beginning of the devaluing stage or right before which was my case. The third is if you are able to expose them to their family, kids, flying monkeys or  

At the end of a relationship with a Narcissist, several things may happen. 1. They will discard you without a thought, and then blame the break up on you for being the problem, when we all know that it is they, who really have the issue. 2. If YOU discard the Narcissist, be prepared for things to turn very nasty extremely quickly. The number one ‘no no’ to do to a Narcissist is to wound their ego. By dumping them, you have done just that. Depending on what type of narc you’re dealing with, makes all the difference. A covert narc will try to gain support from others, trash you, and gang up on y 

Firstly, it was not a relationship. It was a parasitic and sedicious transfusion of life energy. What did the narc do at the end of this arrangement in which I was unwittingly taking part in? Well, first she ghosted me, blocked everywhere, no responses to emails. I gave up after 3 email attempts. Then she made sure a mutual friend on FB (flying monkey) posted pics of her and new supply having a good time at what I thought was 'our’ special place. This was a few days post discard. I promptly unfriended all known monkeys at this point. They are as disgusting and insipid as the narc. Being ghosted an 

I can’t speak to this topic generally, but I’ll share my experience of having ended a relationship with a malignant narcissist. When I ended a relationship with a malignant narcissist, nothing really happened. We cut all contact and I didn’t hear from him or contact him for years. I didn’t miss him AT ALL, and parts of my life that had been stunted, like my relationship goals or my career started to really flourish in his absence. I thought he was gone forever until …. I got engaged to the man of my dreams - my now husband. A few months before my wedding, the malignant narcissist called me and le 

When their prey has lost it’s use and value in the narcs life, they will start showing their true colors. They will continually do mental subjugation, make you feel like you are just a waste of space, unworthy, useless. They will continue to brain wash and abuse the prey which then makes them do whatever is asked of them. The Narc will continue to be so horrible and hateful and yet the prey will love her even more. Then just out of the blue, with no provocation or issues will just dump their prey in the most humiliating way possible. And yet the prey will do everything to win back the Narc and 

In my experience, and it would seem the experience of many others, a narcissist will reveal her or his true colors at the end of the relationship. With a shock, you realize you were never a person who was loved and cherished, rather you were a mere source of supply for someone incapable of any real love, except for herself. In hindsight you suspect you knew this all along, but you didn’t want to admit to it. It makes no difference how well you conducted your part of the relationship, you will be made to know it was never good enough for the narcissist. You hope things can still be worked out be

They do the best thing they have ever done for you. They make it impossible for you to ever be around them ever again. It’s a long and brutal fall from the pedestal to reality.

Do you want to survive and live or do you want the pain and this very sick individual to win by your complete demise? Are they worth it? Is your ultimate sacrifice worth it? You are not all consumed.

When will the empath walk away from a narcissist?
When will the abused Empath walk away from a Pathological/Malignant Narcissist? This will often require a type of ‘Awakening’ within the Empath, helped often by the deteriorating behaviour of the abuser. It’s important to remember that many victims of these Cluster B abusers become Trauma Bonded to their abuser; often the victim is already traumatised from (for instance) Familial abuse, and they have then moved on to a ‘Romantic’ relationship that mirrors what they have grown up with. It’s really a sort of Co Dependency between both parties. This is not to excuse or lessen the often malevolent  

When will the empath walk away from a narcissist? First, I won’t qualify myself as an empath. I will just say that I have empathy and lots of compassion for others thoughts and feelings. You can kind of judge your own qualities of empathy by how others view you. If you often hear other people say to you, “If that would have been me, then I would of done this, that, or the other. I don’t see how you handled it so gracefully, calmly, intelligently, peacefully, etc.” If you’ve heard that more than a few times from others then you probably have a lot of patience and compassion than the average pers 

Yes, the empath will walk away!!! The probability is low, but it can happen. And when the empath truly walks, the Narc is stunned, truly stunned! I’m defining “walk away” as completely walking away from emotional connectedness. This goes beyond “zero contact” because the empath has truly moved on and the Narc is now just like a random cashier at a grocery store that’s bypassed for a different line. The rest of the answer has two parts: What causes the empath to walk away and What keeps the empath from being Hoovered back. Walk Away: The Empath has realized that their emotions need time to work  

An empath will walk away from a narcissist when and only when they have a sufficiently good Victim Story. “Empaths” are in fact covert narcissists, and the narcissists they go out with are in fact psychopaths. Empathic Personality Disorder, due to hit the shelves in the DSM-6, is the condition where a particular type of covert narcissist exclusively dates psychopaths. As part of their magical thinking, the narcissist likes to imagine they are deeply compassionate, empathetic, caring and kind. In comparison to a psychopath, perhaps they are. You probably wondered why Empaths only ever seem sympath 

Many empaths are also hsps (highly sensitive people) and infjs in the myer briggs personality type which makes them the rarest personality in the world. The ability for us to feel true empathy transcends what most people can understand. People don't understand extreme empathy (some call it malignant empathy when your desire to cure exceeds what the other person even wants themselves) especially when those close to us is suffering it makes us feel literally close to exactly what they are feeling. Through the projection we end up taking on the narcissists agony and deranged disorder. It is litera 

It will take some time- a lot more than you would want to waste. The whole thing is that it isn’t a waste of time at all. It is needed time. Time does not only heal but it fixes things , helps you see things more clearly. I am happy to say that I walked away. They are so predictable that it is easy to know what they are up to and play out in your head what they are going to do next. For me this made it easier well it helped anyways. Empathy will walk away when they are truely truely fed up with their life and anything that they stand for. This will be unfortunately after they have been way past  

I just realized I was a empath and light worker. I just thought I had a weirdo magnet and that's why people attached them self to me. I have lost everything do to not understanding what being a empath and light worker is. I am learning to love myself. Yet I let others needs stop from taking care of my own. I am a loner really bad. I know people but have not allowed closeness. I explain how I am honest to a fault. That I will tolerate peoples mean and cold behaviors. I lost man that showed me that I was different. He helped me learn how to protect myself. He showed me love loyalty and compassio 

It will take time for the empath to realize what a grave situation they have put themselves in. The realization that their heart will not be mend by the person they fall in love is the realization that needs to be made before it’s too late. My experience with one of them is that they never take responsibility of their own actions, they would just find things or create the situation to make you believe that it’s your fault, and somewhere you are entirely responsible. They create an image of you in the head and keep feeding you with the thoughts they have about you till you believe that you’re exa 

Sadly it depends on the type of empath it is. There are different Classes of narcissist (as if it couldn’t get worse) and different types of empaths. For some people it takes heart break after heart break until they are too broken to continue the “relationship”. They will walk away when they have giving so much of themselves, have nothing left, gave more than they had and are in debt with themselves. I walked away after almost 2 years. I kept giving him chance after chance after chance. Sad part was he never asked me for a second, third, fourth etc chance but I gave him more chances I could coun 

They usually don’t. They get discarded. And that’s when they learn the hellish depths of their devaluation. Empaths love the narcissist and believe they’re loved in return. They think they can help heal the narcissist, or take care of them, or somehow protect them from all those nasty people the narcissist is devaluing to the empath. When the narcissist discards the empath, it’s a foundational shock. When the empath learns that everything they’ve ever said or done has been twisted and turned against them, during a behind-their-back devaluation, it’s another foundational shock. It’s like every tim 

Do you miss the person you believed your narcissistic ex to be?
Shortly after I got married, in 1967, I realized I didn’t know the man I married. I thought “don’t worry he’ll change because that’s what we do when we get married and become responsible.” That didn’t change with him. He stayed irresponsible for at least the next 13 years. Even after having children, he stayed irresponsible. But I saw the potential in him, and he was a good provider. Somehow I managed to grow up fast after the marriage and took responsibility for more than my share. I thought he if just quits drinking he’ll be fine. Wrong!

I thought I saw so much good in him once The non stop little gifts and cards filled with love , making me chicken noodle soup when I was sick and tucking me in . Getting up in the middle of 

I used to do. I sure mourned for him for what felt like centuries! In fact, I think that's the biggest hurdle -- accepting that the person you loved so deeply doesn't exist, never existed, and ( hardest of all) never will. We can't love that fantasy person into existence. And even if we could, the guy walking around in his body doesn't want to become that guy. But guess what? I found something SO much better!

At the beginning yes, I missed him like crazy. My therapist really helped me, she said of course you do, you really loved who he pretended to be, and I did. That love was real and it takes time to heal from that loss and to top it off you have to accept that he wasn’t real and then conquer the healing from the betrayal. There are many pieces to the healing journey after this type of betrayal. It makes you question humanity, it makes you question your worth, it’s awful.

So I have many draft answers to other questions, but I really want to respond to this one. If I miss the person I dedicate my Q account to? So, short answer is NO. Long answer is NO, because I cannot miss someone who does not exists. Before I broke the trauma bond, I did miss him. The one he pretended to be, the one I saw during intermittent reinforcement moments. When I saw old pictures, I felt so much sadness, pity that he was so stupid for ruining things for ridiculous reasons, that it took nothing to kick me aside.

My Ex was the most wonderful, loving, caring, supportive person I had ever met, when it came to me nothing was to much for her and she made me happier than I can ever remember being, I felt so loved and so very lucky that she had chosen me to spend her life with me and I would have done anything for her, and did on occasion do some really bad things for her, nothing illegal I might add but I hurt family and friends so that we could be together, I gave her every part of me and in return she gave me every part of herself, or so I thought.

Yes. However, I remind myself that he never really existed. He was an actor playing the perfect role in my own life story, based on a script he wrote using details I had shared. And, that, only in the beginning, before he mixed my persona with others he was cheating with. He performed that role over and over again with others, after observing the effectiveness of his ability to convince me that he was real. He was never real, never really existed as a whole identity. It was all merely a great performance by a well-trained actor. Part of the reason it hurts so much is because they have stolen yo 

Yes and I hate it. He was really wonderful in the beginning, and that’s what hooked me in. Even as his NPD behavior started ramping up, there would be fun times here and there. I’d spend so much time dreaming about the future he painted for us, and preparing for it, and keeping my life on hold to have it one day. I miss the spontaneous nature of our relationship and being in the company of someone who was so strong and manly. But then it all fades. There were fun times “here and there” but I start to recall how short and far apart they were, and remember I spent most of my time alone and misera 

Why do narcissists seem to get away with it all, all of the time?
I'll take a stab at this and list a few reasons off of the top of my head. Narcissist's tend to get away with their toxic and abusive behavior because they're manipulative and often-times even charming. They will convince you that whatever they've done was your fault, twist the whole ordeal around, and in the end you'll be the one apologizing for something you didn't even do in the first place. Narcissists, from personal experience, will never truly admit any wrongdoing nor will they feel truly remorseful (but they will act like they are, all while pouring out crocodile tears, in order to manipu 

They get away most times .The times they don't ; ofoxurse noone learns Bout it .It's their personal injury which anyways they dissemble with a false facade and bravado and as though nothing touches them .like-” BaH!” They get away with their obnoxious behaviours because they are executing it perosnally one to one with the lady love in the privacy of their spaces .The social world isn't affected becasue they don't know a thang!! . Despite proclaiming love etc etc , their partners are deemed silly and stupid and gullible .After all, she believed all his dross and hears all his apocrpyhal stories w 

“Seem" is the operative word here. Nothing is ever as it appears for any of us and especially when it comes to pw narcissistic personality disorder! They work vigilantly to create the illusion of a perfect self, living a perfect life. They talk a good story and to those who don't know them well or only interact briefly with them, their assertions seems plausible. Its hard for normal people to imagine that anyone would fabricate and elaborate on the details of their life to the extent that the pw npd does if their narrative was untrue. More to the point is that people who have little interactio 

I have a soon-to-be ex-brother-in-law who is the classic narcissist, who wanted to have a child for the sole reason to keep my sister “looped in” to his sadistic game of psychological torture for eternity. He never takes accountability for anything, big or small, for the sake of his ego and pride, because they are #1 and #2 in his book. He has financially scammed my sister, who was the sole breadwinner for these years, lied to her about student loans, and tricked her into thinking that she wasn’t enough, treating her like a possession. But in all honesty, while it does indeed look like he’s “ge 

The short answer is because “the abusee” enables them. Every human being, consciously or subconsciously, teaches others how they are willing to be treated. You have taught the narcissist that you are willing to endure their abuse, to allow violations of your boundaries without repercussions/consequences, etc. Despite the awful things the narcissist has said or done, you are still involved with them. They keep pushing limits and testing boundaries to find your “breaking point”. You have taught the narcissist that they can treat you horribly and you won’t leave. This is the ultimate power trip a 

It sure seems like it from your perspective, but that’s because you’re the victim. And, remember, you’re hyper-fixated on the narcissist especially right after they leave you (and they know this) which is why they put on a show for you that they’re in no pain, they’ve forgotten all about you already, and they’ve moved on to bigger and better things. But here’s the truth. They don’t actually ‘get away with it’ all the time. Notice how people regularly cycle in and out of their life all the time. No one really stays for long. They can’t keep people. The people that get to know the ‘real them’ hav 

Get away with what exactly? Most narcissists aren’t on a mission to hurt others calculatingly (yes, I know there is exceptions), it just comes as a consequence of their emotional turmoil and you get caught in it. Also, karma doesn’t exist. If you kill an innocent person and get away with it, karma is likely never going to come. It’s superstitious nonsense. They get usually get away with unfavorable or immoral behavior because 1) people enable it 2) people don’t know when to leave them 3) they don’t know when to call for help 4) they’re doormats 5) They’re easily emotionally manipulated. Most peop 

Thank you for the A2A. In my experience, they manage to stay just under the radar. Remember, this is all like a game to them cause they have the social intelligence of a 5 year old.

Mine was very good at dodging the system.. like the IRS… hell mine didn’t file taxes for about 5 years!!! Cost him plenty of $$$$$, even though he got money back.

My mother was diagnosed as a narcissist very late in life but after talking to the psychiatrist (who refused quite rightly to talk in specific terms about my mother). He told my sisters and I that it is almost certain that people do not become narcissists, generally they grow up that way as its a result of nurture but nature has to be present as well. We, her children and grandchildren, talked long and hard about what to do as since my fathers death she had become almost intolerable. She could not move in with any of us as our marriages could not stand the strain and she refused to go to a reti

What do narcissists do in relationships?
Why are people calling empaths ‘unaware narcissists’?
Someone would call an empath an unaware narcissist if they do not understand empathy. Usually it will be a narcissist doing this to deflect from their own NPD and blame the victim. Empaths are usually always the targets of abusers. The abusive, hateful and emotionally stunted types hate those with empathy with a fiery passion. In my experience, an empath is not so much the opposite of a narcissist, although you could say that. I consider empaths the opposite of a psychopath. One cannot feel empathy at all, the other is gifted with empathy. It is a gift. A gift that, like many of the gifts comes 

Maybe my story can answer why people are calling empaths 'unaware narcissists'. Beware anytime that someone who is not a licensed mental health professional tries to label you with any mental disorder! For most of my first marriage, my wife would always abuse me emotionally and accuse me of being too sensitive emotionally when I discussed her negative behavior with her. I was labelled as bipolar, borderline, and a plethora of other psychological disorders by her. She's a RN so I started believing her. I was 'crazy’ and told so for many years by this seemingly competent and 'even keeled’ albeit e 

Like John Coctostan has already stated, I wouldn’t state it as empaths being unaware narcissists. However, I am able to see the incredible lack of empathy by people proclaiming to be empaths. It’s actually quite funny. I have a ton of screenshots about people sending me death threats, telling me to kill myself, and telling me that I’m not human. The latter two happened this week 3 times. One individual who specifically has the empath label in their Quora bio told me If you have a mental illness, I cannot treat you like a human being. That would be insulting to you because you are not one. Would  

Because they don’t understand what a narcissist or an empath truly is. People misuse both of these terms all of the time. And I don’t fault anyone for it, but I will try to offer what clarity I can. A narcissist is a person with a clinically diagnosable personality disorder. This disorder stems from a deeply traumatic core wounding of the ego that typically takes place during childhood and results in the ego working overtime to protect itself from further damage. Unfortunately, the term “narcissist” is commonly bandied about and synonymously applied to those who are merely egotistical, vain, co 

Self identified empaths sit there and talk about how they’re always doing everything right and how it’s everyone around that’s causing them problem. They go on and on about how eternally kind they are and how everyone else is a narcissistic vampire.If you challenge their opinions, they turn from an “empath” into an aggressive ass, constantly calling you a narcissist for a simple disagreement and excuse their incapability to control themselves by saying they have an extremely “sensitive nature”.If you have heightened empathy which was something I dealt with as a younger kid and something I abso

Empaths are unaware narcissits because they have empathy and they can make other person feel happy by understanding them and sacrificing their own happiness if needed. Wow what a abuse I have done?? Yeah when we feel love we can connect to other person soul and coming close to someone’s heart. Wow another emotional abuse We want dedication,commitment and loyalty in partner as we see you as soulmate and want to spend life together happily. Sounds abuse?????

Having narcissistic qualities and being a Narcissist are two totally different things. As humans , most people have some type of narcissism , egocentricity or lack empathy somewhere. I feel that many people who call themselves empaths might sometimes fall into an Ego trap but that does not make them a narcissist . True narcissists are abusive, hurtful, lack remorse and lack a lot of empathy. Again, Someone calling themselves an Empath might sometimes fall into an ego trap but they do not have the qualities of someone with NPD. As someone who also dated a narcissist, in one of the answers here  

as someone who feels things very deeply, I have always been skeptical of others who label themselves as empaths and use that label as a badge of pride. Often, they talk about this ‘ability’ as if it were a gift. I think that anyone who feels intense emotions, particularly feeling the emotions of others uncontrollably, would know that this is not something that you need to be proud of or pat yourself on the back for, because often times, it is more of a curse than a blessing. Most people function without a deep understanding of themselves, and are therefore oblivious to the effect that they hav 

There are a couple of reasons to be called an unaware narcissistic. 1. Self deception. Empaths will uplift and make others happy. They believe that they are the only ones that know what’s best for the narcissistic and can help make he/she into a genuine loving person. That is called pride. Pride is a major blind spot in seeing the big picture. 2. Exaggerated sense of self importance. As an intuitive empath, there is a tendency to know what is best for others and then set about showing the other or others what to do and how to live. A sure way to push people away. It’s great to be intuitive a

Will the narcissist ever reap what he sowed? He’s flashing his new supply around but abused me in every possible way, lied and disappeared. Will he pay?
He's been paying his whole life and he'll continue paying until the day he dies. Narcs spend their lives engulfed in misery, shame, fear, and mental exhaustion. Why do you care what he's showing the rest of the world? You know who he REALLY is. I'm sure he was showing the world that same fake face when he was with you too but you know exactly what was going on behind the scenes. Stop comparing yourself to the new supply. Neither of you are better than the other. Do you know why? BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU. It's always about the narc and protecting their own fragility. The older they get, the w 

They are very very good at shedding their decrepit self, and starting all new and afresh. Coming out smelling like flowers. I noticed my narcissist ex went on a throw away spree. Bought a whole new wardrobe. Threw away all his old cloth, furniture, and about everything else. He bought tons of new toys for himself, and went on tropical vacations with his boyfriends, and other get away trips. He arrived at my house with a giant moving truck. And left/moved out with a small thing to pull behind his car. That’s how desperate he was to get rid of all negative feelings he had put on himself through our  

You can spend the rest of your natural life cursing the narcissist or you can take responsibility of your own part in what happens, learn from it and come out better. How can he still abuse, lie and disappear? Are you still together? If you are, then you need to walk away. Stat! Flashing his new supply is his prerogative. That is something you have no control over. You can't tell him to stop, but you don't have to subject yourself to his ego tripping complex. Where does he flash his new supply? If it's on social media, then delete, block, unfriend, unfollow. Put as much distance as possible betw 

Narcissists are good at showing you only the good parts of their life,but every day you aren’t witness to their life slowly crumbling away is what they are afraid of showing you. 1.You know they are only good at being actors pretending to be happy,but are empty inside like hollow shells wearing a mask. 2.They want to make you jealous and envious that they are doing all these fun activities without you using other peoples’ money to enjoy life,but it’s a matter of time before the mask drops and those people choose to either leave or stay. 3. When they get older it’s much harder to gain favor and 

He's paying everyday and will be for the rest of his life. Deep down he knows he just ain't got what it takes. As for ‘flashing the new supply around’ who the fuck does he think he's fooling? I tell you who, no one! least of all himself. What did Shakespeare say, “methinks my lady doth protest too much”. Its a diversion, a distraction and a delusion. He's scared he has become and is becoming irrelevant to you. So what's he do? , he tries to get your attention and his Flying Monkeys by saying “look at me, I don't need you, I'm a winner”. And it's a complete load of bs. He lost you and it hurts  

What you are wanting is for the person whom hurt you to hurt, and feel the hurt that you felt. A sort of justice. Your DESIRE is justified. Your natural belief that they deserve some equal or reasonable punishment is as human as it gets. And that's as far as it goes, regarding reality. You're wanting a person whom developed an inability to experience or value the things that you do, to feel how you do while being in some way exploited, mistreated, or otherwise unfairly affected. I'd expound, but it should click at this point what I'm getting at. Do you value the things you value to the degree that y 

You’re just looking at the shell of man that fakes everything. Tap on his head and you’ll hear a hollow sound inside, just kidding but narcs have a vast emptiness in them but their mask displays it differently. Narcs day is coming especially as they age because they can fake how they feel and they can fake how you perceive them but they can’t fake all of their destructive behavior towards those who care about them. Those evil deeds come back to haunt narc like a tax evader being caught by the IRS. Narcs can only fool a certain crowd for so long until they move on to other superficial friends and 

No he won't pay. Ever. Not in the way you want him to. He doesn't care. He has no real feelings. He lives in a fantasy world. Constantly. In other words, you must stop thinking about revenge or karma. You must focus on you and move on with your life. Make yourself better because no one else will. It's up to you. Focus on you not him. You'll never get better by focusing on the past. I know this isn't easy but you have to do this. Seek help from professional counseling, reading books or articles on the subject of narcissism and talk to that one good person in your life who will listen. You can't c 

Let me tell you that they pay each &amp; every day. You will heal &amp; go on to live a full life experiencing love, friendship, passion, commitment. Your XNarc will NEVER know any of these feelings. The pwNPD is an empty vessel. They cannot feel empathy or truly experience love…not even with their children. They are completely fake &amp; that’s why they behave as they do. They cannot even truly feel when they hurt us. Be grateful that you are not him. You will hurt but heal.

The pattern with unethical people regardless of this specific circumstance is that they eventually piss off people that are really powerful, and perhaps have few ethical qualms themselves. Do not worry about this. There was a tale of a serial killer called the ice cream killer who went around the country killing people via poisoning their ice cream. He befriended someone called the ‘ice man’ who was just a soulless mercenary. They were good friends until they got in an argument about a complete irrelevance and the ice cream killer ended up six feet under. 178 views · View upvotes4Angelica Amos, BEd, Dip Teach. 59 years old , self taught narc expert.Updated 1 year ago · Author has 1.7K answers and 176.1K answer views

What surprises a narcissist?
To understand what surprises a narcissist, it's really important that you understand what makes a narcissist tick to begin with. Remember that the narcissist’s childhood caused them to believe that in order to survive, they must manipulate, lie, and hurt others to control the outcome of their lives and to gain a sense of inner value. If you are an empath, it’s important to remember that you cannot help this person. You cannot save them or make them better. Narcissists can't truly be rehabilitated.There's nothing that can be done to actually teach them how to love, have compassion, or have empa 

Everything or anything you do that is counter to what they want. There are 2 kinds of surprises. The one that makes us say “what a nice surprise!” And the one that makes us say “what the f@&amp;$!” You’ll never get the first one if you’re the main supply and they’ve moved away from the Love Bombing Stage and they are getting negative supply from you.

I’m going down a different path with this answer. Trying to take the high road, so to speak. My very own NPD is surprised by unconditional love. Since its not in his bag of tools, he can’t imagine love without ifs, ands or buts. He is genuinely surprised by unexpected kindness. I made a pact either with God or the devil, I’m not sure, to have a relationship where I love unconditionally. It is inextricably made doubly challenging in that we are in a Dom/sub relationship. My lack of shock surprises him. He is surprising himself too. He is currently undergoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and lea 

Hello Steve, I discovered something very amazing, and quite wonderful around 18 months ago. Prior to this, I had been having a cyber relationship with someone whom exhibited narcistic tendencies. This cyber relationship also consisted of cybersex, which at the time, was a new phenomenon to me. During the length of time that I took part in this relationship, around twelve months, I was subjected to tantrums, long periods of silence, plus being insulted, and expected to be on hand on my end of the computer despite a five hour time zone difference. I eventually sent a final email which exited my wi

When you figure out they are a loser. When you acknowledge Narcissists are the biggest, complete and total losers ever possible, you realize how unworthy they are to be present in your life. You realize that their word means nothing. And yes, they'll keep saying bad shit, but it's all coming from a loser. The difference is now your expectations are set accordingly. You understand they'll always be the biggest loser, and there's no reason to react to their pathetic attempts at making you feel bad. Because NOW YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO CARE ABOUT SOME LOSER WHOSE ONLY GOAL IS TO MAKE YOU A BIGGER LOSER 

Oooh, I love this question because I know the answer. I’ve lived to find out the answer firsthand. Rebecca Zung is right. The narcissist is blindsided when you finally dump his ass and go no-contact. He knew without a doubt he had you so trauma-bonded, wrapped around his finger so tight, that you weren’t going anywhere. At first he’ll think it’s a little game: “So cute!!! She is mad so she has to punish me, lol. She’s so stupid. She’ll be back with her little suitcase in the morning, probably still pouting. I’ll play her game for a little while. But I WILL put her back in her place. How dare tha 

I recently answered a question on “good habits to practice to scare narcs away”, and I think the essence of that answer is important here. This is because the things you do to scare a narcissist away are the very same things that surprise them. Things to practice to surprise a narc/ scare them away: It is good to practice the habit of avoidance and ignoring, which is helpful when dealing with toxic people. If someone is condescending to you, tries to belittle or demean you… or triangulate you, don't give any emotional response. Don't let the (subtle) emotional jabs at your psyche affect you. Even  

Being proven wrong when they “think” they’re always right. The second ex is a prime example of thinking she’s right, and proven wrong. Every time she opens that mouth, she removes all doubt. What really surprises them, is too see you’ve moved on with your life. And that you’re so much happier without them anywhere near you. When you can literally laugh at what they say. When you’re happier with someone else, and living a life they can’t be part of anymore. Jealousy is what they use in relationships too break you, and they’re the ones getting broken by it.

What does a narcissist do at the end of a relationship?
This is long, but it is the cold truth and what the end looks like. Every time. Every bond. Every “these people don't know us, that won't happen to me.” I will admit, I was that person. This isn't even the worst from what I have read, and it just happened, so only time will tell how much worse it gets. To start, there was no relationship and most of these things have been going on or at the very least, have been being carefully knit together, in advance. At the end is where the claws come out and it only becomes obvious that they are already inches deep inside of you, when you finally attempt  

In my experience what they do at the very end of a relationship kind of depends on what happened between you two towards or at the end. There are only 3 real ways a relationship with a true narcissist will end. The first is if you go all the way through the cycle, the devalue stage and then they discard you after they are totally bored with you which is most common and how most of them end! The second is if you happen to discard them at the very beginning of the devaluing stage or right before which was my case. The third is if you are able to expose them to their family, kids, flying monkeys or  

At the end of a relationship with a Narcissist, several things may happen. 1. They will discard you without a thought, and then blame the break up on you for being the problem, when we all know that it is they, who really have the issue. 2. If YOU discard the Narcissist, be prepared for things to turn very nasty extremely quickly. The number one ‘no no’ to do to a Narcissist is to wound their ego. By dumping them, you have done just that. Depending on what type of narc you’re dealing with, makes all the difference. A covert narc will try to gain support from others, trash you, and gang up on y

Then she made sure a mutual friend on FB (flying monkey) posted pics of her and new supply having a good time at what I thought was 'our’ special place. This was a few days post discard. I promptly unfriended all known monkeys at this point. They are as disgusting and insipid as the narc. Being ghosted an

When their prey has lost it’s use and value in the narcs life, they will start showing their true colors. They will continually do mental subjugation, make you feel like you are just a waste of space, unworthy, useless. They will continue to brain wash and abuse the prey which then makes them do whatever is asked of them. The Narc will continue to be so horrible and hateful and yet the prey will love her even more. Then just out of the blue, with no provocation or issues will just dump their prey in the most humiliating way possible. And yet the prey will do everything to win back the Narc and 

In my experience, and it would seem the experience of many others, a narcissist will reveal her or his true colors at the end of the relationship. With a shock, you realize you were never a person who was loved and cherished, rather you were a mere source of supply for someone incapable of any real love, except for herself. In hindsight you suspect you knew this all along, but you didn’t want to admit to it. It makes no difference how well you conducted your part of the relationship, you will be made to know it was never good enough for the narcissist. You hope things can still be worked out be

Who was the most disturbed person you ever knew personally? What did they do to earn this title from you?
My younger brother. I never had a clue about what my brother was really about until the day he came home from a destroyed marriage. Both my parents were still alive. He brought home allmost all the furniture from the marriage he had. I was working out for awhile and did not see the events that occurred but he somehow crept into the household and we must take into account that my parents were on their eighties.

My parents accepted as they “were trying” and although relatively newlywed, they were older and wanted to start a family.

He never talked, he just looked at everyone in an eerie way. He would sit in windowsills and stare outside and teachers basically let him wander around class during lessons. It was weird; they never told him anything. And strangely, although he should have been a distraction to the rest of us kids, we knew something was wrong with him so nobody ever bothered him. I tried to be friendly once, but he looked at me and looked away. One 

I worked as a stewardess onboard private yachts, this person was a captain. 2captains would work on a rotation of 2 months on/2months off, and since I joined the boat less than 2 months before, I only met one of them. The day arrived and the second captain was about to join the boat. Surprisingly all other stewardesses started to be worried as they told me he was very strict, and things like "you don't know him, you have to wait until he's in a good mood to talk to him". Second thing, they started to instruct me about his daily breakfast brought up by us to the bridge, and how many slices of eac 

I was working for a merchant processing firm…you know…processing credit card transactions. They hired this guy Mike (…not his name). Mike seemed like a nice enough person, all of us made a point to welcome him into the firm both collectively and on an individual basis. We had a lunch for mike and we’d stop by his cubicle, introduce ourselves, ask how he’s doing…that sort of thing, Two things about mike were definitely different. One, he had a very pronounced “wild” and wide eyed look all the time and the other was a mechanical brace on one arm from shoulder to wrist. When asked he said he had a 

I once met a sociopath who raped me. And sadly not only me but 4 other friends of mine and his. I was 15 back then, and I was bullied severely at school. I didn’t have many friends, I was always so self-conscious. My family is a bit little messed up, but this is not our topic today. I was this depressed teen in our neighbourhood. And then, he came into my life. The night we met we were hanging around with some friends in the neighbourhood. He and his other 2 friends approached us with guitars in their backs. They were 19–20 years old. They played guitar in the garden and we decided to join them.  

I’d have to say my ex-husband’s mother. She was my mother-in-law for 27 years and she treated me like dirt but that wasn’t why I thought (think) she is disturbed. She was extremely book smart. She knew a lot about psychology (oh, the irony) and anatomy. She was a RN and director of a huge business in the healthcare field. She was also very beautiful and she loved her children a lot. You’d think all of these positive attributes would make her a well-rounded person but she was NOT. She was bizarre and actually, quite scary. She liked to torture me mentally and she would snicker after doing it. She 

I wouldn’t say I “knew” this person but I was acquainted with him at a job I worked at years ago. I couldn’t even tell you his name because he didn’t last long, but I still remember the crazy shit he did and said. I was training said guy to be a grill cook at a family owned bar where I was the only night shift cook we had who knew what they were doing, so all the training of new members fell on me. This guy was heavily tattooed and boasted about his other grill-cook jobs and ended up calling our bar a “third world dive bar”. It was fitting to say the least. One night when teaching him how to pre 

The most disturbed person I knew personally, hmmm. I'd have to say it was my first puppy love boyfriend. He was my first. I'd had only one other high school boyfriend before him. He started out somewhat normal. We were in our teens so there was a lot of showing off and testosterone shit. He was a hyper guy in general. I loved how fun he was and he had a really big dick. It doesn't matter now but it meant something then. I'm immature now and even more so then. I met him through my best friend at the time. She was his girlfriend, they broke up, she said she was sick of him and that I could have

Do you miss the person you believed your narcissistic ex to be?
Shortly after I got married, in 1967, I realized I didn’t know the man I married. I thought “don’t worry he’ll change because that’s what we do when we get married and become responsible.” That didn’t change with him. He stayed irresponsible for at least the next 13 years. Even after having children, he stayed irresponsible. But I saw the potential in him, and he was a good provider. Somehow I managed to grow up fast after the marriage and took responsibility for more than my share. I thought he if just quits drinking he’ll be fine. Wrong! I knew nothing about narcissism and even when I learne 

The person I believed he was ? Yes , sometimes I do At times memories of our life come in fragments to my mind and they hurt so I sigh and push them back into the corners I remember the sparkle in his eyes when he looked at me . The eagerness to please and his joy in making me happy .His bending over backwards to help in any way possible. When I surprised him with the news of our first child and he was elated . I thought I saw so much good in him once The non stop little gifts and cards filled with love , making me chicken noodle soup when I was sick and tucking me in . Getting up in the middle of 

I used to do. I sure mourned for him for what felt like centuries! In fact, I think that's the biggest hurdle -- accepting that the person you loved so deeply doesn't exist, never existed, and ( hardest of all) never will. We can't love that fantasy person into existence. And even if we could, the guy walking around in his body doesn't want to become that guy. But guess what? I found something SO much better! He isn't dark and brooding. He doesn't have deep-seated childhood trauma for me to “ heal". Women do not constantly throw themselves at him, sending me into constant bouts of insecurity (ac 

Wow. I mean wow for the question. I miss the personality and traits that she projected to be before peeling off the mask and showing the true colours. Once it came to the point where I know what she was underneath, missing her as a person wasn't a thing anymore. I have had this thought for sometime now, if I missed her or the traits that she show cased? Missing a person! How do we define it? By missing their core valuesBy missing their attitude or mindsetBy missing their inner selfBy missing what they did for us or what we did for them (out of care and love; not as an object)An element that feels

Of course it is only natural to miss him. He was my world, my forever, why wouldn't I? I don't understand why he chooses to hurt me I was rhe only constant variable that he did it to or why it was so easy for him just to flip a switch and take another while keeping me in the mix, saying and doing one thing to me while destroying me to everyone else. I resented him, then I tried to show him what he done I tried reasoning, I tired every method out there but they are masters they know what button to push, how hard to push it and when. It was exhausting I dont miss that. I miss the hope I kept aliv 

At the beginning yes, I missed him like crazy. My therapist really helped me, she said of course you do, you really loved who he pretended to be, and I did. That love was real and it takes time to heal from that loss and to top it off you have to accept that he wasn’t real and then conquer the healing from the betrayal. There are many pieces to the healing journey after this type of betrayal. It makes you question humanity, it makes you question your worth, it’s awful. A promise was masterfully delivered to you by this person, a promise to love and care for you and then you have to find out th 

So I have many draft answers to other questions, but I really want to respond to this one. If I miss the person I dedicate my Q account to? So, short answer is NO. Long answer is NO, because I cannot miss someone who does not exists. Before I broke the trauma bond, I did miss him. The one he pretended to be, the one I saw during intermittent reinforcement moments. When I saw old pictures, I felt so much sadness, pity that he was so stupid for ruining things for ridiculous reasons, that it took nothing to kick me aside. It even hurt when thinking about how he said it was all one-sided (now that he d 

In some ways yes I do. My Ex was the most wonderful, loving, caring, supportive person I had ever met, when it came to me nothing was to much for her and she made me happier than I can ever remember being, I felt so loved and so very lucky that she had chosen me to spend her life with me and I would have done anything for her, and did on occasion do some really bad things for her, nothing illegal I might add but I hurt family and friends so that we could be together, I gave her every part of me and in return she gave me every part of herself, or so I thought. It wasn't long before the real her c 

Yes. However, I remind myself that he never really existed. He was an actor playing the perfect role in my own life story, based on a script he wrote using details I had shared. And, that, only in the beginning, before he mixed my persona with others he was cheating with. He performed that role over and over again with others, after observing the effectiveness of his ability to convince me that he was real. He was never real, never really existed as a whole identity. It was all merely a great performance by a well-trained actor. Part of the reason it hurts so much is because they have stolen yo 

Yes and I hate it. He was really wonderful in the beginning, and that’s what hooked me in. Even as his NPD behavior started ramping up, there would be fun times here and there. I’d spend so much time dreaming about the future he painted for us, and preparing for it, and keeping my life on hold to have it one day. I miss the spontaneous nature of our relationship and being in the company of someone who was so strong and manly. But then it all fades. There were fun times “here and there” but I start to recall how short and far apart they were, and remember I spent most of my time alone and misera

What are useful social skills that can be picked up quickly?
There are multiple social skills that can be picked up in relatively short amount of time, however, I would inspire readers to spend active efforts on this and learn from experiences as you go. In about 100 hours of efforts, you can make a significant improvements. First, I would talk about how you can work on your body language, and make a positive impact. ONE: Body fitness: This is seriously important, and with due respect to somewhat overweight people, I have to tell you that body fitness improves confidence tremendously, improves the skin glow, improves the heart rate, posture and overall lo

Here is 3 simple tips you can implement right away to improve you social skills: 1. Stop Just Smiling and Nodding - You know when you miss something the other person says because you're thinking, instead of fully paying attention. It's totally normal... everyone does it from time to time. It's actually not your wandering mind that disconnects you from a conversation. It's HOW you manage the situation WHEN your mind inevitably wanders. Maybe you smile and nod because the other person is smiling... but then you miss the next thing they say AS WELL, because you're busy wondering if they noticed that  

Eye contact. It is an idiotically simple thing, but it remains one of the most impactful life hacks around.   There are many great answers to this question, but the one that can be picked up in literally five seconds, requires no practice or special skill, and which will serve you the rest of  your life is simply a commitment to eye contact.   No matter what anyone ever tells you, the most attractive quality in a person is confidence.  But "be confident" is not very good advice.  Instead, find the best proxy for confidence, in terms of interactive behavior.  And that's eye contact.    Start this r 

Here are my 10 ideas (and #10 is my favorite): 1. Look people in the eyes. 2. Smile. 3. Ask questions. But don't kill another person with them as if inspector is investigating on them. Rather, show genuine interest for other person's life and experiences. 4. Don't talk too much. When someone tells a story, stop your urge to follow up with an example from your own life. Rather say: "Wow, that's cool!" 5. When you introduce someone, make him or her a superstar. "This is my friend Tom. I met him at my first workplace and he saved my ass when I had my first project deadline! I cannot imagine what would 

 Stare at the spaces between the eyes- most people are not comfortable maintaining eye contact and this is the perfect substitute. Just stare at the spaces between the eyes and the person will think you're maintaining eye contact.Come early- this is my number one trick. If you want instant popularity at any event, all you have to do is come early. When you come early, you get to talk with the participants as they come. You can get to know as many 10-15 people before the event starts and this will give the false impression that you know everyone.Wave at empty spaces- I learnt this from Leil Lown

Never just say ‘good when someone asks ‘how’s it going?’ - Instead of justing using a default response, have a set of little quips or pithy phrases you can use when someone asks you this common question. I usually say something like, “Any day above ground is a good one.” This seems trivial, but getting in the habit of having ‘little sayings’ instead of common responses helps you stand out from the crowd. It also teaches you to think on your feet more during other conversations and you’ll have more interesting responses to common questions like “What do you do for a living?” Developing the abil

I have a developed few of my own personal practices after a lifetime of lonely awkwardness. I have no illusions that I’m the first one to think of these. But enjoy!! I have nothing against foul language, and I use it often! But if you're in an argument, cursing a lot either means that you lack the vocabulary to truly insult somebody, or that you lack the restraint to effectively argue your point. So build your vocabulary.Like #1, most people who get into fist fights aren't smart enough to talk their way out of trouble (I learned this from Roger Ebert).Use more adjectives. If somebody asks “how 

If someone is fishing for compliments – take the bait. When someone is fishing for compliments they don’t want to hear the truth. They just want validation. It’s not about the words. It’s about making a friend feel good. This is how you do it: Friend: “I got 400 Likes on my new profile picture.”You: “That’s sick! I’ve seen it, you look amazing in it.” Another example: Friend: “I am so tired from all that working out.”You: “But it pays off. I wish I had abs like you have.” I know, you feel the urge to respond “I am sick and tired of you talking about your damn workout. Now shut the f*ck up!” But re 

 Look at the most interesting, social beings you know.  Think about what you like about them. You'll see a couple main traits YOU can emulate : Tell Crazy Good Stories The best social butterflies have a bunch of stories up their sleeve.  Humans remember experiences, meaning they remember stories.  When you get together with your buddies from high school, all you talk about is "Remember this, remember that." When you meet someone new, you want to hit on this same point. For social butterflies, you'll notice a couple things about these people as you hang out with them more. ..They usually have only a 

Stop focusing on your inner dialogue - When I was in my early twenties, I would often be worried about what I would say next…even as the person was still talking to me. This is literally THE recipe to a bad conversation. Usually after the person finished speaking, I would say what was on my mind and they would give me this look like “did you even listen to what I said?” Admit it, you’ve probably been in a conversation before and found yourself thinking of what you’re going to say next…as the other person is still talking to you. Yeah, don’t do that. You may end up missing out on what the perso

What is the single most underrated trait a person can have?
“Be the kind of person you want others to be.” ― Anurag Prakash Ray I believe the single most underrated trait a person can have is social skills. In social dynamics, there are four main personality archetypes and they're not gender-specific. To show you each, let's imagine you're in a two-piece suit attending a fancy party for work. In your hand, you're holding your favorite drink. The Supplicative (Submissive) Type The room has many of your coworkers and you see one of your direct reports. Let’s call him John. You walk up to him and start a conversation. You genuinely ask him how he is doing to build  

I could go with integrity, kindness, wisdom, mental durability, empathy, discipline or confidence…but I would say that the most underrated would have to be… Humility. In this “fake-it-till-you-make-it”, bluster and blunder, selfish and self-centered, me-first-you-never culture that has been exploding, I find humility to be extremely undervalued — and attractive. The ability to realize that you are just a cog in the wheels of the universe. To realize that you can learn something from anyone. That every person you meet is, in some way, your superior. The ability to raise others up, or to laugh at y 

Back when I was a student in university, there was a guy in my class named Sima. Sima was really funny. In my opinion, he was one of the funniest people I’ve ever met. There are some comedians who spend hours and hours every single day writing content in hopes of building up a reputation, but Sima was the kind of guy who randomly said the right thing at the right time, and the entire classroom would blow up in euphoric laughter. There wasn’t a time when you’d look at Sima, and would not see a smile on his face. He was also the kind of guy to go talk to, the quiet kid in the corner when everyone e 

 “Avoid the temptation of showing how clever you are—it is far more clever to conceal the mechanism of your cleverness.” - Robert Greene I think about this quote often. And the successful application of this quote is a major key to success. Think about it.

The ability to express and accept compliment(s). Common compliments are: “You look great.” “You write well.” “Your drawings are amazing.” What’s wrong with them, you ask? They all are extremely general and does not make the person anymore special, which against the whole point of a compliment. We compliment someone because we found something special about them, but instead of taking a little effort to think and point that specific detail out, we give a lazy general compliment. Now, compare above compliments against below and decide for yourself which sounds better: “That new hair style suits you. You

Have you ever had the perfect day? You know, that day when you are in a really good mood. You feel yourself brimming with positive energy. Motivated. Inspired. Your creative impulse is itching to be unleashed. The world is yours to conquer. So you set to work. And you are pleasantly surprised by the sheer amount of work that you are able to accomplish. It feels easy too. Almost effortless. Like floating downstream along with the current. After all, you’re in such a good mood. Your productivity is off the charts.

And second moat important triat is not caring about what herd of people say about you when they they try to discourage you. Here is a experience which i would like to share with you all.

What is the difference between an intelligent person and a wise person?
Difference between intelligence and wisdom Acquired intelligence is none other than the knowledge, skill or ability you have in a specialized area. Human intelligence is the ability to think in a rational manner, interpret things in your environment and execute actions based on your thoughts as a human being. Innate intelligence is your natural born abilities (talents). Note that sometimes it's difficult to distinguish between acquired and innate abilities. We may not know what our innate abilities are until we try our hand at different things, hobbies, occupations, sports etc. Just like acquire 

Intelligence is a knife.Wit is an ice pick.Wit requires finesse with language, a sense of humor, and probably irony. You can be very smart but rather humorless and tongue-tied.  A nuanced sense of irony also might not be a necessary strong trait for a career as a physicist. In fact being adept with a turn of a phrase is not a requirement for many careers that nevertheless require a high degree of intelligence.  But it might be for, say, the profession of political speech-writer. As with the tired-out truism that demonstrates that although all four legged animals are not dogs, a dog is indeed a 

Last year, I went on a Tinder date in London. As an attractive, well educated, and extremely modest young woman, I naturally got plenty of matches. They all tried to get me to sleep with them one way or another, but here’s a summary of what an intelligent person did and what a wise person did. They were identical in terms of positives - both were well off, well educated, and good looking. But the way they approached the date was completely different. Mr IntelligentHe wanted to make sure I know how much potential he had. He told me in which bank he worked and what bonus he got. He lied to me he  

''Wisdom is a virtue, intelligence is a trait'' The difference between being wise and being intelligent is that wisdom is so much more than intelligence. As we all know, intelligent people can become wise, if they truly want to. All they have to do is to make a few changes in their behavior and knowledge and put in some effort. So, here are the differences between wise and smart people.  Talking and Listening Wise people tend to pay more attention to what others have to say and add comments occasionally whilst intelligent people like talking in order to express their opinions, views, and ideas.

What is the difference between an intelligent person and a wise person? Wise - the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment. Intelligence - a person with the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. One of the chief reasons for studying Adam Smith is to have a working idea of “the system”. All good students of Smith know the system is more than simply government or legislative, judicial, and executive powers. It is impossible to list all the powers included in the system but a good working list of the chief powers would be the following: Government proper. Corporations as they scratc 

“Honey, I got my hair done today, look at my new fringes!” Your wife says, running her fingers through her hair looking in the mirror. Your intelligence tells you that as a matter of fact, your wife’s new hair style isn’t as good as her last one. Your wisdom will tell you to keep your mouth shut. Let’s take a look at it in a broader manner: Intelligent people tend to process information in a logical way, whereas wise people process not just the logic, but the emotional, the spiritual, and the subtle side of the logic as well. This could be crucial at times when dealing with situations faced in pr

Intelligence is solving problems, making observations, learning, and being aware of your surroundings. Wisdom is being aware of the self, knowing right from wrong, morality, avoiding mistakes, predicting the future, and being strong. Wise people are more likely to be happy. They are balanced, resourceful, and good friends. Intelligent people may be happy but they may not be. They read, relate, listen, and think but they may be evil. From the Buddhist perspective wisdom is the ideal virtue. All virtues are just a type of wisdom including intelligence. Wisdom also includes kindness, courage, and s

Hello Abhishek! Thanks for the A2A. Intelligence is an ability to function appropriately in everyday life i.e. a basic capacity to deal with situations. In everyday life, people term someone who performs well in examinations, or who has some creative ideas for business, or who has a quick solution to a problem as ‘intelligent’. This is actually an abuse of the term, for in reality, even someone who does not really stand out, but manages to deal adequately with his life is intelligent. Intelligence is largely genetic, with most people showing an average intelligence from birth, while a few showi 

Read this story.. and get to know..  Once two persons were sitting near a temple and were chit chatting… It was getting dark and cloudy… By then another person came there and asked if he could join them. They said 'oh with pleasure'.

Oh, we too are hungry they said. “He has 3 rotis and I have 5 rotis - Let all of us share” - said the second guy. Then a question arose as to how to share 8 rotis among three of them… The first person suggested “let's make three pieces out of ea 

What psychological experiment changed the world?
Why is it that intelligent people tend to feel lonely most of the time?
I think this is a great question and one I have thought about a lot. There definitely is a correlation between high levels of intelligence and solitude, sadness/depression, and difficulty connecting with other people. I think there are various factors that could explain different cases of intelligent people being lonely, but most of them boil down to the types of personalities and disposition that go along with a person of exceptional intelligence. In a lot of ways, people who are highly intelligent can live inside their own bubbles, basically needing their own insular space carved out for the 

 Intelligent people often know more than less intelligent people. They know more about their own beliefs, they dictate their own logic and have a better grasp on their life, at least most of the time. Most of the time they reason their problems away or get to a pretty accurate actionable step sooner than others. All of this makes it very difficult to do the one thing they need to do to be less lonely: Trust others. Intelligent people were often smart enough to make it through their life on their own thus far and every time they have trusted people, they were met with disappointment. The other people 

It is not the intelligent people, but usually the SELFISH,GREEDY, ARROGANT, EGOISTIC, AND STINGY PEOPLE who end up being lonely in life. If we are not willing to share our time, energy, wisdom and money with others, we might feel isolated. Poor people are rarely alone. They convert their misery into blessing and joy by sharing the same with one another. On the other hand wealthy or greedy (greedy are not always rich but they love money anyway) convert the blessing into misery by remaining aloof. A growing body of findings also suggests that “those with fewer resources attend more to the needs of  

Wow! A lot of very interesting and detailed answers here! I’ll put in some of my thoughts: Intelligence is not highly regarded in America. Being male and highly intelligent puts me at a severe disadvantage in dating and the mating game. To win as a male here you need to be rich and/or handsome. And not be too intelligent as a mate will look at this as a gulf and not an opportunity to build a bridge and/or come up to speed.Females being highly intelligent appear to me to have a very significant problem. My daughter was (still is) quite a knockout beauty but she told me that she had to dumber her

Not all intelligent people end up being lonely. In fact I would say that the majority are not lonely, as they gravitate towards other intelligent people and tend to develop relationships that are rewarding. But you have to be living and working within a place or structure that gives you exosure to these people in the first place. I do not, am not currently working in a place where there are higher level intelligent people or culturally experienced and as such am very much alone. But needs must. I am not exactly lonely, but am a little depressed. I am definitely looking forwards to next year when  

I can come up with two explanations. 1. Being very different than the average (in any trait, really) means that, unless you’re one of the lucky ones, most things around you don’t satisfy you, since they weren’t built “for you” (or people like you). This will make you change your environment due to dissatisfaction and lack of sense of belonging at a certain point, and move somewhere else. And this, in turn, will basically kill (for you) the social environment you were a part of before the change - with various degrees depending on how radical the change is, you’ll have to start a new life from s 

When you are talking about the “high end” geniuses you will find that they are extremely obssessive about one or maybe two particular subjects (and any subjects directly related to those) over all others. In many ways, because they spend so much time and mental focus on those specific things they can often be quite naive (and quite honestly “stupid”) about many others. Many of those being things that “normal” people have at least some knowledge and common sense about. Even things like normal human interactions are not much more than vaguely functional just due to lack of time and experience wit 

It is the thrice-goddamned communication range which makes finding friends difficult and a spouse neigh impossible once your IQ is high enough. Not lack of interpersonal skills nor low emotional quotient. The higher your IQ is, the more skewed your communication range is towards the right half-plane of the Gaussian curve and the more difficult it is to find meaningful human relations. Including friends. The concept of communication range was established by Leta Hollingworth and it is +/- 2 sigmas or standard deviations - roughly 30 points - to either direction. Thus the communication range of so 

There is much less literature on the correlation between IQ and Intraversion than I expected, and the results that do exist seem to be quite mixed, ranging from negative, to positive to none. Therefore, I looked at some of my own data. In a study with 820 adults from the Metropolitan Region of Recife (MRR), Pernambuco, Brazil, the relationship found between IQ and Intraversion is depicted below.  So, indeed, those with IQs in the Gifted range tend to have substantially higher levels of Intraversion than the other strata of intelligence, at least in the MRR. Looking at the other social dimension of 

Imagine going through your cumulative years trying to learn as much as possible. Thinking that it was entirely normal, while simultaneously believing that you were behind everyone else. Others seemingly effortlessly picking up on social nuances that you felt you were oblivious to. Others forging friendships that would possibly last a lifetime as you struggled to make connections that may last a day. Wondering why you felt like such an outcast in what would otherwise be considered a cakewalk in this crazy ordeal that we classify as life. Depending on how far East you fall on the bell curve, and l 

What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
What fascinates me the most is the fact that amongst all the languages in the world, it is English which has gained so much popularity among the people especially when you're living in a country like India wherein if you know how to converse in English, you are simply above everyone. Just as I read on Quora which was a lovely set of words as of how to impress an Indian which said 'If you're an Indian, speak in English. If you aren't an Indian, speak in Hindi. Congratulations. You've successfully impressed an Indian.' It doesn't really matter whether you know anything or not, till you're able t

THE AWESOME HUMAN POTENTIAL To me, there’s nothing more interesting than the prospect of endless mutual being in a state of mental and structural perfection, having unlimited power, and unlimited mobility through unlimited worlds. This is the promised inheritance of all humanity. Regardless of whether one finds it believable, there’s nothing anyone can conceive that holds more potential pleasures, excitement and abundant living for more people than this. One merely need visualize what I’m saying, and contemplate all it implies. But let me help. Because, from experience, I know people have difficu 

“Simplicity of being in the moment" It never fails to impress or attract Me. In the competitive world where almost every second person have infinite wants, goals to achieve as everyone strives harder and harder to have what society has labelled as “perfect future" and not what is there definition of “perfection” which make them satisfied and make them feel relaxed enjoying the present.Complexity has taken over peoples life.There is no end to desire as its well said by realized masters that “A desire fullfilled breeds more desire".

Masdar CityMasdar is the world’s first zero-carbon, zero-waste city. The city is powered by only renewable energy and has walls - yes, walls! - to keep the high hot desert winds away from the city’s inhabitants. Situated in the UAE, the whole city is raised a few feet above the ground to keep it cooler, with the spaces between buildings narrower to always keep people in the shade. The city has 130 feet tall wind towers that suck air from above and convert it to a cool breeze which blows on the street. Any car that enters the city is parked on the outskirts. The reason?

How the Python that kills and swallows is at peace with the people of Nembe kingdom. When you visit communities under the kingdom, you would see this reptile crawling about, sometimes it would even enter homes and around the people without hurting one another. The people of Nembe in Nigeria consider Ogidiga, the Python as their national god. This self-made god of latter ages was simply to imitate the other coastal towns which were having something visible as their national gods: The Bonny People had the Iguana as their national god.

LIfe is full of ups and downs, depression and excitement, lessons and love. I find life very interesting indeed. The Natural Universe It is amazing the way the universe has built everything in the right place Arby's the right time. The Earth was slowly manufactured over (potentially) tens of millions of years, begging as hydrogen gas, compressed so hard and so hot the gas squashed and baked so much in the core of a star that it began to connect to other molecules thus creating harder, solid materials and gasses. After millions of years the star ran out of helium and a huge (and I mean damn huge)  

 I want to travel. I want to travel the whole damn world. Seriously, I used to dream about Lamborghini and Porsche when I was in class 12th. Gradually, I realized that my love for travelling has outgrown everything. Every need in my life now revolves around the idea to travel. I know life is too short and we all dream about something and my dream is to travel.  Amidst this, if I end up having a small flat instead of a big mansion, a hatchback instead of a sedan and noodles to eat instead of a lavish three course meal, I’d be okay.  You are likely to learn more when you travel, if that's your pur 

This is Kim Kardashian when she was 13.  Now wait, this isn’t what you think it’s about. Yes she looks different and still beautiful and didn’t need surgery and such, whatever. That isn’t news . A while ago, I posted a photo and some people were DMing me and freaking their shits out from it. I’m no goddess, so I was confused what the big deal was about the whole thing. Apparently I looked somewhat similar to that photo of Kim Kardashian when she was 13.  (Yes I was wearing a BBB shirt. Zos got nicer merch than his free throw, okay?) Now before you guys bash me for thinking I look like her, obviously th 

THE FERMI PARADOX Everyone feels something when they're in a really good starry place on a really good starry night and they look up and see this:    Some people stick with the traditional, feeling struck by the epic beauty or blown away by the insane scale of the universe. Personally, I go for the old “existential meltdown followed by acting weird for the next half hour.” But everyone feels something. Physicist Enrico Fermi felt something too—”Where is everybody?”  A really starry sky seems vast—but all we’re looking at is our very local neighborhood. On the very best nights, we can see up to 

Do short people feel uncomfortable around tall people?
Yes, it’s just awkward having to look up to people all the time, and then there are other bizarre incidents that spawn from being short. I never knew I was short until I was about 16. That’s because prior to that, I hadn’t been short. I stopped growing around age 11 and became short. Once, when I was at school, some girls were talking about how they felt about their height. I opened my mouth and was about to say I was satisfied with my height, when they all spoke in unison. “Don’t worry, you’ll grow. You still have time.” I shut my mouth, confused. I’d had no idea I was short up until that momen 

NOT AT ALL! In fact, I wish I was shorter than I am as I am going through a body phase at the moment. I suppose you can say “quarter-life crisis” as I have been isolated and unloved due to society and being a Gay Guy that's on the feminine side. Usually, I would stand at 5′6 since my mom is slightly shorter than 5′4 due to her reaching middle age so I would consider myself 5′5 as we look just about the same height. What I find it interesting is some of the guys where I'm from (Phoenix AZ), are a couple inches shorter than me like they are between 5′2-5′3 and sorta feel a little uneasy as I envy t 

I'm 5'2″. Being on the teetering edge of being called short, I guess I can answer this question.  Hell no! I don't feel uncomfortable around tall people. (Trust me, majority of my cousins and friends average at 6ft.)  I have to agree that it's a huge inconvenience when tall guys ( constituting 70%) sit in front of me in classes. I have to crane my neck around them, twist my body this way and that to see the screen and my professor. I guess I might appear to be doing the nagini dance to the ones behind me. And don't even get me started on the lower half of the screen. Hours of yoga especially to to 

I’m five one, and I do often feel uncomfortable around tall people. It depends on the situation. Most of the time I don’t notice that I am smaller than other people. SO many times in my life I’ve gotten pictures back and realize, whoa, I’m like this miniature stranger in the middle of all of these perfect looking people :/ I don’t necessarily realize I’m so much shorter than others until I see photographic evidence.But, times I feel awkward:When I am the only short person I sometimes feel like a child around adults. When I am a lot shorter than someone and we are standing I feel like talking 

Obviously I can’t speak for all short people, but I certainly do, at times. More so women than men. Like, every single guy in my hometown is taller than 180 cm, my height, so I mostly don’t even notice that anymore. I ONLY notice when an adult male is actually shorter than me! Not my height, but a good three inches/7.5 cm shorter than me. Then I go, “Hey neat! It’s another me! Low five!” But usually, it’s the tall women that make me uncomfortable. Not for anything they’re doing, but because I utterly loathe and despise my own height, because of the aforementioned shortness aspect of it. While a 

I will be speaking from my perspective and perspectives along with experiences differ from person to person, so it will not be a general answer. Sometimes, yes, it can get a little uncomfortable. I will come to that in a few. However, most of the time, it's quite okay being short. As a 4′10″ person (who used to vehemently believe she was a solid 5′ until it was rechecked), I would say that being short has both advantages and disadvantages and I've come to happily live with that fact. It can get uncomfortable in crowds, where most people are taller than you. It's in human nature to ignore that whi 

Do you know this girl -  Yes !!! She is jyoti Amge, 24yr old Indian woman, height 2 feet 7 inches!!!!!!!!! She was born on 16 december 1993 in Nagpur, maharashtra, India. And yes she is world's shortest woman. Holding Guinness book of world record.Her wax statue is also present in Celebrity Wax Museum, Lonavala.   She was a regular school going with plenty number of friends.  Following Amge's 18th birthday on 21 December 2011, she was officially declared the world's smallest woman by Guinness World Records with a height of 62.8 centimetres (2 ft 0.6 in). Her restricted height is due to a growth abnormal 

Let’s see, I’m 5′4″ and that’s simply the way it is, I don’t feel uncomfortable around people taller than me, it’d be a lot of discomfort if I did. I generally don’t think about it. Now, on the flip side, pretty much every woman I’ve hung with who isn’t related, has been taller than I, some much taller. One funny experience was when on a trip, I wound up with my buddy’s sister in law, wandering through a city in Canada, and there I was, fat, balding middle aged guy, dressing and looking my budget, walking with flowing haired green eyed 5′10″ 18 year old with flowing red hair, a bay watch body,  

 I’m a 5’4” male and my wife is a 6’1” female. We’ve been married over 10 years, have a 9 year old daughter and we’re all very happy. I’m originally from the UK and she’s an American, not sure if this makes a difference? We used to notice the giggles in restaurants etc, especially when she wore high heels (which I love her to wear!) But I think we’re used to it now and don’t notice. I obviously don’t feel uncomfortable around tall people and probably 90% of the US population are taller than I am! I firmly believed that when my wife and I had a child that he or she would be of average height, you kn 

 Previous studies have identified a genetic correllation between height and IQ using twins and family members, but this study was the first to test the connection using DNA markers in unrelated people, study author Riccardo Marioni told Britain's Sunday Times. Researchers analyzed genetic data on 6,815 men and women collected by the Scottish Family Health Study between 2006 and 2011. "We tested whether DNA-based genetic similarities among people related to their similarities in height and intelligence," Marioni said. "What we found was a small association between height and intelligence such that 

What was the final straw that caused Queen Elizabeth II to take away the patronages and titles from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle?
I’d hardly call it a final straw! They’ve had discussions for over a year. No one put pressure on Meghan to leave the royal family and relocate back to the US. She knew from the outset that they’d lose certain royal privileges. The year to transition was purely to give Harry time to choose and not to feel rushed or pressured. It was a hugely kind and considerate thing that the queen did. They chose to remain self-centred and commercial rather than royal servants of the commonwealth. Their own free choice. I’ve no idea if Harry has had is judgment clouded by the bulldozer or if he genuinely dislik 

First, please understand we are talking about the Honorary and Ceremonial Military Titles that Prince Phillip held during his “lifetime of public service” and upon his Retirement “ returned” them to the Crown to confer upon a Royal deserving and willing to continue the WORK and DUTIES that go along with the honor of wearing that military uniform. Prince Harry was given those titles and Prince Harry appeared to be proud to have them and represent The Queens Military. Until his flight to finding his freedom with flight attendant Meghan. Patronage’s were also given, to work and help fund raise and 

Her Majesty, the Queen has had some build-up before she took away Harry and Meghan’s titles and patronages. Apparently, they are not allowed to use ‘Duke and Duchess of Sussex’ in their daily lives anymore but will remain the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. I’m not too sure if I haven’t got that mixed up. In about a month, it will have been one year since Meghan and Harry left the royal family, and that was supposed to be their review period. The plan was that when the one-year ‘trial’ ended, the Royals along with Meghan and Harry would look back and decide if they wanted to return to royal life o 

Posted the following as a comment on another answer. Pretty sure it will not stand for long before being deleted. I am posting it here as an answer because it really is something that needs saying. “Opinions are one thing. Stating untrue facts is another. The Queen has not “stripped” their titles. The patronage’s and honorary military positions that Harry and Meghan held actually belong to the Queen and are extended to members of the Royal Family at her “pleasure”. As Harry and Meghan appear to have decided to reside in the US full time, the Queen has retrieved those honors from them on the sur 

While I can not pretend to speak for any member of the Royal family, I do think it is worthwhile to consider the other, more personal issues with which the Queen is dealing. Prince Phillip will, in all probability, die in the near future. If he were my husband and life-long companion I would do all I could to help him attain peace before he passed. He has been the head of their immediate family, and I imagine she might be considering his wishes, especially about any of his former and much-beloved patronages. Shame on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex that they could not find it in their hearts to 

Discretion has always been essential for the Royal Family. It goes alongside their mantra of 'Never complain, never explain'. They do not do press exposé s, and working royals are not allowed to earn money whilst undertaking royal duties for the Queen. Meghan and Harry were due to have their one year review this month of their decision to step back from the Royal Family. I think when their interview with Oprah was announced, it was clear to the Queen that they had no intention of returning to the Royal fold. She therefore took immediate action to terminate their patronages, which were not thei 

UK 09/03/21 What is not appreciated is that most of those patronages are paid for in the formm of very generous ‘expenses’ both by the UK Government and by private and charitable organisations [ DIANA went is n with nothing and went out with £20 million after taxes and not a lot went to charity either !. Diana did very little for nothing that’s for sure Notbthat I do not think that she should NOT get paid expenses but it does somehow taint the Angels Halo does it not?? ‘ If I’d been in the Queen’s position, who after all awards those patronages or permits them, as suitable for ‘Arry. . I’d have 

You question is full of false premises, so it’s impossible to give it a direct answer. But I’ll try anyway. Her Majesty the Queen has not taken any patronages away from Prince Harry. He and Meghan have voluntarily withdrawn as patrons to the various organizations they worked with or on behalf of after stepping down as senior members of the royal family.  Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex Prince Harry continues to hold all his titles, along with the style of Royal Highness. He and Meghan have voluntarily stopped using their HRH status in regard to the work they do as private citizens 

When I was in the Royal Navy there was an offence against the discipline code called “an accumulation of minor offences” This is what has happened here I think. Not one thing tipped the balance. Meghan Markle has behaved disrespectfully to our Queen in a petulant and childish way. Stamping her little feet and running off with Harry as her lapdog. The Queen said unequivocally that they cannot be half in half out. It is really that simple. Interestingly we now learn that the Oprah Winfrey had already taken place before. I wait to hear what was said but it will be revealing I’m sure in the light  

HM the Queen did NOT remove any titles from the couple. She did have them step down from the Royal Patronages, she had assigned them. As they have permanently stepped down from being working-royals that is consistent with how she has handled royal patronages for decades. She did remove Prince Harry from Honorary Military Appointments like Captain-General of the Royal Marines. He retains is military rank earned while serving. Those are earned and awarded by the Armed Forces. And in her statement she clearly said the couple “remain much beloved members of the royal family.” 474 views · View upvotes3Chris Ashbrook, novelist and ghostwriter (2001-present)Answered February 24, 2021 · Author has 2.4K answers and 491.2K answer views

What is the single most underrated trait a person can have?
“Be the kind of person you want others to be.” ― Anurag Prakash Ray I believe the single most underrated trait a person can have is social skills. In social dynamics, there are four main personality archetypes and they're not gender-specific. To show you each, let's imagine you're in a two-piece suit attending a fancy party for work. In your hand, you're holding your favorite drink. The Supplicative (Submissive) Type The room has many of your coworkers and you see one of your direct reports. Let’s call him John. You walk up to him and start a conversation. You genuinely ask him how he is doing to build  

I could go with integrity, kindness, wisdom, mental durability, empathy, discipline or confidence…but I would say that the most underrated would have to be… Humility. In this “fake-it-till-you-make-it”, bluster and blunder, selfish and self-centered, me-first-you-never culture that has been exploding, I find humility to be extremely undervalued — and attractive. The ability to realize that you are just a cog in the wheels of the universe. To realize that you can learn something from anyone. That every person you meet is, in some way, your superior. The ability to raise others up, or to laugh at y 

Back when I was a student in university, there was a guy in my class named Sima. Sima was really funny. In my opinion, he was one of the funniest people I’ve ever met. There are some comedians who spend hours and hours every single day writing content in hopes of building up a reputation, but Sima was the kind of guy who randomly said the right thing at the right time, and the entire classroom would blow up in euphoric laughter. There wasn’t a time when you’d look at Sima, and would not see a smile on his face. He was also the kind of guy to go talk to, the quiet kid in the corner when everyone e

The ability to express and accept compliment(s). Common compliments are: “You look great.” “You write well.” “Your drawings are amazing.” What’s wrong with them, you ask? They all are extremely general and does not make the person anymore special, which against the whole point of a compliment. We compliment someone because we found something special about them, but instead of taking a little effort to think and point that specific detail out, we give a lazy general compliment. Now, compare above compliments against below and decide for yourself which sounds better: “That new hair style suits you. You

What are the most extreme examples of hypocrisy?
Oh i know this one. The most extreme is definitely Singapore’s claim to be “the most environmentally progressive country in the region” This is Singapore, a pretty postcard picture that the Singaporean government wants to promote.

The most extreme hypocrisy is happening right now. China has committed unspeakable atrocities against the large Muslim Uighur population by placing them into concentration camps.

Media hypocrisy on weight loss  This is comedienne and actress Rebel Wilson who has starred in numerous Hollywood films such as Ghost Rider, Bridesmaids, Ice Age 4, all the Pitch Perfect films, Night At the Museum 3 and Jojo Rabbit.

A Dangerous Sanctuary (?)  The UK, for quite some time has been a sanctuary to a large number of Russians that have fled the Putin regime. Recently, a Russian double-agent and his daughter were found dead in a small town of southern England. This caused a huge uproar in the UK. Ms. May promptly issued an ultimatum to the Russians asking for a quick explanation and saying he (the agent) was targeted by a “military-grade nerve agent developed by Russia”.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: The World’s Greatest Hypocrite  Two years ago, Saudi Arabia called for the international community to “fight against intolerance and human rights violations”. While in Saudi Arabia, an ultra-conservative form of Islam is the law, only mosques are allowed, women have next-to-none rights, flogging is a punishment, homosexuals are tortured and killed, and executions are in public. Their campaign in Yemen has led to war crimes and crimes against humanity. And yet, they have the guts to tell others to “stop discriminating based on religion, culture, etc.” Saudi students are t 

Why does my daughter's friend get free lunch at school even though she brings a different snack to school every day and her mom drives a brand new car?
My kids get free lunches because we get food stamps. My son (high school) always eats at school. My daughter (elementary school), is a picky eater and takes her lunch half the time. I just bought a brand new 2019 Kia two weeks ago. So new, that I haven’t even received the paperwork from the bank yet. Judging by your question, you are going to judge us based on that little bit of information that I provided What you don’t know is how we came to this situation. The food stamps, we received $20 per month. That’s it. Because of that tiny bit, I don’t have to stress about whether my kids are eating wh 

Because becoming poor doesn't mean you automatically lose everything you've ever had. I lived on the streets for 6 years and I had an iPad the whole time, as selling it might have fed me for a few days, but owning it kept me sane in a very physically and mentally difficult situation (I was able to make music on it, which is emotionally helpful, could keep in touch with friends and family which helps keep you stable, and I could watch things and listen to music to help myself “escape” for a while). A lot of people judged me for living on the streets with that, or thought it meant I couldn't rea 

Obviously I don't know the circumstances of your daughter's friend but there could be numerous explanations. Maybe sometime you could ask her parents if it could be polite. My sons get free lunches with our food stamps. I like how food stamps cover all kinds of foods now and I can choose organic. I've always been focused on organic/natural for my adult years and I know how to shop carefully and most days I provide my sons with healthy lunches to bring to school. But they can also get free lunches on the days something is available for them. They are vegetarians so a lot of the meals aren't rea 

That’s an extremely judgmental question. In short, first, you do not know the circumstances of the person. Second, you do not have to be homeless and starving to receive school lunches or WIC or a lot of state and federal benefits. I grew up with divorced parents. My father made great money as union negotiator and he paid his child support…and that was mostly it, other than an occasional gift (and occasional visit). My mother mostly stayed home to take care of us, only working part time around our school schedules when we were young. We qualified for some of those benefits. Often we just didn’t 

Clearly, her mom is smart. I'm just kidding but serious at the same time. Out of curiosity, what sparked the question? I ask this because the only person who can answer is the mom and unless she has a quora you will only receive suggested interpretations, not an exact answer. Being it so personal I would ask the lady myself, in a personable manner of course though I feel I know her response already. Lastly, you cannot judge a book by its cover, I will add personal info here for this one, my son qualifies for free lunch at school being that I myself at a point in time received assistance. That  

as a university student，I also get the same question to you sometimes. One of my classmates applied student subsidies every year. This found is supposed to help those students financially in need finish their college. But she has a lot of clothes of expensive brand，like ugg and is equipped with Apple computer.（I don’t know whether the prices of Apple or UGG things are expensive or not for a student，but in China they are，especially for a student！）And She go travelling frequently. Even in a two-day weekend before finnal tests when students usually close themselves into libraries and review what  

The most likely answer is that you live in a community that under federal or state rules qualifies for free lunches for everyone in the school district who applies for them. Many communities meet the guidelines for every student to get a free lunch, free breakfast, free weekend backpack and free summer lunch/dinner program. In the age of COVID, that means they would also qualify for an automatic food stamps/SNAP food replacement subsidy or free food deliveries to their homes. But it could also mean that they bought or leased that nice car, or get to drive one as part of an employee perk for wor 

First I’m wondering how you know she gets free lunch? Where I live, every single student has to type in their student Id number (even my kindergartener) to buy lunch. Parents put money on the kids account or they get free lunch. But no one will know if it’s free, not even the teachers. As for the snack, free breakfast and lunch doesn’t include the snack during class. If the parent doesn’t send a snack, they wouldn’t have a snack to eat while everyone else in the class eats. I don’t really know what you mean by “different” and “expensive” but I coupon so I get tons of snacks for free. Brand name 

How does having a different snack every day make someone not eligible for free lunches??? Someone please explain this to me because I really don’t know. Are poor people supposed to have the same snack every day??? Are they not supposed to have snacks at all? I mean, the brains of children really don’t really function well when the kid is hungry. Are poor people supposed to be hungry as a penance for being poor? You would think that people would be happy that they parent cares enough to make sure, and can afford snacks for the kid. As for the car, you really just don’t know. Sometimes it is les 

First I would ask, are you completely sure it’s a brand new, 2019 car? Can you be sure it’s not a very well kept 2017 car? A two year old car would be cost effective, dependable, and still look really new. People need cars to get to work. You can be low income and still have a car. Are you sure the car wasn’t given to her, or sold cheaply to her by a friend or family member? My son gets free lunch yet brings his lunch every day. He has some food issues and the list of foods he will eat is tiny compared to the foods he won’t eat. There are 3 foods served monthly in the cafeteria that he’s actual 

What is it like to discover that a friend is secretly wealthy?
I felt regretful after embarrassing her! She was a new student in our school. She came in-between the first term which was quite unusual at least in the school I studied at. I was feeling like the end of the world because my best friend decided to share bench with my second best friend. And we were a trio. So I was feeling left out. It's pretty sad to sit alone on a bench in front row even for a day when you are an almost 11 year old girl… Teacher introduced her in first period of class and she was granted the seat next to me. I was happy. At least she's a human being. I don't need to put bag on  

Weird. That’s the only way I can describe it. I had met a friend of my girlfriend, when I was about 19 or so. Beautiful girl - like stunningly so. Nothing about her screamed “Money”. We hit it off as friends. We talked about all kinds of things, she spent a fair amount of time in my quite humble home. One day she calls me and says “Hey, are you free for lunch today? My dad asked me to take a friend to our gym for lunch.” I agreed, though I found it strange that A) her dad asked her to go to a gym, and B) for lunch - what kind of a gym serves lunch? She comes over to my apartment, we hop into a ca 

I went to a very small religious and private school in my high school years. However the cost was deemed the cheapest in the state so the range of people who attended were from a lower to upper middle class family whose parents fought tooth and nail to pay their child’s way for a “better” chance at university and more personalised teachings. Interestingly enough, I’d never met an insanely wealthy person before and didn’t assume I’d ever meet one. I thought rich people only comprised of A-listers or world leaders and creators. I didn’t think they could be normal people. There had been a girl in my 

When I was in the USAF military back in the late sixties/early 70’s, I was reassigned to a base in Oklahoma. Even though I was an SP (now known as Security Forces), we had a group of guys in a weather squadron who I got to know. One of the men was a nice looking airman from some place in Illinois and was pleasant and a very down to earth kind of guy. He even had an apartment off base which we could go to. And he drove a modest Chevy vehicle. I wondered how he could afford this. Eventually, after he got to know me, he explained who he really was. An heir to a family who was involved in weapons  

Let’s call my friend Sam and another friend called Josh. One afternoon, Sam and I agreed to meet up at Josh’s house to prepare for an upcoming speech. Halfway through the speech, we were hungry. Josh brought out several pack of instant noodles from the cupboard and handed over to Sam. Sam opened the packet, only to realised a small part of the noodle was crushed. He stared at it furiously and exclaimed, “WTF man, ewww, the noodles are crushed, let’s throw it in the bin.”. Josh and I look at it in disbelief, “No. Are you an idiot?. It’s still food. It’s edible.”  After we finished eating, Sam got up a 

Odd. Awkward and of course, very situation reliant (in my case, embarrassing). So I met this girl in New Zealand. She was Indian and on a trip to Queenstown with her family. Pretty, simple girl who you could enjoy an intelligent conversation with. We hit it off instantly and kept in touch till long after she left NZ. Fast forward a few months and I meet her in Mumbai. I was at a low point in my life and career, making barely anything. She invited me to Irish House in the city/Lower parel. I catch a Mumbai local, same old routine of jostling and hurtling about for standing space, clueless about th 

It didn’t change much between our friendship, except that I can’t participate in all the activities that they can but they understand that I was and still am friends with a girl who came from a wealthy family. When I first met her in university/college she just blended in with everyone else. She did things that everyone else would do: we went out for parties, go out for dinners, hung out at a mall and studied together. This went on far a year and we started establishing a good friendship. In the next year she was planning an extravagant party and was asking who wanted to come and that we will sp 

It was an odd feeling to have my view of someone changed in an instant - a true paradigm shift. This person wasn't a close friend, but rather the girlfriend of one of my fraternity brothers. At the time, the mid 1980s, I was going to a college on one of the more remote campuses outside of a very working class city. The girl involved with my frat brother was nice, fairly intelligent, pretty but not stunning, and didn't really stand out from the other girls we associated with. Until, that is, one day when she mentioned that her parents were away for the weekend and we could have our weekly party  

I have had this happen to me about 100 times. I lived in Bethesda, Maryland or nearby for almost a decade. This area has a large Jewish population. I know so, so many Jewish people that live very simply, but are very wealthy. I have a Jewish “Godmother” whose husband once owned 100 houses! But looking at how she lives one would never guess. And discovering the net worth of any of these people never changed my relationship with any of them, even though I am not in their league, not by a mile! Coming from a tech background, I also have a lot of friends in Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley technoprene 

I know some wealthy people but I wouldn't say they're secretly wealthy. But that doesn't mean I know they're wealthy, either. More like, they just act like normal people and don't consider their level of wealth in their day-to-day interactions. I don't consider it a priority to find out the wealth of everyone I know. Their wealth might not be a secret, but that doesn't mean I haven't been surprised by it from time to time. About this same time last year, I was invited to the house of some people from church. I had known them for years but only really caught up with them at church. This was my fi

How did you lose your best friend?
We ended up having sex. (Obvious mature content ahead) Let me give a little bit of a backstory. I was probably 16 at the time, I'm a girl. I had just moved to this new city 5 months ago and ended up becoming really good friends with this girl in my class. Lets call her Z. She was super nice to me and we ended up becoming very close. We would watch movies and hang out all the time and sometimes even sleepover, but nothing ever happend at those sleepovers. We would talk about life and our hopes and the latest gossip in our school or whatever typical 16 year old girls talk about. We never really talk 

I'm a man and my best friend was a woman. It was a strange situation because I had feelings for her that I tried to hide to myself for not losing her. Well, as you can imagine, it ended quite badly. Everything happened about 10 years ago. It'll be quite long to read, I've never told this story in very details to anyone. Sorry if my English is not perfect, I'm not a native speaker. So, that’s the story I was very young, about 12 or 13 years old, when we talked for the first time. At that time, the first mobile phones became popular (you probably remember the old Nokia 3310/3330) and everyone had one

I was responsible for her weight gain. She was fat because of me.

This story has some graphic details that are hard to take. Drugs and life just evaporated who he was. Not a day goes by where I don’t wonder if I could have done more to save him.

We almost kissed and got into a relationship. I haven't asked her permission to post this story so she will be unnamed. Let's call her S. We have been best friends since the past 14 years. I met S back in my 3rd standard when I used to live in Mumbai. She lived in my adjacent society but the kids of both the societies used to play together. We had a whole group then, but we were closest to each other. The moment we met, we found out that we have much more things in common. We went to the same school and even shared the same birthday!

I used to look after my best friend’s dogs at her and her partner’s house for a month every year while they went on holiday abroad. I did this for 10 years. They were incredibly good to me also, giving me a place to live for years when I was financially at rock-bottom. I looked on them as my family. Then 2 years ago I moved in with my partner. We looked for a place to live where my friends’ dogs could come and stay with us every year for a month. But for a while we were living in a flat - no dogs allowed. A few months before going on holiday, my friends asked me to look after their dogs as norma 

So, here is the story, I had a bunch of girlfriends some time ago.. We were close sisterhood since Junior High School (approx. when we were 13–14 years old) until I cut the rope back in end of 2014 (when I was 30). My old bff consisted of 5 girls incl. me, who are all married with kids. I don’t mean to brag but I used to believe my gang was super, they are smart and good at work (dermatologist, lawyer, manager), successful rich husbands, cute kids, and so.

Elena also tried to break me and my other best friend (Ella Lockeby, we are still best friends to this day) up by spreading lies. Overall it was just a very toxic environment.

What would you do if your best friend stole your husband?
My answer may sound brutal but I am not apologizing if you are hurt by my rant because it needs to be said and you need to hear it. I would do absolutely nothing whether it was my best friend or a family member. Well, I would probably never speak to him or her again except during the divorce proceedings which I would instigate. No one can STEAL your husband. He isn't a damned toaster that she stuck under her coat and ran out the door with. If your husband is sleeping with another woman, if he left you for another woman, if he married another woman, it isn't because she stole him from you! It is b 

What would I do? I would marry her husband …..and I did just that. We have now been married for almost 41 years. Back on January 1, 1979, my friend and my then husband approached me and told me that she was leaving her husband and he (my then husband) was leaving me for her. My husband told me he didn't love me anymore….after 4.5 years of marriage, having a six month old son and buying our first house. I was upset and hurt. Her husband, who had just been discharged from the Navy and had a four year old daughter and two year old son with her…. was also hurt.. Being just out of the Navy, he was n 

Im not married but i still wanted to answer this question.. Id be mad and i aint even gonna lie i would probably do something to F with her life like she did mine.

But her being my best friend, one who i share all the dirty intimate stories that happen between me and my husband with . Shes the one i talk to about the problems in our marriage. Shes supposed to be the one i can count on to have my back if she ever saw another woman flirting with my husband or saw him out with another woman. Shes supposed t 

I’m still a teenager so I’m not thinking about marriage. With that being said, I’ll answer the question as : What would you do if your best friend stole your boyfriend? Well for starters, that would depend if I dated him while I knew she liked him orIf she never liked him and wanted to do it because she stopped liking me.For Reason 1, I would be mad but not steam coming outing my ears mad. Here’s why. If she is my best friend, she would’ve known that I liked him and I would’ve known that she liked him. Now, if the guy and I started dating she would be the first person to know. In addition, she w 

What do you mean “to steal” your husband? that means you were married to that person, probably with kids, then your husband Divorce you to go and marry your best friend? is that what you mean? or you mean, while still married your husband was sleeping with your best friend? Although the bigger fight is with my husband not with her, because he is the one i vowed to be with, to love and to share every bit of me with till eternity, so why should you do that?! Anyway, for the type of person i am, my friend will not do either of that to me. Not because she’s not thinking of it, but we have had disc 

I’m not married or attracted to men, but this question is hypothetical anyways. If my best friend, or anyone, stole my spouse from me, I’d call the cops and have them arrested. Operator: 9–1–1, what’s your emergency? Me: There’s been a theft! Operator: Okay sir, I’ll send a police officer to your address. Can you tell me what was stolen? Me: My husband. Operator: Your… your husband? Me: Yes. Operator: I’m sorry, but I don’t understand. Me: Well, the hypothetical question specifies I have a husband. It’s the 21st century already, you shouldn’t find it that difficult to understand. Operator: No I understo 

Interesting question: Firstly, folks, be wary of whom you call “friend” and whom you let in your house. Old folk in ‘Bama used to say “don't keep a revolving door”. It's true. Once in a blue moon, my husband and I have a friend over, but in general, we're quiet folk. We feel our home is a sanctuary from the varying energies of folk. And we like it that way. But back to this hypothetical question: I wouldn't have to do anything because karma would bite her AND him. It may sound strange, but all my life, those who sought to do evil or did do bad things towards me, I would later found out were douse 

This happened to my next door neighbor. We both moved into this neighborhood within a couple of months of each other. She went home for lunch one day and found her husband in bed with her bestfriend. At the time, their son was about 12 years old. The kid seemed like a nice kid but you can tell that something is different about him. The neighborhood parents would not allow their children to play with him without adult supervision. They also did not allow their kids to go to his house and it didn’t matter even if his parents were home. They seemed like a nice couple, so in love, constantly holdin 

Hello. If my best friend stole my husband it would break my heart and make me cry and then I’ll be really angry for a while. But I wouldn’t stay angry. She deserves finally have a good guy in her life and if she makes my husband truly happy then I would want him to be happy like I would want her to be. It may sound odd but we’re talking what if’s. I love them both but I won’t stay friends with an ex (it’s something I already do)and I wouldn’t want to stay with a friend who goes after her best friends husband. I would cut them both out of my life and wish the best. I’m a strong independent woman a 

well the way i see it, lets forget about your best friend for a second, your best friend is not married to you, you are not sharing your life with your best friend, you are not growing old and having kids with your best friend. you married your husband, your husband married you. made promises. to be loyal and faithful. he betrayed you, so this is all on him, 100 percent, non of this is on your best friend. because your best friend did not swear any oaths or was never committed to you at all. they were just there the longest. and as for your best friend, obviously not off the hook . because for

This story has some graphic details that are hard to take. Drugs and life just evaporated who he was. Not a day goes by where I don’t wonder if I could have done more to save him.

It started off slowly, partying in the 80’s. Pot and coke were pretty much everywhere at the time particularly because so many of my friends were making really good money.

We had a whole group then, but we were closest to each other. The moment we met, we found out that we have much more things in common. We went to the same school and even shared the same birthday!

I used to look after my best friend’s dogs at her and her partner’s house for a month every year while they went on holiday abroad. I did this for 10 years.

We looked for a place to live where my friends’ dogs could come and stay with us every year for a month. But for a while we were living in a flat - no dogs allowed. A few months before going on holiday, my friends asked me to look after their dogs as norma 

So, here is the story, I had a bunch of girlfriends some time ago.. We were close sisterhood since Junior High School (approx. when we were 13–14 years old) until I cut the rope back in end of 2014 (when I was 30). My old bff consisted of 5 girls incl. me, who are all married with kids. I don’t mean to brag but I used to believe my gang was super, they are smart and good at work (dermatologist, lawyer, manager), successful rich husbands, cute kids, and so. We were like family friends, we mostly meet with our husbands and kids altogether. I firstly thought that these girls are my everything beca 

I used to have a very toxic friendship with a girl named Elena*. At times she would be very sweet and delightful, but in a split second, she would change on you. She would constantly tell me that she had the "looks" and I had the "smarts" (a very untrue statement). Elena also tried to break me and my other best friend (Ella Lockeby, we are still best friends to this day) up by spreading lies. Overall it was just a very toxic environment. One cold morning in December, Elena made this "list" of tasks we had to complete before the end of the school year. Tasks including spreading rumors about our

As a police officer, did you completely cut off your not-so-law-abiding friends or family when you became a cop?
I remember a day, maybe six months into being a police officer, that we were all sitting around at shift change discussing our plans for the weekend. Most of the senior, married guys were just doing family stuff with a couple of guys from this or another shift coming over on Sunday to watch a game. I said was going camping with some friends. One of the cops asked, “You still have friends that aren’t cops? That’ll change soon enough.” At the time I thought, “Why would I dump my friends?” Then it started. One friend got a ticket and asked me to help fix it. Then another’s brother. And yet another 

An interesting question - brought up some things I had not thought of in many years. I entered the academy after serving in the military, so I did not at that time have any non-law enforcement friends in that area, so all my friends that I socialized with were cops or immediate family. Several years later, I did have a relative that became addicted to cocaine (at the same time I was working undercover arresting people that sold drugs) so that presented a challenge. I went to NarcAnon meetings with his wife and we tried to get him help, but he did not admit he had an issue until he was arrested  

I’m a security officer, not a police officer. This question reminds me of two characters from The Order Of The Stick.[1]  Roy is a lawful good fighter.

The thing is, they’re also in the same party. Together. Adventuring. Living together and fighting bad guys. How? Well, Belkar WANTS to keep living and being as free as he can, killing as many things as he can. He realizes that the best way for him to do that… is to be 

To a degree… but… I could just be very lucky, but my “core group” of friends have been nothing but great. One of them… the one I consider to be a brother… is a speed demon. He's been ticketed for speeding like 6 times… he never asks for favors. Only advice. He's a great, hard working… lead foot… guy. It happens. I've lost plenty of friends. Either because of time, distance or my career. But I can say I have about 10 “non cop” friends I talk, see and hangout with regularly. (One's a hose dragger… so… aka fireman). But all of them are good people. True friendship is love and support. My core group 

Unfortunately Yes. They were law-abiding, but were not “admirers of the police”. My younger brother, by a separate mother, used to speak out constantly against the police. I would even described him as always critical. I knew some of what he said were wrong, and without evidence, just like some people who ask questions or express critical opinions, on Quora about the police. I hid the fact that I had applied to the Police Recruiting Center for enlistment. The letter of acceptance came in the post box with the senders address, being “Ministry of National Security and Justice”. I was able to pass 

“As a police officer, did you completely cut off your not-so-law-abiding friends or family when you became a cop?” Nah. This isn’t the MIB. My family, father’s side, wasn’t happy. Why should they be? The Klan hasn’t had a good reputation with the police for years now. Oh, say, since before the ‘50s. And, they were perfectly content to lay low. They didn’t even vote. That’s kind of good, when you think about it. We didn’t need their votes making it worse for us. My mother’s side, eh. We had a lot of cops on this side of the family. Though, it would have been nice if they had warned me about how th 

I didn't have friends that were into anything serious. The biggest issue was occasional drug use. I told them my position on the subject and they kept it away from me and didn’t do anything if I was around. (If they are your friends they will accept you, if they don't then they aren't your friends.) But I was single for a good portion of my career and when I dated, I used to have to explain to a woman that if she is into anything illegal I can’t date her. I also told her no drugs in my home, car or in my presence. If she violated my rules she was out. I also told them if the were coming into my 

I'm not a copper, but I'll answer this on behalf of someone I know who is: no. Back in the UK, I played hockey for a men's team since I was about 13. At the age of 15, I got myself a fake ID, and went straight to the pub. After one of my matches, one of my friends mentioned: R: “Did I see you going into Spoons (a British pub) the other day? Me: “Yeah, mate! I've got myself a fake ID!” S: “Oi! Shut up! T is a policeman, remember!” T: *Wink* And then later (as he had for years prior) T turned a blind eye to me drinking beer in the pub. And in fact, he bought me more than a few pints after our matches;  

It was actually the other way around for me. My adopted family were all blue collar (oil and gas, rough necks, construction workers), beer drinking, pool playing. Saturday night fights at the local Y-Not Bar and Grill, and for the most none ever got past the 9th grade and God forbid one of us going to college. When I returned home after ny tour in the Air Force I found other than a handfull of my relations did not want to talk with me unless it was “how many ==&gt;]$# did you kill, Cuz. But when let it be known that I had taken a deputy sheriffs position and was starting college that was athe end.  

You kind of have to. Not because they do things you will necessarily have to arrest them on the spot for. However, guilt by association could complicate your work life. Say your cousin does coke. You borrow his car while yours is in the shop. There’s cocaine in it. You get pulled over and through a short chain of events the officer that stopped you found his cocaine. That’s now your cocaine. Just like that your career is over. We also had a department policy that we were forbidden with associating with known felons or members of criminal gangs (to include specifically named motorcycle clubs) tha

Answering this will be kinda difficult, because I have like 5 friends that are super close to my heart, so I will write about all of them but with their names hidden, so here we go 1- “Twilight” : a- Just by looking at me, he could figure out what I am thinking about, and sometimes he didn’t have to look to figure it. b- We bonded immediately when we first met and I am still amazed by how it happened, because at that time I wasn’t into making new friends. 2- “ Kai “ : c- He have his own world and he really doesn’t bother of how you would think about it. d- people always assume that we are brothers. 3 

Do you have any friends who became famous?
This is still really weird to me every time I think about it, but here goes. A number of years ago, I flew down to Southern California to take part in a cousin's wedding. My uncle was the pastor of a megachurch down there, and his wife hosted a Bible study group of girls at her home each week. I'd gotten to know most of these girls over the years, and grew somewhat close to several of them during the weeks we were there before and after the wedding. One of these girls was either dating or had just married a young man at the time. He came over a few times and we all sat on the floor and played ca

As for me, I'm friends with people I look up to and idolize, and that's an amazing experience whether they're famous or not. If you want to know *how*, the trick is to stand out obviously. How, you ask? Make them feel comfortable around you. They are constantly getting people who fangirl upon meeting them, so it'll be really refreshing to talk to someone who doesn't. I usually talk

Answering this will be kinda difficult, because I have like 5 friends that are super close to my heart, so I will write about all of them but with their names hidden, so here we go 1- “Twilight” : a- Just by looking at me, he could figure out what I am thinking about, and sometimes he didn’t have to look to figure it. b- We bonded immediately when we first met and I am still amazed by how it happened, because at that time I wasn’t into making new friends. 2- “ Kai “ : c- He have his own world and he really doesn’t bother of how you would think about it. d- people always assume that we are brothers. 3 

When dating, especially online dating, how do I bring up that I'm a loser? I want to be honest but I don't want women to be turned off by the fact that I don't have a lot going for me.
What would you think if a friend (with whom there was never even a kiss) invited you to dine with her, reiterating several times that if it was late you could sleep with her?
Since I foster open communication among my social circle, including making safe spaces for people to say what they feel and to accept and give rejection gracefully, I would think that my friend is saying exactly what she means. Friends can have meals together. I frequently dine with my friends, even one on one (well, I did before the world ended, anyway). Friends can also crash at each other’s houses, especially if it’s late and there are long drives ahead. All my friends have a standing offer to crash at my place if they come all the way out to where I live and it gets too late to drive home, a 

Well I think maybe she's saying IF ITS TOO LATE YOU CAN SLEEP AT HER PLACE not necessarily with her UNLESS SHE VERBALY SAID “sleep with me in my bed “ So I'd think since your “friends “ who've never shared a kiss together I'd think right away (unless she clearly said “sleep with her in her bed “ I'd think she simply means To SLEEP IN HER HOUSE but necessarly with her in her bed .UNLESS SHE STATED IT IN A CLEAR AND CONSISE MANNER .Your default idea should be UNLESS SHE WAS CLEAR ABOUT WHERE YOUR SLEEPING IN HER HOUSE .the default would be since your friends Is that yes you'll sleep in her home  

I can see how that might be a bit confusing. I would say what she meant, but didn’t say clearly, is that if it gets late you can just stay over night there at her place. That’s it, sleep, nothing more. Think of it as, woman lingo. The moment I read what you wrote she said to you I thought of the many times my female friends have said the same to me. It’s a figure of speech not a sexual come on if that’s what you’re wondering. I’m 99.9&amp;1/2% sure that I am correct in my interpretation. HOWEVER, there’s always that possibility that I could be wrong. If I am wrong and it gets late &amp; you decide to sta 

If there are no romantical feelings towards each other, I would think that she just wanted company for dinner and it f I was to sleep with her, then nothing sexual would be taking place ( because that IS possible) and also by her saying repetitively about sleeping with her, I would think she had too much to drink. However, sounds like she has been thinking about you as more than a friend for some time. She mentioned you sleeping with her lots of times because she was trying to read your thoughts on sleeping with her. If you weren't such a gentleman, you prolly could have slept with her that nig 

Sleep with her or sleep over? How long have you known this friend? Has she ever flirted with you or do you get the feeling she's into you more than just a friend? Is she attracted to men? If she said “sleep with me" than that's pretty direct. There's nothing to read into because literally that means sleep with me. If she said sleep over then I could see why you maybe reading into her words. The friends I have invite me &amp; my husband out to their place and typically if it's late they let me know that if we wanted/needed to we could spend the night. (Unless they already specified otherwise that I c 

I’d think that sounds nice. I like my friends, and a dinner and a sleepover sounds lovely, I’d almost certainly accept unless the proposed time crashed with something else on my calendar. There’s some chance that the friend in question has an interest in adding a romantic and/or sexual component to our relationship, how likely this is would depend on what our interactions are like in general though, and not just on this one invitation. (Whether or not I’d want that, would depend on how I feel about the friend in question.) Generally there’s open and honest communication between me and my friends 

Not crash — but sleep over? I think she’s far More than hinting that she like-likes you. Here’s a litmus test: Pretend you have a serious GF. Would your GF be OK with any of this? No? Why? Yah, becomes quite clear, doesn’t it? :) She’s asking for you to sleep in the same bed with her — she invited you over to eat at her place 1-on-1. She obviously at least wants you to want her. If you’re attracted to her — make a move. It’s quite obvious. She’s putting the writing on wall quite clearly. Which means even if she’s kinda screwball in the head and just wants you to want her and if/when verified she’ 

Maybe she's conveying something sneakily, but as a male, please don't take first step without getting a straight answer. Especially in such affairs which requires getting close. If she likes you, wants to go wild with you, let her say it straight forward. If you like her, express it in a friendly, decent and in a safe way possible. Let her pick up the hint, take you to bed and take it to next level. If she doesn't initiate, then just enjoy the dinner, thank her for hosting and go back to your home like a Good kid 😁 11 views · Answer requested by Michael RighiWilliam Deemer, Counsel men &amp; women on relationships for a decadeAnswered March 23, 2021 · Author has 57 answers and 25.1K answer views

Like many of the other posters, there’s a lot of gray area here that would need to be elaborated on to give the best answer. From what I can glean, you are just good friends and she wanted to have dinner with you and politely offered you a place to stay in case things got too late or you had too much to drink. Very few women I know, and I mean I don’t think I’ve ever met one, repeatedly tell me that if it gets a little late they’re going to “sleep with me” meaning have sex with me. Trust me most men would drag the evening out as long as possible. I’m pretty sure she was just referring to letti

Why does a woman who has rejected you twice say "You are the most terrific guy. Any woman would be lucky to be with you."? Why doesn't she jump on the opportunity herself and why is she BS'ing me when she knows I'm not interesting enough for her?
The first and most obvious reason is that she is trying to ease any pain of rejection you might be feeling. That's considered polite, so if nothing else, that would be enough reason. Of course, she might also be sincere when she describes you as a terrific guy and a good catch, though obviously not ANY woman would be lucky to have you. She, for instance, would not be lucky to have you — she would likely be unhappy if she was stuck with you. That doesn't mean you're not “terrific.” A man or woman can have plenty of terrific qualities and yet not be right for a specific partner. You could be kind,

She loves anything and everything that I gift her. Whether it be a safety pin or a beautiful dress, she loves it and treasures all that I gift her. 3. Her handwriting is very similar to mine. During school days, teachers used to scold me for writing notes or assignments for her. Finally we had to prove that we have similar handwriting. She did her bachelor's degree in Mangalore and me, in Mysore. I used to sent her greeting cards

Answering this will be kinda difficult, because I have like 5 friends that are super close to my heart, so I will write about all of them but with their names hidden, so here we go 1- “Twilight” : a- Just by looking at me, he could figure out what I am thinking about, and sometimes he didn’t have to look to figure it. b- We bonded immediately when we first met and I am still amazed by how it happened, because at that time I wasn’t into making new friends. 2- “ Kai “ : c- He have his own world and he really doesn’t bother of how you would think about it. d- people always assume that we are brothers. 3 

Why does a woman who has rejected you twice say "You are the most terrific guy. Any woman would be lucky to be with you."? Why doesn't she jump on the opportunity herself and why is she BS'ing me when she knows I'm not interesting enough for her?
The first and most obvious reason is that she is trying to ease any pain of rejection you might be feeling. That's considered polite, so if nothing else, that would be enough reason. Of course, she might also be sincere when she describes you as a terrific guy and a good catch, though obviously not ANY woman would be lucky to have you. She, for instance, would not be lucky to have you — she would likely be unhappy if she was stuck with you. That doesn't mean you're not “terrific.” A man or woman can have plenty of terrific qualities and yet not be right for a specific partner. You could be kind,  

I’ve gotten that a lot in my life. In my younger days, it was a source of frustration for me, so I understand why you feel put off by it. I used to joke that I’m the perfect guy for every woman’s best friend. But I’ve actually made a number of good female friends who started out as a date that didn’t go anywhere. It is quite possible to really like someone and think they are great without being romantically inclined toward them. And I’ve found that, if I put the whole romance thing out of mind, strong friendships can form. It always hurts to be rejected, but you can reframe it in your mind as a 

She probably does sincerely believe you're a terrific guy. That part doesn't have to be BS. The second part, “Any woman would be lucky to be with you,” is BS, however. If it were true that any woman would be lucky to be with you, she would be with you, and count herself lucky. The truth is, “Any woman who is attracted to you and compatible with you would be lucky to be with you, because you would treat her well.” But she probably lacks the awareness and precision to say that, so she falls back on a cliche. A sensible person chooses a partner based on a mixture of attraction, compatibility, and q 

I don’t know you or the woman in question, so I have no idea whether she really believes you’re a wonderful guy or whether she just THINKS she’s being nice and letting you down easy. Maybe she really thinks you’d be perfect for some other girl, or maybe she’s just trying to get rid of you without causing a scene. But ultimately, it doesn’t matter. You have been given the brush off. It hurts when a woman you love doesn’t feel the same way about you. But now you know: she isn’t interested in you as a boyfriend. So, forget about that and move on. Should you be “just friends”? That’s entirely up to  

About 45 years ago, a woman to whom I was deeply attracted explained that while I was her dear friend, romance wasn’t there. She thought I was likely to be a great husband, but not for her. I was a bit wounded for a while, but shortly resumed the friendship. It’s lasted all these years. She called me yesterday and we had a nice gabfest about our spouses, our kids, and other interests. We were warm and comfortable friends. I like her husband a great deal and clearly she made the right decision for her life, and coincidentally helped me find my love. Here’s the deal: if you truly cared about this  

It’s called “letting you down easy.” There are lots of reasons why someone might reject someone, and we couldn’t possibly know her reasons. There are also reasons why she would let you down easy: She doesn’t want to hurt you. Most people would rather not hurt other people, especially is they like them.She honestly likes having you as a friend and does not want to lose that. People whine about “the friend zone,” but really, being a friend is a good thing, if you can handle it. If you can’t, well, that’s nothing to be ashamed of. It can hurt to be close to someone when your feelings are at odds.Sh

25 years ago I met a manic depressive, ex-speed freak, man (hereafter called §). § was (to me) as unattractive sexually as it was possible to be. I was happily “married” (not legally, but in very other way) to another man, but § and me “clicked” mentally. I introduced § to my husband - they became friends. § met a woman (¥) I befriended her. It is now 30 years later. § still rings me up once a week for “a nice chat”. That girlfriend (¥) is still his girlfriend, even if she is now 77 years old. $ is a terrific guy. Any woman would be lucky to be with him. But “sexually attractive” he is not. Even  

The flattering reason for this is that she's aware that you'd objectively be "a catch" she just doesn't seem to be attracted to you because attraction doesn't function as a checklist. So "It's not you, it's me!", go and find the one/s you'd be perfect for! The less flattering reason (possibly likely, since she's rejected you twice and you're still arguing about it) is that women and girls get heavily socialised not to hurt the feelings of boys and men, so this tends to mean a "No" is couched in indirect and kind terms. This is partly because they get told not to be a bitch, and partly because t 

There could be a lot of reasons for that statement. Ultimately, she's not into you for whatever reason and you need to let it all go. Women are individual and each wants different things. You likely don't fill her wants/needs as they are right now. There are a lot of reasons for that. It could just be timing. Maybe you are the man of her dreams but she wants something else now. I doubt that, but fact is, you just don't know. Take her words to heart and believe you are a terrific guy and find someone who sees that and wants it. Obviously for whatever reason, you need to move on and she's trying  

People feel what they feel. I can objectively look at someone and say, “that person has the right kind of personality, sense of humour and ambition that I'd think they’d make a good partner”… but if I’m not attracted to them, it’s all meaningless. Either there’s a spark or there’s not. In my past I *wished* I was attracted to certain people because they would have been better choices for me but attraction simply doesn’t work that way. Attraction is involuntary. It’s not something anyone can control. She doesn’t feel it for you. She’s not BS’ing you, she’s actually complimenting you while at the sam 

My boyfriend hit me a while ago. He’s done this once before, but he always sincerely apologized. Is it worth throwing away a two-year relationship for only two incidents?
I’ve skimmed all the answers (but not all the comments) and I have a slightly different take on the matter than any of the other people who answered. It is based on my own experience with my first husband. One day we were arguing in the car and he backhanded me in the stomach. If i’d been expecting it and had my abs tightened, it wouldn’t have hurt so much but I totally did not even imagine he would ever do anything like that and it hurt like heck. I jumped out of the car at the next stoplight, took a route through a part of a campus so he couldn’t follow me in the car and then walked to my pare 

How exactly did he hit you? Was he in a blind rage, just looking for his assault to make contact somewhere, or did he seem like he was more aiming at a relatively harmless area like your rump or pudge (if you have any)? Was his regret instant or delayed by minutes/hours/days? How did he apologize? What was the fight about and most of all, who started the fight? Be objective when you answer these questions. You may see him as the instigator but always remain objective and look at things as if you were looking in the window of someone else's situation. Did he seem somewhat controlled when he hit  

To be clear, without understanding your exact situation it is difficult to provide targeted counseling, however, I have read a few answers that were appalling and some that were spot on. Couples in these situations stay together because of an emotional or psychological attachment that is a result of a combination of many different reasons, from a fear of independence or upsetting the current environment (moving from familiarity built over time into the uknown), to a lack of confidence and self esteem from years of verbal / physical abuse, making it challenging to end the relationship (“I'm not  

Absolutely. Battering only escalates. At first he’s sorry and apologizes profusely. But as time goes on he will say ‘You made me hit (or kick or push) you’. You say you have 2 years invested in this relationship, but in a year it will be 3 year, then 5 years. But no matter how much you tell yourself ‘It’s all over now, it won’t happen again” it does. And after a while your self esteem is in the gutter. You don’t know what to do; you think no one else would ever want YOU, so you stay. Then one day it goes from a single hit, to multiple hits and if your lucky you actually come out alive (many wo 

Yes, absolutely. Do you know how this kind of toxic relationship goes ? He has a statistically good chance of starting over and the next few times he might be more violent, Domestic violence is destructive, it’s not a simple relational problem, don’t let this man destroy your life. Forgiveness is useless, it will never change, On the contrary, it’s worse with time. At first, he is sorry and apologizes. But one day he will say: «You made me hit you" "You saw what you made me do" "You deserve it" and at that moment you can do nothing, Your life and physical safety will be in danger… Psychologically, y 

No matter the circumstances a man should never ever ever ever ever hit a woman. The fact that he’s done it twice, makes me think somewhere deep in his psyche he believes under “certain conditions” it’s ok to strike a woman. I’m 45 years old do you know how many women I’ve hit in my lifetime? zero. it’s zero because that’s a line I’d never cross. my advice to you is to say this to him. “Hey boyfriend there’s something that has been weighing on my mind. I can’t seem to get past those two incidences where you hit me. I know you’ve apologized profusely about your actions, but I’m starting to worry abou 

Would you rather err on the side of caution, or would you rather gamble your future, hoping, believing, that your boyfriend is “different”? You want to believe in your boyfriend. At least, that’s what I get when I read your question. He has apologized “sincerely,” right? When you’re dating, you’re not trying to make anyone change. Please remember that! You’re looking for someone who you may, or may not, want to spend your time, your future with. You’re looking for a partner, a person who you can do life with together. You’re looking for someone who can support you, and vice-versa. Because life  

“My boyfriend hit me a while ago. He’s done this once before, but he always sincerely apologized. Is it worth throwing away a two-year relationship for only two incidents?” There is no space for equivocation here. After one such incident, this person has solidly proven themselves as an absolutely unsuitable mate for you. His only hope is to find someone else whom he would NEVER DARE to strike for ANY REASON. As far as you are concerned that ship has already sailed and will never return. Apologies are self-serving in this situation - simply a means to not lose what he has. Tolerating a second such 

Most adult relationships, even marginal ones, never involve hitting, at least when you mean striking another person in anger or causing even slight injury. It’s a big, waving red flag, (and it was more than once.) Nobody can decide for you, of course, nor should we make guesses about whether it’s worth “throwing away a two-year relationship.” Still, when making important decisions about our lives, it helps to have a lot of input from various trusted sources, including “popular wisdom.” Popular wisdom can certainly be wrong, but as I understand it on this topic, there’s very low tolerance for spo 

The answer to your question is “Yes.” The “Should I throw away X because Y,” question is an issue of Sunk Cost Fallacy. As human beings, we don’t like losing things we’ve invested in because it feels like a waste of what we've invested if we bail. However, what’s done is done and what you need to consider is not what you have already given here but where you are right now. Where you are right now is in a relationship with someone who has hit you more than once. Matt Parisano does ask some good questions; what are the circumstances of these incidents?

What's it like to have your spouse cheat on you?
It's like driving your car and having someone cut you off, which runs you off the road; your car flips multiple times before coming to a stop. As you come out of a traumatic trance, you only to begin to take inventory of the real damage in the aftermath of the wreckage.  My wife had been cold for months. We were in our fourth year of marriage, but each successive year seemed to be an unraveling of our love into something that I could no longer recognize.  While we were dating, my ex was the BEST girlfriend I ever had. She saw me through an estrangement from my brother, my mother, the loss of a j 

Shorter answer: It feels catastrophic for a while, but the feeling subsides over time. It can indeed make you stronger. Longer answer: I figured out that my wife was cheating on me through a variety of avenues. Ultimately, it depended on me coming out of a state of denial and facing the shock. The first concrete evidence was a stash of letters. There was a cast of names that I didn't fully recognise at first, but I came to see that they were regulars on an online bulletin board site we both liked. The letters had a combination of breathless excitement over her new online BFFs, disdain fo 

12 hours in.... Feels like a bucket of acid in the stomach, and then some (despite taking all kinds of antacids). Can't sleep. Don't know how I'll get through the week, or even tomorrow, or even tonight. It was with a close friend, and now I feel like there's nobody in the world I can trust, or tell, or that can comfort me. She says absolutely nobody else knows, but how do I know that when I see any mutual friends that they really don't know, as opposed to them knowing and choosing not to tell me? She says none of her friends know, but I feel like everybody she knows or that he knows might have  

It's like someone takes your world, everything you knew to be true, and completely tears it asunder. You panic, you're scared, you can't believe it, your whole existence seems surreal in the worst possible way. Even if your marriage was troubled, like mine was, you don't expect it.  For two years, my husband and I had been struggling to (or so I thought) repair our marriage. We had young children, we were both making big life transitions - him to an extremely demanding job, me to a role as a stay at home mother. We'd lost some of our connection - I'd been responsible for 99% of the care of our c 

I actually feel the experience is different depending on the circumstances (as I’ve been cheated on online with dating accounts and such, and in “real life” twice as well.) The first time I was cheated on, I encountered it by accident - my long-term boyfriend had left his Gmail open on my computer after using it when he was sick, and I stumbled onto notifications for active sexting apps. There was a whole story he fed me about how his friend set him up as a joke, even got the friend to text me, and similar, but not long after I discovered unshakeable evidence. To sum up that chunk: I feel like a 

I was completely blindsided despite that everything was staring me right in the face.  I still have yet to recover and believe I'll face long term trust issues as a result. We'd been together seven years, discussed finally making babies but decided to put it off a couple months as a job transfer to another city looked like it'd be on the horizon. She started not joining me for gatherings with coworkers and friends, which in itself wasn't all that unusual periodically but she basically stopped coming out entirely. Then she started going out for dinner/drinks with friends and coworkers.  When she w 

Like my whole world crashed down on me. I was physically sick and couldn't eat. Lost 10 lbs in a few weeks. I was angry and jealous. I was hurt, I felt inadequate, and completely alone. Just devasted. We'd been married for 5 yrs, together for 7. We had 2 little boys together. We never really got along all that great. We had our good times though, and I honestly loved him and felt like I put 100% in our relationship and marriage. He had his anger and drinking issues. I just tried and tried to help him. Told him many a time that he needed to stop drinking and try to communicate more with me. He w 

In my situation I did not find out until many months after the cheating occurred. Initially, I had allegations from friends that, yes, it was true, I had been cheated on! I basically questioned my then-boyfriend who denied it through and through. You know that saying that people believe what they want to believe? Well, I believed what I wanted, and I lost no trust in him after he swore that nothing happened between him and this other girl. He even made me feel guilty by telling me I was unfairly accusatory. A few months later, a girlfriend of a friend of my then-boyfriend admitted to me that I  

I finally understood what women feel in abusive relationships and why they stay. It completely shattered my self esteem, self respect and sense of self worth.  I should've gotten therapy, but instead I went on to waste 10 years of my life with the same person (got three awesome kids out of it, so it's not all a total loss).   Let me back up.   My ex first cheated on me before we got engaged.  I was away for three months for work.  Turned out she was sleeping with her ex.  But I did  not find out until a few days before our wedding.

Now C was my best friend. He thought my wife was hot and I his. We had talked about swapping, played strip poker etc. Still my wife had had better offers. She had told me about some.

How do you get back at a narcissist?
The most respectful way, if you are kind to others and don't want that behavior to rub off on you, you should just not contact that person. Leave them alone. They are already suffering internally, more than you can perceive. What they think about themselves is said to you because the weight is too heavy to bare for them but that is not valid justification for abusive or negative behavior. If anything, getting them back just makes their illness worse and also makes you feel like the problem they say you are. It's a lose-lose. If a child misbehaved, do you put them in time out so they can sit and  

The best way to get back at a NPD is to move forward with your life, use this experience to learn about yourself on a deeper level, work at getting good with who you truly are and never look back.

Jamie, the best way to get back at a narcissist is, first of all, if you are carrying a load of anger for injuries you sustained, harboring grudges, including.. (the payback sort of grudges), continuous thoughts at the back of your mind consuming your every thought on “how can I make this still work?” to bargain with your anger issues….thinking.. that you still love this person sooo much that you will gladly let it go for another chance at making this relationship right or making it work.

I would suggest not doing it. For one nothing good will come of it. Why do ask? How do you know you are dealing with a narcissist? I ask because the term is loosely tossed around by people upset about the way a relationship ended or one considered toxic. The person is hurt and feels like they didn’t the closure or answers they want. There will be no honest heart to heart. There will be no accountability shown. When really if you are involved with a narcissist just go your own way even if you feel like doing something it won’t make you feel better. I guess that would be the best advice and reve 

All these people are gonna tell you this “no contact, move on and don’t look back” jazz, and it’s true, but they don’t understand. There is a difference between getting revenge vs getting justice. Revenge is petty and to be honest won’t bring a lot of satisfaction long term. Getting justice is different though. It’s more than just you. It’s how this person violated not just you, but basic humanity. It’s something beyond you. This monster is going around smashing up other peoples lives with no freaking consequences. No freaking blotch on their record. No trace of their abuse not just of you, but  

How to get back at the narcissist, how to get even or make them feel how they made you feel or at least give them a dose of their medicine! If you had a penny for every time a survivor asked themselves that question you would be rich for sure! The problem is if your talking about getting the narc to be EMOTIONALLY hurt or negatively affected by something you do to them then there is only one way to do so! In my opinion the best way to make a narc feel totally defeated by you and actually feel emotional pain, shame, embarrassment, guilt or maybe even regret is to FULLY expose them to the world or 

Be very careful trying to get revenge. A narcissist is a pro at games of revenge, has had many years of practice at deceit and manipulations, and has little or no boundaries. Even if they seem angry, they enjoy these games. Anything you do will be used against you to make you look like a crazy, bitter ex. Hell, half the time you'll be blamed for stuff you didn't do. Someone said post a bad review of him online. if he gets a bad review, he's gonna blame you whether you wrote it or not, and then he's gonna show everyone that bad review and tell everyone that his crazy bitter ex wrote it because s 

By far the most effective way is to act like the hurt never happened, and you are simply not bothered by what they did. That is a tall order when you are screaming inside, but it is devastating to the narc if you can pull it off. The narc is meant to control you and your world, and you are supposed to be destroyed if you ever split. Act like you are not, and the narc’s world order is upset. So if you ever bump into him or her, instead of glaring or bursting into tears, you give a big smile and a cheery wave, then sail on (things to do, places to go). You will leave behind a very confused narc. 

This question is actually a “catch 22” as consciously “getting back” at a narcissist is actually feeding their supply. You see, you wouldn’t feel the need to exact revenge if they hadn’t already succeeded in “winning” by upsetting you. It’s the functional equivalent of telling your childhood buddy his mom wears army boots after he denounces yours. Fucked up, right? Welcome to the world of narcissism! Where absolutely nothing is as it appears &amp; lying, cheating, manipulating &amp; controlling are the rules of this sick &amp; twisted little mind game.

I am getting angry right now. What should I do if a Korean girl wont date me? 😡
I am getting angry right now. What should I do if a Korean girl won’t date me? Calm down and leave the girl alone. There’s probably a reason why the girl doesn’t want to date you. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t find you attractive. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t like your personality. Don’t take it personally; after all, not everyone’s going to like you back. But if you only want to date a Korean girl because she’s Korean, then that’s just plain stupid and it makes sense why Korean girls wouldn’t want to date you. You’re literally fetishizing them.

Imagine a woman who you are not attracted to in the least, demands that you date her, and when you decline her offer, she becomes furious with you. You would think she has serious anger issues, you would be thankful that you avoided her, and she is a jerk. EVERYONE of us has liked someone who has not liked us back. Each of us has the right to say no, no matter how much the other wants to date. That is how it goes. You will survive this.

Learn to not! It's most likely an indication you are not happy with yourself. Let her go! Now work on yourself. You are mostly perpetuating the problem. You need to be okay with rejection and be positive about what you do have. A bit of gratitude goes a long way. So what do you enjoy doing? Go do that and let her go!

mainly, no offense but this is true, Korean families only look in people for their good jobs and their income like a doctor who makes 200k a year they would consider them a part of the family but if not you know they would just dump you. This wouldn’t be an offense because back then in ancient times they believed in power and wealth also mainly if you don’t respect the Korean culture and you don’t approve the eating ways then that’s a reason why they don’t want to date you and also begging and forcing wouldn’t make it better. 83 views4Cynth GrehnAnswered March 23, 2021Originally Answered: I am lonely and angry.

I saw this question/vent like for so many times and I assume you’re the same guy. Listen, first off if you’re in Korea, try dating apps. It might probably help you. I mean don’t lose hope, there are many half Koreans and half black kids so there might be a chance you’ll find one. It might take some luck or timing as well. Or just accept that korean girls might not be for you but you can try other asian girls that has a resemblance of korean girls features. Good luck and take break too. 84 views · View upvotes2Michael SchabowAnswered March 22, 2021 · Author has 894 answers and 132.2K answer views

Are you angry or frustrated? Deal with “you” first. Sit down and make a list of all your good characteristics, and then a list of all your bad characteristics. Think how you can make your “bad” list shorter. If you are enjoying yourself and life, then the girls will be attracted to you. But you must learn to be patient. It’s worth it. 101 viewsAnonymousAnswered March 23, 2021Originally Answered: I am lonely and angry. Why wont Korean girls date me? 😔😡

Man I try to help you, and you still keep asking the same stuff over and over. You are a goner man. You are done. Nothing more, I can say or tell you, because you are too autistic.

I wonder if you’re that same guy that said that Korean girls won’t date them because of their race? I guess it’s because those girls that you are desperately wanted to date refuse to date you because they’re scared of you or because they’re not ready to be in an interracial relationship with you. 69 views · View upvotes4Angela Susanne, studies Business (2026)Answered March 22, 2021 · Author has 1.3K answers and 208.9K answer views

Can a person who was never loved as a child accept love and give love in a relationship later in their life or will it always be 'alien' to them?
Is it inconsiderate to go to a restaurant a few minutes before closing time?
For me, it depends on the restaurant. If I am a customer and looking for a place to eat and it’s 9:00 or 10:00 at night and I pull up to a restaurant that has been busy and the staff is obviously exhausted and 5 or 10 minutes away from closing, then I am not going to be seated and expect to be served. I am going to go somewhere else out of respect for the fact that these are people, I am walking in at closing time, and they want to clean up and go home to their families. If they are that busy, they probably don’t need the last minute sale anyway. However, if I pull up to a place that is open,  

Where I work we try to accommodate anybody who comes in at the last minute but unfortunately we have a lot of people that do that I have had to reopen my register re-count it, stay an hour late because they waited in the dining room and wouldn’t leave had to restart the already cleaned grill, get all of the food back out of the freezer. I think you get my point yes it is inconsiderate and very inconvenient. Most restaurants try to close down and start the closing process early therefore have everything shut down and put up ahead of time so that they do not have to stay any longer than necessar 

It was 8:30 on a week night although, right at that moment, I didn’t know that was the time. I was out to get a bite to eat but I couldn’t decide. It’s a problem for me as a single 55-year-old. I like to read. I’m by myself. I love the food at a sit-down restaurant. I hate taking up a full table when there are couples and families nearby: “Look at that guy sitting by himself. Evidently couldn’t find anyone willing to eat with him. Hahaha, what a LOSER!” Anyway, I saw a BBQ place I hadn’t been to. It was part of a chain but I hadn’t been to this particular location. As I walked up at about 8:45  

In my personal experience, I can tell you it probably varies depending on what establishment you're going to. My last job at a local bar/tavern was very adamant on serving up until the very last minute. You could walk up to the register at 8:59pm asking for a double cheeseburger meal, and we would happily oblige. The manager there would make sure the kitchen staff wouldn't turn off the grill until exactly 9pm, yet somehow that was the one place I've worked at that we left exactly at the specified closing time. On the other hand, at my current job in the mall foodcourt, we absolutely despise the  

YES. I used to work at a restaurant that closed at 11PM, and we weren’t allowed to lock the doors until 10:50. The thing is, that doesn’t mean that we’re done serving at 11. It means that we usually have things shut down, cleaned up, and ready to go at 11. It’s not as easy as flipping a switch and leaving. The stove, deep fryers, ice cream machine, etc. all have to be turned off and cleaned before we can even think about clocking out. Some restaurants will tell you to get lost after their appliances have been shut down. The restaurant I worked at often had to accommodate the customer by turning b 

Despite the fact that eateries exist to serve people you do run some risks if you saunter into a restaurant 30 minutes before they close. Some of those risks are based on the attitudes of those employed there, some on the potential status of the kitchen. Many restaurants have a ‘pre close’ checklist. Things they do throughout the evening to make cleaning up at closing easier. This often means stopping the production of some food items, so you may not be able to get something on the menu that you’d like when you go in 30 minutes before closing.ice This isn’t cool, but it’s true (and this is me, c 

You can go any time you wish but don't count on getting what you would like or having friendly service. At least 30 minutes before closing time, people in the kitchen are starting to shut down fryers, flat tops ,etc down so the appliances can cool off a bit and get cleaned. Everything has to be cleaned before they can leave. Anything in the cooler has to have things up dated, floors mopped, , garbage cleared out, some food might need to be prepped for the morning shift, dishwasher thoroughly cleaned. Some places have to roll silverware for the next day..If an exterminator is scheduled for the  

Probably, but situations vary. And you can always ask. One night, driving home after working in Chicago—about a five hour drive—I stopped mid-way for a bite to eat at a popular restaurant. I entered at about 8:50 PM, looked on the door and it said “hours 11 AM - 9 PM”. Oops. I told the maitre’d I was eating alone, and asked if it would still be okay to get a quick bite. They said they could grill a quick steak, so steak, potato and a glass of wine is all I had. I sat at the bar and was out of the restaurant by 9:15. And I made sure to tip my server generously. I don’t think they minded, but I was 

No, absolutely not. First of all, these places need to post a sign that says NOT “closing time,” but “service ends,” or some such to remove the ambiguity. That said, if you walk in and they seat you, you are not being rude in any sense of the word to take a normal (not extended) period to eat. If they refuse to seat you and are a chain, report that to the area manager - (s)he will be delighted to know customers are being turned away (or will tell you “that is our policy,” in which case you never need darken the door again). Those who argue - especially one taco producer, who may or may not post  

I ask about closing times and the policy at the restaurant. If the restaurant closes at 10 and I don’t arrive until 9:30 I would definitely ask if it is possible to dine leisurely or not. All because… One time my husband and I were in a cheap place after a long workday. We intended to eat fast and be out by closing time..we are not ones to outstay our welcome. However, the workers were so eager to get out that they were sweeping all around us and singing at the top of their voices like they were trying to get us out earlier than the posted closing time. That was rude and definitely rubbed us bot 

What is the rudest thing someone said to you right after you had a baby?
What is the rudest thing you have ever seen someone do?
Last month, I was flying from Amsterdam back to Beijing, had a layover in Paris for an hour, with Air France. It is a late flight of 23.30 and arrive in Beijing in afternoon 16.30, but I have to get to office next morning, so I needed this flight to be as comfortable as possible, I booked an aisle seat with 20 Euros in advance. It is a two seats at the first row of three seats, so I was happy to pay. As soon as I came to MY seat, there was a guy seating there already, and I said to him “excuse me, this is my seat”.

While I was studying English and French at university, I took one year off and went to France as an assistant teacher, one of the things you were not forced to do but, according to university rules, was “strongly recommended”. I was really looking forward to spending a lot of time improving my language skills and giving some German lessons to French students to earn — at that time — a really respectable salary. Back in 1995, I drove an old Nissan compact car which, after driving from Germany to France and from France to Scotland and various other places, broke down completely. One of the guys in

In the early 1970s when I first arrived in Australia I was fortunate enough to reside in a harbourside apartment with splendid views of Sydney Harbour, the Bridge and the Opera House. I was employed in I.T. some 400 yards away in the city centre and my daily commute was a six minute ride over the harbour on a cute old ferry to Circular Quay. My home ferry wharf at McMahon‘s point was a rickety olde wooden gangplank some six feet wide with a single handrail on the left-hand side on departure. Now, as anyone who has ever visited or resided in England will know, queueing has been a major cornerstone 

Bashing me for not using tiktok. This might not be the stupidest thing but it is indeed a stupid thing. I had sent her a small video of a new born baby kid which I found very cute, to which she replied - share this bullshit with me on the tik tok app (for her a cute video of a kid is bullshit and making a fake lip dub video is a feat) and not on whatsapp, moreover she exhausted all of her 1.5 gb data just by downloading a 11 second video.

Some years ago my wife and I were in London, staying in Kensington. That morning we walked from our hotel and across busy street we saw a MacDonald’s. When the lights changed we walked across the pedestrian crossing to MacDonald’s, purchased breakfast and sat facing the pedestrian crossing and watched the busy morning traffic, the cars as well a the pedestrians as it was rush hour. After a while I watched an older gentleman walk his dog from left to right across this busy intersection. Directly in front of the MacDonald’s window, his dog adopted the position and proceeded to take a dump. When h

Since there was no more space for our onboard luggage, we had to put them a few seats behind ours.

Turns out that’s not what we got, but the seat number was very close, so we assumed. My husband had stored our tickets in the onboard luggage now stashed away and people were pouring in keeping us from getting them while an angry flight attendant kept on tell

At a local, store where we buy ammunition, there has been a bit of a feeding frenzy/buying panic. The store in their not so infinite wisdom decided that to keep their racks of ammunition from looking like the racks of toilet paper at Walmart, they would limit customers to only purchasing 2 boxes of centerfire ammunition and one box of rimfire ammunition per day. They are effectively rationing it. This isn’t the first time this has happened. I use 10mm handgun ammunition, (an unusual caliber for my locale) and only about 5 other people in addition to me here in town do as well. Only two of us sh 

How do you tell a bride that her wedding dress is inappropriate?
Before buying the dress.If you have been invited to give your opinion (for example, if you are invited to go dress shopping) you give your opinion. You can just tell the person that will wear the dress what you don't like about it. This can be personal taste, but that is what it is, taste. “I personally don’t like the color and I think it is cut too low, but other than that the dress is made beautifully.” - Taste “You are too fat for this dress.” - Taste (Also, put rather mean but hey, if that’s your usual dynamic, that’s ok.) If you think it is inappropriate, tell them why you think it is inappr 

You haven’t said WHY you think her wedding dress is inappropriate. I’m going to take two stances with you—one charitable, one not so charitable. Charitable: I’m going to assume that you mean well, that you care deeply about the bride (you don’t mention your relationship to her—are you her mother, grandmother, sister, cousin, best friend or just a random busybody?) and that the dress she favors is truly hideous. Let’s say that the dress is slutty (the words bride and slutty should never be in the same sentence!), or hoochie, or over the top in some way. If you’re her mother or grandmother or sis 

How do you tell a bride that her wedding dress is inappropriate? You do not. If you are her mother, her father, her sister, or her BFF, you are admitted to the privilege of dress shopping with her, and you have a point of view about her wedding dress, you may share it with her privately before her selection is made and paid for. If you are not, your role is to STFU about it. Why? because on the occasion of her wedding, you as a guest have exactly one obligation: to be polite. You don’t have to be effusive, but there is no planet on which it is OK to “tell a bride that her wedding dress is inappropr 

Well, a few thoughts, hope it helps. First you could find out (discuss with yourself) what do you mean by inappropriate, and why should your judgement be important to anyone else, especially to the bride. What benefit your opinion would bring into her life if you shared your two cents about her clothing with her? Would it be actually sg worth to be considered, or you’re just seeking self-validation when sharing your judgement? (measure it by watching yourself when sharing your opinion in another situation: do you feel better about yourself after it? Do you think sg like you are right? - if yes, 

Brides have a real relationship with their wedding dresses. It symbolizes herself and her relationship with her groom. It reflects her personality and the reflection she wants to show to the world. How do you tell a bride her dress is inappropriate? You don’t. This is her day. She has made all the decisions about it and her dress is the most important next to saying yes to her man. In reality, it is not about you and how you feel, it is about her. It’s all about her on this one day. Her dress may be hideous. It may show her boobs popping out everywhere. It may be tight enough to show every par 

This raises a very interesting question. What is the purpose of a wedding? Although people rarely think to do this, the answer can be found right in the words of the traditional wedding ceremony. It’s not just a celebratory party. There is a serious social purpose behind a wedding. Here’s a bit of the Episcopal wedding service as an example. Most other services have versions of the same thing. First come the familiar questions from the officiant to the people being married: Will you have this man to be your husband; to live together in the covenant of marriage? Will you love him, comfort him, hono 

Only if you are very close to her and can gently give input in a very wise manner. It would need to be very gentle and using the right words. Someone here said don’t do it. But if you’re close to someone and care about them I would do it in this way. “I feel you should reconsider this dress because I don’t think it’s the best for you. I think you can do better and in the long run it will make you feel more like a Queen.” There are ways to give positive input that isn’t corrective or judgmental. If we care about someone, shouldn’t we care enough to tell the truth in a very humble, gentle way, i 

How do you tell a bride that her wedding dress is inappropriate? If you value your life or your existence as is, ya don’t. There are very few things you can say “always” apply, but one of ’em is this: If a female of the bride category is to be wed, and she doesn’t say “Hey, let’s just go low-key, hit the courthouse and get this done.” then a few common facts can be assumed. Chief among them are… The dress is perfect in her eyes.It’s her wedding that she’s designed and it is perfect in her eyes.The only imperfections permitted will be the soon-to-be in-laws.Generally speaking, if the lady is concer 

You should never tell her that, unless you are shopping with her and then you should never say “inappropriate”…. because that doesn’t say “not the best for you” or “not flattering” or even “ugly”, it says “wrong for the occasion”. But who are you to judge this aspect? I agree to the underlying concept of bridal dresses being inappropriate for what used to be considered appropriate for a wedding in western culture. But as the whole wedding business has changed hugely, a lot of brides are influenced by what they see on the fringes. So, if you see a dress you deem inappropriate, do absolutely NOT 

I remember my mother-in-law saying that it's inappropriate to wear a white wedding dress and a veil because it is the symbol of virginity and nobody is virgin anymore on their wedding day.

To me, that is an inappropriate definition of inappropriate… Now if it's my siĺster/bff/daughter/close relative and I get to know what kind of dress she is planning to buy, I would suggest to her that she buy 2 dresses instead : one solemn dress for the ceremony and reception, and the 

If you are the boss and one of your employees calls in the morning and says that they "didn't feel good" when they woke up that morning so they're taking a sick day, would you accept that excuse as given or would you probe for a more detailed answer?
Here’s how I handled those calls… plus the second half of this is a horror story of what happens when managers don’t believe employees when they call in sick. As a manager and later as a Department Head – including when I was Director of Human Resources for two different companies - if one of my employees called in sick, I accepted that statement “as is”. I would thank them for letting me know, ask them if there was anything I could do and ask if there was anything I needed to take care of or be aware of on their behalf while they were out. I then said something along the lines of “take care of y 

Writing from a smaller country so don’t want to break anonymity. I worked in a large office. We had plenty of people who took sickies. I have no doubt that they were sickies due to timing and rumours that come back but you can never be sure. A girl who had been a young but conscientious worker had started taking a lot of sick leave. This coincided with a new boyfriend. My fellow manager told me I needed to watch her as she was no longer reliable and was more interested in her boyfriend than work. I had not noticed any change but I was only part time so I took it at face value. One shift she came to 

I worked in the Leisure Sector in the UK and in every one of my jobs was in a Centre operated by the Local Authority. They are not now. In every single one of about 8 jobs, the policy was the same. I would normally ask with what, but they were not obliged to tell me. There was no such thing as Sickness Allowance, but I did know people in other employment who ‘had’ to use their Sickness Allowance for their vacation because they’d run out of Annual Leave. I found that unbelievable. All sickness was paid, dependant on their years of service (Thank God for the NHS). We did have abuse of the system 

While I don’t have employees, I do teach college classes and attendance is an issue. Here are my worst attendance stories: One morning while I was teaching, I looked at one of my students, a young woman from Viet Nam who had English as a Second Language. She looked really ill and I asked her if she was all right. She said she had the Chicken Pox. I asked her if she was contagious. She said the doctor didn’t say she was contagious. I went on teaching and looked back at her after several minutes. Somehow, she looked even worse. I asked again if she was really okay. She said, “The doctor didn’t say 

I used to work in a call center for a cable TV company. As is usual for call center, there was an environment that was based on wringing every last drop of work out of their staff. We weren't people, we were resources to be used and discarded. Here are three anecdotes from my time there. A nice older lady lost her voice on the phones. She wanted to go home and rest her voice but was pressured into staying by the managers. The next day she was a bit better but lost her voice again by the end of the day. And again. And again. She took a couple of days off and went to her doctor. They couldn't fin 

Unfortunately this is extremely common for my employees. I have learned to just accept it instead of trying to enforce a strict attendance policy and then I keep track of these incidents and once a pattern emerges I bring it to their attention and give them one chance to fix it. I never asked questions because employees who are faking it well mention something extremely personal or something that will make you sound like a monster for questioning. Keep very detailed records regardless because I was sued by a former employee who had the absolute worst attendance issues I've ever seen in my life 

I completely agree with Dianne Dawson’s answer, that it is not up to a boss or anyone else to judge whether the person is sick. I’m adding my own comments because sometimes you can’t even tell when looking at or talking to a person that they are truly feeling bad, especially if they don’t have obvious symptoms, like runny nose, watery eyes, etc. When I worked and sometimes had migraines, I hated to call in sick because I didn’t “sound” sick on the phone and was afraid I wouldn’t be believed. Here’s a sad story that shows a person doesn’t always “sound” sick. I had a friend in a writers group of

For the first 15 years or so of my practice, my partnership had a very traditional type of leave policy. It was cumbersome and our in-house bookkeeper devoted a couple of days a month to payroll and leave administration for a small office of about eight employees, and another half-day straightening out mistakes, answering employee questions and fussing with the differences in tax treatment of different kinds of leave. When I went out on my own, I decided to do things differently. Before I hired a new staff person, I did a thorough local wage analysis, and set the pay for the position about 20%  

I used to give the day off - no questions asked. And to be honest, I never bothered if they reported it as a sick leave to HR. No point asking an employee to come in if they are not feeling up to it. I’d just ask them to login and check their mails if they could … and be available for a call or two, just in case (And I would always message them in advance if I wanted them to be on a call later on). I myself used to suffer a bit from what my boss called “Monday-itis” (He definitely was on to me), so I understood when that particular malady afflicted the 30 - 35 odd people who I was responsible fo 

How do I thank my boss for a pay raise?
How can I tell my mother in law to stop telling me what to do with my newborn? My husband won’t say anything because he doesn’t want to cause drama, but it’s getting to the point where she is rude about how I do things.
Let me start by saying that, from my perspective, this is between you and your MIL; I wouldn’t involve your husband. You’re the one she’s offending, and you’re the one who needs to be happy with the resolution. It’s possible she’s becoming rude because she knows you’re not interested. She probably thinks she knows better because she’s raised at least one kid. Chances are her ego is bruised. I suggest you have a chat with her and acknowledge how unpleasant things have become between the two of you. Let her know that you know she has more experience than you, but you need to do what feels right fo 

It's called manage from behind or manage from below. She wants to be given respect and expects that she's the one that knows best, because of her age and because of wisdom perhaps. She may have some good points to give you, but because of the dynamics it's hard for you to take direction and it's hard for her to be respectful, because she believes she knows best. This will not be easy for you to do, but let her take the lead say yeah why don't you show me that almost to the point of letting her do the work, because she has a control issue. Praise her where there is genuine praise like wow I nev 

I can sympathize with you on this. My mother in law was awful when I had my first child. My MIL would stand over me while I changed diapers, bathed, or fed my first born. She never offered to help with the baby. She never offered to hold the baby unless someone was visiting and she had to show that she was a “good” grandmother. After I had changed a diaper, bathed, or fed the baby she would offer her “opinion” about how I was doing things. Usually her opinion was a litany of criticism about the fact that everything I did was wrong. I didn’t use the right wash cloth in the bath. I didn’t put the  

When I had my son, just over 18 months ago now, my in-laws were the worst. They didn't consider it their “job" to be nice to my son, he was more like a doll they would play with and hand back when he showed signs of actually being a human being, like crying or wanting a nappy change. And everything I did was wrong, and I caught my MIL going behind my back telling my OH to do the opposite of what I said. We tried to talk to them about their behaviour, as it was completely out of line. In the end, after enduring them coming round every week being horrible to us for 9 months, I snapped. I told MIL 

When my son was born, my in laws came to visit and the ‘if you do this…’ lectures started. I was in the kitchen preparing lunch for us all when I heard my son crying relentlessly - there were three adults in the living room with him at the time, my husband and his parents. Not one of them picked him up as my mother-in-law was insistent that we would spoil our son if we did so, he was barely three weeks old! I went into the room picked my son up and cuddled him and then politely explained that a three week old was not able to manipulate us and the only reason for his crying was that he was unco 

Been there - done that. You have nothing to lose. She doesn’t like you anyway. People that like others do not abuse them. So when she offers, opens her mouth… just let her know this is your child. Give it to her very seriously, but calmly, and look her right in the eyes. End with - I hope you understand because I will not be repeating myself. Whatever it is you say, practice it in the mirror. Tell your husband in advance so he is not too shocked. He sounds like my husband was at first. I was left to deal with my MIL’s constant abuse. I told him that I will no longer take it, and he bett 

What you don’t get is that your MIL thinks she is doing the right thing. She thinks she is helping you. And maybe she is or could be. You are a new mother. You’ve just had a newborn. You’ve been through a lot. Surely you are exhausted. Why don’t you take advantage of the time your MIL is there and allow her to take over? Get out from under her control… bc that’s really what this is about. Whenever you are in a power struggle, drop your end of the rope. You don’t need her standing over you criticizing your every move so ,The first time That she does, hand the baby over to her. Politely Excuse yo 

Looks like you have some good answers already. I'm not an expert. But my late father was an outstanding pediatrician who started in the early 1960s… If you haven't considered it, scheduling a visit with him or her might be very helpful. This will NOT be the 1st time he or she has been asked for advice. I'd drag your husband along. This is really HIS duty.. if he's unwilling to take a stand for you now …Well…..That reasonably calls his devotion into question….. You married HIM-not HER. Maybe he'd prefer marriage counseling? Or maybe he should spend more time visiting THEM by himself until the message 

I had a mother-in-law that I respected, but she was a tough, old bird and had strong opinions. And more than once her opinions about child-rearing were different than mine. Shortly after the birth of my first child, she asked me, “Do you mind if I give you advice?” I was raised to be respectful of my elders, and although through the years I learned to speak more boldly, somehow I managed to say words that were then very bold for me. I responded, “Not if you don't mind if I don't take it.” Forgot all the advice that your husband should intercede for you (although he sure better back up your positi 

Ok, everyone cool your jets. A new baby changes the WHOLE family dynamic. Two people become first time parents, with all the attendant insecurities. Others just became grandparents for the first time. Grandparents have so been there and done all this baby thing before. Insecure first time parents see their confidence as arrogance. DIL’s in particular twist it all up in their heads that their MIL is an evil person who wants to knock the new queen off their throne. I don’t know what has gotten into this most recent generation of new parents. I adored my MIL. She was my go to for all my baby relat 

Have people ever tampered with a meal and then served it to a rude customer?
It happened once when I was an assistant manager at a crappy chicken joint (not KFC, the other one in the south, Z...).   I do recall what happened to that chicken sandwich...  The cooks were all black guys because the store owner was racist and sexist and only allowed the pretty white girls to work the front.  This person came in and we gave the food out like normal.  Well, it got sent back.  Why?  No idea.  It was made perfect.  So we decided to add the special sauce to the food.  The char patty got squished almost flat then dropped.  Twice, one for each side.  Then the bun was rubbed under  

I was a waitress for eight years. I met my fair share of dickheads. There were no constants: young or old; male or female; Swiss or foreign. I can't give you any statistic about your typical pain-in-the-ass customer. I have never served food, but I did tamper with 2 drinks on the same day. The first person was a man who brought his entire family for a drink, he arrived with 4 women, 3 men and 2 children. When I arrived at their table to take their order, his first question was: do you sell ice cream? To which I replied, "I am sorry, we don’t". It was summer and the ice cream was popular but we we 

I've told this story before, and I've had people call shenanigans on it because it smacks of justice a little too well served. But I swear it's true. I watched it happen. When I was a teenager (this was every bit of thirty years ago), I delivered for a family-owned pizza place. We did a box-office business; drivers would come back from delivery and just get handed a stack of new deliveries which had been prearranged for them. They'd head right back out the door fifteen seconds later. All they had to do was just take the deliveries in the order they were stacked. It was all pretty fast and loose 

When I was a kid, I worked at a pizza joint for a while. It was a small town and there was only one pizza place. We closed at midnight on weekends. We usually started cleaning and getting ready to put things away for the night and the next day’s shift about an hour before locking the doors. We stopped taking orders 20 minutes before closing. Every Friday night, the local high school football team would come in around 11:30 PM and trash the place for fun. After a few weeks of this, the manager contacted their coach and told him about his team’s behavior. When the team got scolded. they came in  

Absolutely. It happens all the time.   These stories I have heard from reputable sources: Casual Dining Establishment: Customer comes in every Tuesday with his wife. They are miserable people.  They leave a 50 cent or less tip on a ~20$ bill.  Every week the man orders a 1/2 lb burger with veggies on the side.  One particular time he flips out on the waitress, calling names etc.  Burger is undercooked, veggies cold.  Kitchen staff had just swept the floor after chipping away at the nasty stuff that collects on a flat-top griddle.  Burger gets put back on flat top and those floor "spices" are lite 

When I was 19 I went out with this total prick, only he was my first boyfriend, so I didn't know any better. He was particular about EVERYTHING and was very vocal about how stupid he thought everyone else was, because they didn't get the “essence” of the points he made about everything which bothered him. He was the kind of asshole who spoke to waitstaff slowly and loudly as if he was giving directions to a puppy that he intended to whack with rolled up newspaper should they pee on the carpet. In short: this jerk was begging for his food to be messed with. So there we are, at a breakfast joint in 

My first awesome experience at Popeye’s. I remember that one day as a janitor I saw this very annoying teenager in my restaurant. He kept getting mad at the cashier because she kept asking to repeat himself. The cashier girl was new at the job, only two days in. I became mad as well, but I decided not to do anything. Eventually, the boy gets his food, and he sits down with his food. Suddenly, I looked at him, his face was red, as if he is going to explode. He pushed the tray off the table and food spilled all over the floor. He stomped up to the cashier and said she got his order wrong. This man  

For a period of time, I worked in the pizza industry. I worked for the big 3 pizza restaurants: Pizza Hut, Domino’s Pizza, and Papa John’s. I must have worked for a dozen smaller chains also. I did everything imaginable in the pizza business including management and owning my own restaurant. Having said this, I’ve seen everything that could be done to a rude person’s food not just from the cook but from the wait staff and delivery drivers. Let’s talk about drivers since they are high-profile and out on the street, so they are the most visable. First off, you have to realize that a driver never f 

In the late 80's I worked at a well known pizza establishment as a delivery driver who would sometimes help out in the kitchen when deliveries were slow. There is something about pizza that really brings the odd people up front and center.  We never failed to get at least one complaint per evening.  Most of these were minor, like "not enough meat", or "needs to be more crunchy, things like that.  Most of these are very simple to remedy, and of course everybody wants a good pizza and the definition of good varies somewhat. A pizza in this establishment was not cheap, nor were the product guidelin 

I worked as a server for 22 years in restaurants and only twice saw anyone tamper with a meal no matter how awful the customer was. Once it was the chef, reacting to a customer who came every Sunday and complained about everything and the other time I did the dirty deed. Both times I had absolutely no problem giving the customer the food.       I've worked in fancy restaurants and casual restaurants and really loved the job.  I've dealt with people telling me I "was lying" when I explained that their order was taking so long because he had made substitutions that the cook had to prep from scr 

What is the rudest thing someone said to you right after you had a baby?
plot twist i was the rude one… Long answer ahead… p.s for confidential purposes im switching the names. My father- Joe Stepmom- lily My mother passed and eventually my father got remarried, this lady was alright. I didnt hate her she just wasn't my mother, she was my father's wife and thats what I thought of her as, nothing more. They got married and by then I was 12, (side note- this lady is depressed and has panic attacks), anyways one day its just us, she takes me out to lunch and we are having a good time, while we are out she tells me its okay if I want to call her mom and she would like that  

When, three weeks after a partial placental abruption, I went to the hospital after some six hours of regular painful contractions, the female OBGYN (practice partner of the male OBGYN I had seen throughout my pregnancy and of whom I was a private patient) told me with a sneer that I was not in labour, although she did not examine me or even come into the room, but just stood in the doorway. Nevertheless she ordered that I was to stay in the hospital. There was a change of midwife, and the one that came on duty discovered that I was in fact in labour but did not bother to notify the OBGYN. I p 

Oh wow I’ve been waiting to answer one of these! And I have just the story for you all. I am a mother of 4 beautiful children, I know every parent says that, lol anyway my kids are 8(f), 7(f), 5(m) 4(m). My husband has a group of friends. They have been “boys” since they were kids. After high school they all still hung out and played pc and console comes online together- (still do to this day). I’m pregnant with our oldest son, they all would come over and spend time with the kids but due to busy schedules all couldn’t be around for about a month. In that month I had our son. Mind you this was  

Oh goodness, this is one I will never forget. My son was born by emergency C-section because he was trying to force out before I was fully dilated leading to stress. When he was born, he was brought to neo-natal for oxygen. Overall, he is fine, even today but when he was born, he had what my partner and I call “Boxer’s nose” he pushed down (or to say, my body tried to force him out) so hard it dented the top of his nose. Due to issues outside of the norm (my narcissistic mother) my partner and I got a DNA test done so to ensure she could not try and get my son if anything happened me, needless  

I found love a little late in life. At 37 I married the most wonderful man I’ve ever known. I’m white and he is Spanish, born in Mexico. After a horrific car accident in 2003 I was told there was little to no chance I would ever become pregnant. In 2008 I was being admitted to the hospital for a procedure related to a suspected heart defect I had been, unknowingly, living with. I was routinely checked for pregnancy and surprise, surprise I found out that indeed I was in fact pregnant! Miracles do happen! My excitement was beyond words. After a worrisome pregnancy due to my age, heart and after 

I was 18 when I got pregnant. The father wasnt in the picture during or shortly after the pregnancy, my mom was a little disappointed in me but she went through something like it before when she was 16 (only difference is I used protection when she did not and it failed). My dad was furious at me and to this day I still dont understand why. He would constantly talk down on me, get really drunk and call me a whore, slut, skank, etc. After I had my son it got worse, our mailbox was directly beside our front door and I would check the mail while having 1 foot in the door. My dad had already gotte 

The rudest and most insensitive someone has ever told me…. It was my Dad. I delivered a sleeping baby so she didn't help at all and after a crazy labor work I ended up ripped off, I had 5 stitches in between my legs…… Next day at night, one of my Dad's sisters decided to drop by (she knows we dont like her but since my Dad was visiting she decided to show off) she brought Chinese food, a dominoes table, music and dominoes… and the party started. My husband and I were EXHAUSTED so we stayed in the living room with them (we decided to play cards sitting in the sofa) but we participate on anything 

When my daughter was born we lived in a TINY mountain town. Our town only had one 3 way stop sign. That's it. The nearest hospital (and where my OB was located) was about a 25 minute drive through twisty mountain roads. The maternity ward had a grand total of 3 beds. My impatient little lady decided to come early. I'd been on bedrest for about a month at this point, and had already recieved a shot to boost her lung development as they were anticipating an early arrival. She was born looking perfectly healthy, but the small town doctor ( who by the way is, hands down, THE BEST, doctor I've ever  

My newborn baby’s grandmother asked me “Why didn’t you have an abortion?” as she was holding her new grandchild for the first time. I was 18 when I got pregnant. Even though I wasn’t raised Catholic, I did attend school in a Catholic system and in 12th grade we were shown that famous anti-abortion film “The Silent Scream”, which I have since found a rather disgusting thing for a teacher to do* (this film is nothing but propaganda and filled with lies). When I learned I was pregnant I kept thinking of what I saw in that movie and couldn’t have an abortion. I didn’t have a boyfriend. The father

After 18 hours of being rolled around in my bed I finally started active labor.

What are some of the subtle ways Queen Elizabeth shows her disapproval or dislike of a person? She is known to be polite under all circumstances.
During social occasions, it is customary for all those due to meet Her Majesty to form a line. A Royal aide, who stands just behind Her Majesty, tells her the name of the person she is meeting and what they do. Her Majesty always begins every conversation. The Queen did not attend school, neither did her younger sister, Princess Margaret. Both were taught at home by tutors and/or a governess/nanny. From all accounts, the sisters’ education was not particularly comprehensive. As a result, Her Majesty has had to teach herself about geography, history and politics, to name just a few subjects. Con 

The Queen would never visibly or verbally show a dislike for someone she was speaking to. She would also never publicly criticise somebody. This is because as sovereign the Queen must be seen to be neutral. However when the Queen is at an engagement or a function her assistants control who gets to speak to her. Usually, all of the guests form a receiving line and in turn, are introduced to the Queen (and any other Royals). Due to the number of people and the short space of time available, it is usually no more than a brief introduction which lasts less than a minute. After this, her staff choose 

She is very serious about punctuality, and it annoys her a lot if she is kept waiting. Recently a cleverly cut piece of footage was released showing her storm out of a photo-shoot after an American reporter asked her to remove the crown, as it looked too dressy, but although this did annoy her, the footage of her storming out was taken out of sequence. Even if she wanted to, the Queen is professionally dressed, so to take it off would have required a team to re set her hair, and Liebowitz was foolish to think otherwise, and in another twist, she dislikes wearing them anyway, as they are heavy, 

Her handbag.  Notice how she always has her handbag by her side Queen Elizabeth II is always seen with her iconic handbag. In fact, she has been using almost identical handbags for more than 60 years. When you think about it, usually leaders and important figures have people carrying around things for you— so there really is no need for the Queen to carry a handbag. So why does the Queen carry one? It’s because she likes it, right? That’s partially correct, but there’s another function that the bag holds— it’s part of the Queen’s secret code. That’s right. The Queen has a secret code. Because it’s rare 

Nobody bothered to mentioned the times the Obamas offended Queen Elizabeth. In 2009, the first time the Obamas met Queen Elizabeth, Michelle Obama hugged Queen Elizabeth. And in 2011, at a State Banquet in England given in President Obama’s honor, Queen Elizabeth “humiliated President Obama by not accepting the toast” he made in her honor. Those are facts. I did not make them up. Today, however, the Obamas and the media sweep those facts under the rug and try to explain them away. I am certain Queen Elizabeth in all her royalty and graciousness does not hold grudges. But, I also bet she does no 

Her Majesty is the epitome of Protocol and Etiquette. Over the years, The Queen has developed a system of very subtle codes, which are understood by Courtiers and staff. Cleverly, believe it or not, part of that system includes the positioning and placement of Her handbag. If at a State or formal dinner, if The Queen places Her handbag on the table, she is ready to leave in 15 minutes. If at another function, such as a reception line, if The Queen shifts Her handbag from the left to the right arm, it is the signal to wrap things up. Alternatively, prior to an Audience or meeting, Her Majesty will i 

Aahhh…yes. Time to roll out the time my grandfather upset the Queen. He worked as a painter for the Department that maintained the fences, railings and buildings in various places in the UK. He was painting the Palm House in Kew Gardens one day when a couple of corgis start playing around at the bottom of the ladder he was on. One rule my grandfather had was that if he was on a ladder you did not get close to it. So, these corgis are playing around at the bottom of his ladder and my grandfather starts muttering about people needing to keep their dogs on a leash, it’ll cause an accident etc. He 

Apparently, the Queen has a selection of ‘looks’ and movements that show her staff how she’s feeling at any given time - they know what each one signals, it’s the ‘code’! There are some looks you don’t want to be on the receiving end    And then you get these - and you know all is well:    

I heard a radio interview between a journalist and (I think) Australian cricketer, Dennis Lillee. Dennis described how when he met the queen he made a mild irreverant joke not in keeping with protocol. The Queen had politely replied, “How very amusing for you.” Dennis was left feeling sheepish. He had been put in his place. I can’t remember for sure if it was Dennis himself who told this anecdote, so if you want confirmation, ask Dennis, or ask the Queen. 5.5K views · View upvotes314Claude Lambert, Retired scientist.

I remember noticing that she was not impressed by the dress of Princess Diana during the wedding, just the way she looked at it tells you!

What are the secrets of being likable?
13 Habits of Exceptionally Likeable People By Dr. Travis Bradberry  Too many people succumb to the mistaken belief that being likeable comes from natural, unteachable traits that belong only to a lucky few—the good looking, the fiercely social, and the incredibly talented. It’s easy to fall prey to this misconception. In reality, being likeable is under your control, and it’s a matter of emotional intelligence (EQ).

Too many people succumb to the mistaken belief that being likeable comes from natural, unteachable traits that belong only to a lucky few—the good looking, the fiercely social, and the incredibly talented. It’s easy to fall prey to this misconception. In reality, being likeable is under your control, and it’s a matter of emotional intelligence (EQ). To become a more likeable person, avoid doing these things: 1. Humble-bragging. We all know those people who like to brag about themselves behind the mask of self-deprecation. For example, the gal who makes fun of herself for being a nerd when she rea 

How to be a likeable person? First you have to forget about trying to be likeable. Yes, that is most important advice I would give. Because I have been in that position before. I lowered myself so that people will like me, so that they will make friends with me. Someone ordered me to say sorry to her 100 times then she will consider befriending me again. And I did. That’s how much I want to be liked by others. Someone asked me to give her my birthday present that was prepared and given to me by the teachers. And I did, even though I’m freaking happy to receive my first ever birthday present from 

I learned the secrets of being likeable from a waitress named Debbie. I was working in a high end restaurant as a cocktail waitress. The place was known for its steaks and was a hot spot for business men. The lunch crowd was made up mostly of suits and ties; a lot of powerful guys who wore nice watches and who all had sort of a new car scent about them. The tip potential from a single shift was huge. Most of us were young, broke waitresses; we quickly got to know the customers and could spot the big spenders the minute they walked through the door. You basically had one shot at gaining a customer 

One way to be likable is to become a good pet. Make yourself entirely unthreatening and not unduly annoying or burdensome. Meekness, cuteness and servility are of the essence; obey, fawn, and know when to get the fuck out of the way. But if you want to be a person of some substance and accomplishment, and still be likable, then you have a far more challenging road ahead. In this case, the quality you must develop is not called “likability” but charisma. Here are its ingredients: 1 — Be excellent You’ve got to be very good at something we value. This is entirely context relative. It could be someth 

In a study conducted at UCLA, subjects rated over 500 adjectives based on their perceived significance to likeability. The top-rated adjectives had nothing to do with being gregarious, intelligent, or attractive (innate characteristics). Instead, the top adjectives were sincerity, transparency, and capacity for understanding (another person). These adjectives, and others like them, describe people who are skilled in the social side of emotional intelligence. TalentSmart research data from more than a million people shows that people who possess these skills aren’t just highly likeable, they out

I will tell you about a girl who was my friend until high-school, after which we moved on to different paths. But, she was that person who was liked or I might add loved by everyone. No one disliked her. I used to wonder her secrets of winning people’s hearts but then I wasn’t mature enough to understand her popularity. After high-school to even now, I have met quite a handful of people who are just as much liked as her. I am not so much a people person due to the heavy amounts of introversion but one positive aspect of it is me being observant to my surroundings. I have observed all those peop

How do I become more confident while talking to people? I’m not even twenty yet and this has ruined most of my life.
Conversing is an art. Thus it requires practice. The more you talk to people the more confidence you will gain. But first the essentials of speaking to another human: Remember that the person you are talking to is not William Shakespeare. He's just another human. You don't need to be nervous. He couldn't care less if you use fancy words. All you need to do is put across the essence of what you are trying to say.Eye contact.

Wear Comfortable Clothes It may sound silly, but I promise there’s something to this.

This can trigger anxiety and make you overthink things. Wear clothes that feel great

I had a similar problem when I used to be the small, fat kid in school, since being mobbed destroyed my confidence. I started getting involved in self-improvement, and even though I lost most of the unnecessary weight, I became more charismatic before that happened through certain exercises and a shift of mindset. The truth is, you are nervous when talking to other people because you probably have low self-esteem and depend on the conversation to go well because you want to be liked by the other person. So what you need to do is change the way you think about others. These were some of my reali 

Ok so, I will throw in my two cents even though others have responded. What I have done to boost my confidence is: 1.) Self reflect: This meant that when I was alone I thought about many of my flaws and began to think “ok, I don't like this part of me… How can I improve?” and I would research A LOT about psychology. So basically get to know who you are and accept the flaws that you aren't working on at the moment while still having them on the back of your mind to work in the future. 2.) When you walk, walk with your head looking straight. If you look down constantly it makes it easier to be self

I used to be extremely shy. It seemed weird to people who knew me because at work, I seemed to have everything under control. But take me to a party or any public event, I would go completely numb. I would stay hidden in a corner and have nothing to say to anyone. If you managed to say hi to me, you would get a scared look and no response. I was that bad. I had agoraphobia from when I was 11 to 30. For those 20 years of my life, I was scared of going to public places or meeting new people. I was great at my job but totally inept when I had to meet new people or go to public places. I was the qu

The previous answer is right you won’t ever be the person you used to be. You’re constantly moving on with life and this is just a fact. It’s sounds to me that not being able to go back to the way you were is depressing you. It can be depressing when you think about it. You think of your old self and all of the great things you used to do and the way you used to feel good about yourself. You might be comparing this nice version of yourself to how you feel now: lost, anxious, desperately sad or depressed. Comparing the two just like comparing yourself with other people isn’t the best thing to do

Trust me, I also struggled with this but slowly but surely you can have a better, positive and more improved mindset but you have to be patient with yourself. Don’t go too hard and think it’ll change in 1 day. First of all, your mindset is the addition of the knowledge you’ve acquired including your beliefs, morals and how you feel towards the world. Secondly, your personality is who you are and changing it is not that simple. You can develop traits and habits that make you the person you want to be meaning you can change aspects of your personality you’re not very happy with. I’m no expert bu

If you could, you would have invented the cure for personality disorders. You will be filthy rich within no time, as you are able to do what no psychiatrist has been able to do before.  You cannot change your personality. Your personality is part of your sub-conscience and before you will be able to even reach that, you will be years further. Before you will be able to manipulate it just a little bit, add a couple of more years. Changing your complete personality.... A

How can you ensure you’re constantly improving?
 Here’s one hack I do to constantly improve myself. It’s just one way. And this one way has allowed me to improve in so many others. 8 ways. 80 ways. 800. I never thought of specific numbers when finding ways to improve. It’s always been impromptu. That’s because I’ve trained my mind to subconsciously be on the lookout for small weaknesses in my armour. I’ve trained my mind to go through pain barriers of finishing up workI started regardless of how my body feels. This hack is very accessible to any tom dick and harry sitting at home.

You will suck at everything: When you start something for the first time, be it a new business, a new job or learning a new language. You will be terrible at it no matter how high your IQ is. Everyone who starts something new will suck at it at first, however most people don’t start or pursue something new just be cause they expect to hit the home run in their first attempt. If you lift weights in a gym for the first time you will realise how weak you are and your body will ache terribly the next day. When you start to learn a programming language for the first time, most of the things wont ma

Since you specifically asked for 8 I’ll give you my top 8. These are all equally important in my eyes so I can’t rank them in order. ReadingThis should be obvious but nowadays people take this for granted to the the extreme. Yes, you can also listen to podcasts and audible books. I’d recommend something that requires you to think/learn while at the same time being something your interested in. Tell the truth or at least don’t lieAgain, obvious right? Yet people seem to constantly ignor this. It’s important to know why you shouldn’t lie. Jordan Peterson explains the best but I’ll attempt here. Wh 

 Derek, Develop Discipline. This is perhaps the most important skill that you can develop, as you can build a ton of things on top of it. It’s sort of like a great foundation. Discipline is a rare skill, because it requires you to ‘show up’ in spite of emotional or otherwise irksome circumstances. When you develop discipline, you develop the ability to improve other aspects of your life in turn. Think about how much better things in your life could be with an increase in discipline. Your relationships would improve, your work would improve, your fitness would improve,

You only need one: DO WHAT IS HARD!  There are already enough eight-step methods in this thread already without me adding to the noise, but if you look at all the ways mentioned so far, all of them revolve around you exerting some kind of effort beyond what you are currently used to. Whether that be journalling, goal-setting, challenges, meditation, or…hair replacement (as I noticed in one interesting article)…the common denominator amongst them all are you choosing the harder option. And you know this already! You know that anything that is worthwhile and purposeful in life requires above-average  

1. Read a book every day. Books are concentrated sources of wisdom. The more books you read, the more wisdom you expose yourself to. What are some books you can start reading to enrich yourself?

Keep quietDon’t go around boasting of your decisions or attempts to improve at something. Yes, people will be impressed with your willingess to change, but that will trick your brain into thinking it has already accomplished the task and thus, you may lose your motivation.  The less you talk about your goals, the more likely you are to accomplish them. 2. Have a goal No matter what you want to get better at, you need to have a clear vision of what it is you want to accomplish. Once I was in a bookstore and decided to get a unique writing pad. I kept looking and didn’t like anything I saw. Then I re 

For constant improvement, stop thinking of your progress in terms of the step function:  And instead, think of your progress in terms of the exponential function:  You can’t constantly improve by putting in a large, one-time effort. You need to do small activities that compound over time. However, you can go wrong with this analogy if you think that an exponential rise in progress happens only through an exponential amount of effort. Depending on effort alone will trap you in the step function. You will work very hard but eventually reach a plateau because you’re human. There’s only so much that you 

How can I develop self-confidence and self-esteem?
 They key to Developing your self-confidence is basically doing the things that seem Hard or Impossible without thinking, basically to develop confidence or esteem you need to learn to be your own master capturing your own mind and mastering self control, you need to give orders to your mind and control it whenever it keeps telling you to do the opposite, you have to constantly challenge yourself doing the hardest things which will push you out of your Comfort zone on daily basis, the comfort zone is always comfortable and we as human beings always get stuck on that being lazy that’s why we nev 

Self-esteem is the way you feel about yourself. It is an important aspect of your emotional well-being. Knowing your self-esteem is the first step to any kind of progress and happiness in life. If your inner voice (or thoughts about yourself) are mostly critical, you most likely have low self-esteem. That means, the process of boosting your self-esteem starts with deciding that you are valuable and treating yourself as such. Self-esteem is whether you believe you’re worthy of respect from others, while self-confidence is whether you believe in yourself. Self-esteem and self-confidence go hand-in-han 

I had an idea. Tell me if you like it. I loved the idea of living in hotels. What sort of person could live in a hotel? Did you have to be rich? Sometimes. At the time, I lived in The Chelsea Hotel in NYC. If you ever saw the movie, “Sid Killed Nancy”, you know the hotel. If you saw the movie, “I Shot Andy Warhol”, you know the hotel. It was the tallest building in NYC when it was built. It was ornate, it was disgusting, it had bad art all over the place because artists would pay their rent with paintings. My next door neighbor was a drug dealer and middle-aged women would sometimes form a line ou 

Dress nice. Beleive it or not but you will feel better if you are neatly dressed up and the same can be seen on your face. It has a large impact on how we perceive ourselves. If you feel look nice,you will automatically feel confident.Reward yourself. No achievements in life is big or small. Reward yourself even on completing a small task. It will greatly boost your self esteem.Face the fear. There is no shortcut to gain the confidence. You have to face it. You may fail initially or feel uncomfortable but who cares.

When I hit rock bottom I was left with zero sense of self. Everything I thought I was and was going to be, evaporated along with the closing of my first business. I had to start from scratch and was completely depressed. I had low self esteem. What was I passionate about? What were my strengths? Who the hell am I? I had no idea. I was completely lost. Seeing happy people doing well would piss me off. I knew I had to do something to build myself back up. And what I realized, as cliche as it sounds, is that it’s not about the destination. It’s about being with every step of the journey. And the key  

Lots of great answers. I'd like to share neat little trick I've learned... Act self-confident. To act self-assured. No one will know that deep down, you may think you're an insecure loser. Which you aren't, of course, but we humans are capable of telling ourselves the most deranged lies.  No one needs to know you feel insecure; no one will know. So if you appear confident, especially by displaying optimal body language, you'll end up increasing your actual confidence. After all, you have to practice it to attain it; no one is born completely confident in themselves.  Some specific tips on how to  

 1)Become more self-aware It is more than likely that if you have low self-confidence and self-esteem it`s probably because you have a lot of hidden fears and insecurities. Part of the remedy for overcoming these is to own up to them and acknowledge them as being a part of who you are now. I am not naturally good at taking criticism. I want people to just agree with everything I do and not be too discerning about the actions I take or the work that I do. I know this is wrong, but I acknowledged it a long time ago and I work on taking the criticism as being constructive and helping me to get better a 

Talk to a stranger. Make it a habit to talk to someone new everyday. Could be someone you meet at the grocery store, random stranger online, or the neighbour with dog few yards away from your home.

Since my last few posts I’ve been getting messages regarding confidence, self-esteem and how I appear to be so confident. First, let me start of by saying that confidence is not something you are magically ‘born’ with for most people, including myself. I like to visualize confidence as a muscle that you can grow and grow, as you train it. Even if you are shy and have low self-esteem right now, you can ABSOLUTELY change that if you want to. Here are my top 5 tips that helped me develop KILLER confidence: 1. What people think of you is NONE of your business. Also - people don’t really think of you. A 

Self-confidence refers to how you feel about your abilities with respect to a given activity. As such, confidence is bound to vary from situation to situation. Self-esteem refers to how you feel about yourself on the whole. In other words, how much self-regard or self-love you have, how comfortable you are with who you are who you are becoming. A person could have high confidence but low self-esteem, or vice versa. For instance, someone is an exceptional singer. Ask them to sing before a crowd and they will leave the audience spell-bound. Yet, they might walk off the stage thinking that this is a 

How can I accelerate my personal growth efficiently?
Get In Over Your Head. Work To Get Your Head Above Water. And Do It Over And Over Again. In other words, choose "anxiety-driven growth" over "boredom-driven growth". To explain what I mean, I'll use Jesse Schell's elaboration on Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s flow diagram:  For Csikszentmihalyi, flow is a magical zone between anxiety and boredom. The vertical axis represents the size of the challenges we are facing. The horizontal axis represents the power of our skills in relation to those challenges. When our challenges exceed our skills (in the upper left part of the diagram), we feel anxiety. When ou

 When I was in my early 20’s I went through a rough transition that eventually led to my own personal growth journey. This photo of me working from a hotel in Beijing above is a very different image than who I was earlier. I was in an on / off relation that had just ended for the third time. I was in a job I did not find fulfilling at all and I was drinking and partying way too much to make things worse. (Hint - this is the worst thing to do when you are already not happy). After that relationship ended again, something inside me snapped and I became set out to become the best person I could poss

Do the things you hate.  There is this fundamental rule that applies to human beings. People will always work harder to avoid pain than to gain pleasure. Human beings by default have a self preservation mode installed. We are stuck it with since the times when we were ape men and a fun Saturday night for us meant trying to find a higher cave so the saber tooth tiger wouldn't use us as tooth picks whenever he pleased. This worked great and it's mostly what allowed us to think critically and find solutions to our urgent problems back then. But since then, our conscious minds have developed and also

What are some confidence hacks?
(Note: I recently wrote a 5,000+ word guide to confidence on my website and I’ve used some of that content to answer your question here. Enjoy!) The first and most important confidence hack is to realize that you are not entitled to feeling confident. True self-confidence and skill-specific confidence are built and earned through months and years of practice and developing high levels of competence. It’s the result of deliberate practice, the conscious expansion of your comfort zone, and more failures than you probably want to accept.

As there are a lot of answers here, to try to come at this question from a completely different angle I will share a few thoughts about what working in financial markets has highlighted for me about confidence. Rather than quick hacks these are suggestions about ways to see and act in the world that provide a broad perspective, inner clarity and purpose of action. Confidence is often not only overrated but often dangerous. T There is a fine line between confidence and over confidence. I may be able to convince myself and others that the market will move in one direction or another but if reality 

Believe in yourself. I’m sure you’ve heard this a million times. This is because it’s so true that if you don’t begin by believing in your own abilities, there’s nothing you can accomplish or become.

Don’t be afraid to try even if you think you’ll fail if you try.Look people directly in the eyes without irritating them. This is a great confidence hack. Remember, if you don’t have self-confidence other people are feeling the same. Having self-confidence in the face of other p

As with most things in life, you can choose to either work hard or work smart.  If anyone ever tells you that you can’t ‘hack’ something, know that they are simply projecting their limiting beliefs onto you. Anything can be hacked - even confidence. Here’s how: 1. VISUALIZE YOURSELF ACTING CONFIDENTLY Our subconscious minds are extremely powerful. Through societal conditioning and learned beliefs, we navigate this highly complex experience that is called life. When you know this, you can leverage the power of the subconscious to move you further towards your goals. Therefore, if you want to be more c

*10 Ways To Increase Your Confidence In 10 Minutes #1. Get A GREAT Haircut If anything, hair affects your sense of self even more than clothes. It’s literally a part of you, and the style of your hair can completely change the look of your face. Research from Yale shows that bad hair dramatically affect self-esteem and social insecurity, make us see ourselves as having more character flaws—and cause men, even more than women, to feel less smart and less competent.  #2.

How do I develop a strong presence and personality?
“People may not remember exactly what you did, or what you said, but they will always remember how you made them feel.” Maya Angelou · You want to walk into a room and grab people’s attention? · You want heads to turn and conversations to open up in your presence? · Do you want to build up the people around you? · Do you want things to wind down when you leave your audiences (that is not a good wish to have – to be the only one who has an impact on others)? People who have strong presence and personality have a consistent manner of being. We see them performing their thing, as if they are in a show.

It may be dependent on if you’re a man or a woman. I see some men’s answers that would convey a very stoic personality. I’m not like that, but have a good presence and strong personality (to a fault, sometimes, I think). The prerequisites for a strong personality, for me anyhow as I’ve come to it organically, include some stubbornness or confidence borne out of absolutely nothing. It’s not like I’ve gotten positive feedback from the world consistently in my life. In fact, I’ve gotten some kinda shitty feedback.

How to Develop a Strong presence and Personality? The personality is the typical pattern of thinking, feeling, and behaviors that make a person unique. When we say that someone has a \” good personality\” we mean that they are likeable, interesting and pleasant to be with.  Everyone wants to be attractive to others. For that, a good personality is necessary - possibly even more than a good look. In fact, about 85 percent of your success and happiness will be the result of how you interact with others. Ultimately, it is your personality that determines whether people are attracted to you or shy away 

How do I get rid of this laziness and procrastination?
 Guess what: everybody experiences bouts of laziness and procrastination! Don’t believe people who tell you they’ve never been there (chances are they’re lying, and also nobody is perfect). That said, keep your eyes and ears open so that you can hear about shortcuts. Shortcuts are awesome: they’re usually simple, easy, and oh-my-god-why-haven’t-I-thought-of-this-myself QUICK ways to get through something that is challenging in some ways but important to you. Below are several shortcuts. Read through them and then experiment with them. Try one or try them all! See which ones can save you time and 

 Don’t overthink. Stop overthinking your problems, goals, plans, or end results; they will only keep you stuck in a vicious cycle of inertness or inactivity. Think whatever you have to contemplate about only for a brief time so that you won’t end up getting stuck in the middle.Ensure that you are well-nourished. Just like a car needs fuel to keep going, a human also needs fuel of their own which they get from nutritions. When your body lacks nutritions, your energy and concentration levels drop significantly, making it difficult for you to start and finish something.Promise yourself that you’ll

The simple answer would be: get up and take action! But I am sure, that is not the answer you hoped for. So let’s dissect it a bit. Procrastination, although a basic problem at first glance, can be a curse that prevents us from living the life of our dreams and becoming the person that we wish to become. Here are some of the “anti-procrastination” things that always help me and will help you, but only if you take them seriously. Set goals. Procrastination happens a lot when you don’t know where you are going, where you are heading. To heal this, set daily and weekly goals. That way, you actually 

There's a magic bullet in life to stop being and procrastinating. You might be ignoring it - even though I know of it, I go through phases where I refuse to use it. But if you're looking for the keys to the kingdom, they're right here. Exercise: every single day. If you're already about to close this tab and go back to "inspirational" pictures on Instagram to avoid actually taking any action, you're an idiot. If you're about to stop reading because you know this already, then I ask you: do you actually exercise EVERY SINGLE DAY? 99.9% of people don't. If you're in the 0.1% then congratulations,  

In order to find a solution to procrastination, we must understand why we procrastinate in the first place. I call it uppercutting your future self in the face.  Oddly enough, it's not the fear of failure that pushes us to procrastinate but the fear of achievement. Achievements scare us more than failing. And so we romanticize the idea of achieving great success, accumulating tons of skills and rocking it as badass kings and queens of our own rich and vast kingdoms of awesome. But before we even get started we are screwed up by our own subjectivity. We put up these blind spots around us, like so 

I used to be the laziest person in the world. And I used to be the worst procrastinator. During university I never finished an assignment before the due date. Sometimes I would stay up all night on the final night before the assignment was due playing computer games, and only start working on the assignment at 4am when it was due at 12pm that day. Some assignments I didn’t even bother starting. I just relied on the fact that I did well on exams in order to pass the subjects. I continuously told myself that I just have to get stronger; I should be able to sit down with the task at hand and force

Here's the thing -- there is NO SUCH THING as procrastination. Instead, what is true, is that there's a huge disconnect between your conscious mind/ego and your subconscious mind/truth, dream, and emotion center. Your conscious mind is capable of abstract thought, and most people believe it is where the "I" resides. Not even close. The conscious mind is capable of about 40-and-change calculations per second, the subconscious is capable of over a thousand times as many. It is far larger, smarter, more honest and more powerful than the puny ego. Having broad interests merely suggests that you are  

 Sometimes you are a procrastinator. Sometimes you are a lazy ass. And sometimes you may lack the motivation to do anything. Maybe because you are stressed about something or other. And it causing distractions to stay proactive. I procrastinate a lot when I am stressed. I find it irresistible to not procrastinate. And to tackle procrastination and stress, I try every day — Set realistic goals — the first step to tackle procrastination. When you know you are distracted. You are stressed and feeling lazy.

I have to say that I’m a little bit disappointed that majority of the answers don't differentiate between Laziness and procrastination. These are two completely different phenomenon. Firstly, procrastination is the act of ‘putting off’ a task until panic kicks in and you either; don't have a choice but to complete the task, orcome up with a reason for yourself as to why it’s not important. Laziness, however, is much more positive. “What? Mo! You’re losing the plot… Since when is laziness a good thing? DOWN-VOTE” Let me explain… … Laziness is an art form. The act of being lazy, is so valuable in all  

What are the best tricks to keep yourself motivated?
This is my list of keeping myself motivated; PsychologyIf your physiology is not good then it’s very hard to get motivated. There are lots of people saying “take cold showers!” or “wake up at 5 am!” or “eat healthy!” well, these actions are and can help you if your mind is at a healthy stage. But if you’re depressed, stressed out, feeling lonely, or whatever your problem is, you first have to find that problem and solve it. Everything starts mentally first. To feel good mentally, I suggest you to check your relationship with your family. Most importantly with your mom and dad. Are you good with  

Motivation is really important for everyone. Be it children, adults or people of old age. You must have heard this saying ‘where there is a will, there is always a way’. This clearly defines the term motivation. If there will not be any will or a desire obviously there will not any way to achieve it. Motivation provides us a roadmap to achieve everything that we aspire for as everyone in their journey of life is fighting their own battle they have their own dreams and aspirations.

I went from barely weighing 100 lbs to weighing ~175lbs with 7% body fat—a challenge that took me years to achieve (and if you’re curious, you can find my workouts here.). But if I look back before bodybuilding, the same habits that helped me change my physique were originally discovered playing Wo

My answer is also depend on few assumptions like one you have analytical mindset like think of a problem in term of models and constraints.

Losing your mojo is as easy and losing your car keys... You know you had them last night, but you just misplaced them right before crashing out. If you stop, think, and then retrace your steps you'll figure out where you left them. The same goes for your mojo, kinda... Here are 10 ideas to help you get your mojo back and keep yourself motivated: 1. Stop focusing on the past. You can't change it anyway. Overthinking will only perpetuate the downward spiral.

My personal hack… This one little mind trick has kept me motivated for years now and I kind of “stumbled” upon it when I read something about the brick kilns in India.

—Have a morning routine. 1.) The first thing I do in the morning is called priming. There are 4 components to it. The first is a warmup exercise where you move your arms up and down with breathing. Next, find 3 things you are grateful for. In addition, you pick a few of your accomplishments to focus on, then you think about the things you currently want to achieve and imagine them being DONE. The last component is called stacking, where you think of anything you are grateful for, you’ve accomplished, etc until there is a long list of things you have thought about, bring them into your heart and

I was very serious about my relationship. So the break-up left me so depressed and heart broken. I started hating myself, couldn't focus on anything. I loose all my confidence and started having weight loss and hair fall too. Malaysia is a beautiful place to explore and hangout but I didn’t wanted to go anywhere those times. I started blaming my looks because one thing was eating my mind that I look so ugly and no girl will ever give m 

Yes, Life is unfair. As i’m growing up, i’m realising day by day that life is unfair. I realise by the time that some lives are more expensive than others, some kids are born in horrible conditions, and they are destined to live a mesirable life, others are born in palaces, get anything they want, and can choose to become anything amazing in this world. Sure, many people overvome poverty and horrible conditions of living to be successful, yeah maybe in America, where people have more advantages, and where the country recognize talents, but what about the rest of the world, in Africa, South Asia  

YES , it definitely is. Let compare some interesting facts, which are infact an everyday reality. Have you seen poor little kids and ever wondered that: 1. I have a roof to stay and they don't. 2. I can easily afford three times food a day and they can't. 3. I can buy new clothes occasionally but they can't. 4. I can travel in trains but for them, it is a luxury. 5. I can afford good internet connectivity and a smartphone but they can't. {So life is unfair for sure but not to US because we're using smartphones at least for sure.

When the farmer was about to die, he had nothing to give to his sons but a few potatoes. So he decided to distribute those potatoes on the age basis. A, being oldest, received maximum number of potatoes. Likewise, C got the least and B, somewhere in between. After receiving potatoes, A was too happy and he started eating those potatoes lavishly. B, on the other hand, was not pleased. He kept complaining about the distribution, and was so furious over it t

According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, unfair is defined as - 'marked by injustice, partiality, or deception.’ So is life unfair? In other words, is it marked by injustice, partiality or deception? Notice that these three words, or even the word 'unfair' itself, requires that the judgement has to be made by an objective viewer. If I say life is unfair, that is just my viewpoint. If someone else says life is fair, that is also her viewpoint. It is subjective. We mostly experience both sides of unfairness in life.

I guess an explanation is in order. In 2003 she and I, along with a good friend, took a leap of faith and started a business, a small hobby shop. None of us were going to get rich, but it would, we hoped, provide a living for us.

Quite a few people inspire me. Quiet a few people changed the world we live. “Never give up.” It’s probably one of the most cliché phrases you’ll hear as you’re building your career. But there’s a reason these sayings are clichés you never know when success really does lie around the next corner like all the successful people found out. All these folks are now household names, but they didn’t become one easily. Some lived in their car, others suffered family abuse, and almost all encountered rejection after rejection professionally and personally before finally landing a foot in the door. Read o

Undoubtedly these are the people to learn something from. These are the people who have risen against all odds thrust upon them by the society (prejudice, stereotypes, casteism, racism &amp; what not) But I've seen that such kind of motivation doesn't last long.

What's your number one motivation for going to work every day besides a paycheck?
I’m 55 years old. I’m unmarried and have no kids. Short of a lottery jackpot win, I’m unlikely to ever get married. I can’t get what I want and don’t want what I can get. I started at Walmart 9 1/2 years ago. At that time, I was 300 pounds, broke, bankrupt, and living in my brother’s basement. I was also a video game addict. Reality speaking, what did I have to live for? I would joke,” I’m fat, live in my brother’s basement and work for Walmart. Somebody please just shoot me.” Seven years ago I got totally disillusioned with gaming and quit cold turkey. After quickly becoming bored, I decided to  

Since my very first job, I always had this strong feeling that, If I spent my whole paycheck in the lapse of the 30 days before the next one, I would have just wasted one month of my life. This concept has stuck with me since the beginning. So, I made a deal with myself that 10% to 20% must be saved every month. And that has been a great piece of motivation. So, I would get my paycheck, and the very first thing was to save 10%. That would go to a sepparate bank account. That small investment would go to TIPS (inflation bonds) and REITs and Stocks. And as they grew, two small condos to put for rent

I honestly don't know if I'm all that passionate about a particular activity or hobby, but I am deeply passionate about being successful. There are lots of different definitions of success out there. For me, it's personal and financial freedom. I could begin to pontificate about how I come from a disadvantaged background and how my family's difficulties with money inspired me to dream big and work hard, but I've learned that's not all that unique. By saying this I certainly don't mean to belittle the challenges of esc

I “go to work” daily — although I work from home and don’t need to travel more than a few feet to get there. I love what I do, regardless of how much or little I receive in compensation for it. Not that I don’t relish getting paid or negotiate the best fee for my work, because I definitely want and do both. When you love what you do, you’re motivated by the self-satisfaction you receive from the work, the opportunities to continue to get better, moments when you’re acknowledged by others, and how fast the day seems to go when you’re creatively engaged.

I'm 34 and have an awesome job as a phone based financial advisor for already established accounts. I get to help people in a bad spot use and maximize their savings the most effeciently. I really enjoy talking about available investments and the way that they effect life and life goals. Most importantly to me, I worked retail out of college for years, working my way up to a manager. I hated it, I was good at it but it was mind-numbingly boring. I started in 2008 and life as a retail worker just got worse and worse over the years with higher sales expected with a reduced workforce. As a manager 

My number 1 motivation is helping people see themselves differently. When a client tells me that, for the first time, they feel truly confident about their contributions and thus like themselves better, and are happier…that is like chocolate to me! There is nothing like feeling you truly made a difference in someone else’s experience to give them a better quality of life…nothing feels better than that to me. And when employees or spouses thank me for the positive changes they experience in their relationship with a leader I’ve coached, it’s a bonus I get really excited about. 453 viewsEric Krausz, Computer Programmer (1987-present)Answered 1 year ago · Author has 3.4K answers and 1M answer views

Your number one motivation for working should be the desire to contribute to others, to make yourself valuable. Become an information hub. Be an expert in systems and procedures where you work. Develop your skills as much as possible. Inspire your co-workers. Be grateful that someone is paying you for your time. Show that gratitude by putting forth your best effort. Most of your waking hours are spent working. Be mindful. Work is the way you help make the world a better place. 921 views · View upvotes9Bill Carson, ScientificAnswered 1 year ago · Author has 1.9K answers and 385.1K answer views

Why do we need to study?
 You were BORN to study… along with all of nature, each species, all of consciousness. A current problem with our culture and most educational systems is the coercion towards the subject of “studying.” Please consider: To study is to look at closely in order to observe, to learn. Every animal has an instrument used to compute and synthesize incoming information from their environment. All alive does, too. Amoeba, plants, insects, cats, squirrels… each are in the process of taking in data, recognizing patterns, synthesizing options, making decisions, reacting according to their best understanding. Th 

We should need to study otherwise we will become like potatoes and all other species will surpass us. How ever this most likely won’t be a problem for a while because it is human nature to want to know things and studying is the devotion of time and attention to gaining knowledge of an academic subject and almost everything there is to know can fall into an academic subject. From a governmental or economistic point of view we should need to study because that is how we can become most productive. It is true that people without education can be economically active (contribute financially towards 

Life expectancy in current world is around 65+. We start studying at the age of 4+ to learn about how to deal with the life after that. Maths :- If you are poor at it , only god knows about your survival tactics. Language:- Every communication in the entire world is depend on a language . If you know one then only you get ready to grasp other beautiful subjects and theories of life. When you mix with the culture and tradition of other people this is the only tool that helps you to survive. Studying it certainly helps you to understand reading , writing and understanding skills.

Just ask yourself once before reading this article. Why do you study? Some will say for better living, some will for parents but most of you don't have an answer. Why? Why you don’t have an answer? You should know the answer without even thinking. The answer is very simple, its "YOU". Yes, You. You study for YOURSELF for YOUR own HAPPINESS, not for your parents or better living (a by-product of your happiness). It’s Just you We are happy when we do what we enjoy, what we like, what we love and by studying we get to work where we can enjoy, where we love, everyone has an area of interest, so educat 

We study so that we can learn about ourselves and others, and the world around us. We could learn without studying and going to school, but if we did that, we would waste a lot of time rediscovering knowledge that is already known and written down in books or available on Wikipedia or Google. This holds true whether we are living in the woods or working in Silicone Valley. Let's say you grew up in the city and one day, you decided that you want to "live off the Grid" entirely on your own, away from society. So you take the bus as far north as it goes in Alaska, and hitch hike for a while and fi 

If your question is on ‘why we need to study/to get knowledge?’ then, We study to make our life better. lets take three basic needs food, cloth and shelter. when we were babies, we don’t know anything. That time even our food preference is based on others knowledge. later on we see a lot of foods, experience and in some cases we refer theories and others experience on foods. By studying/get knowledge on this we choose our food priorities. It applies for everything. when we come to current economy where we have to work to earn money. we need knowledge on how efficiently we work. similarly this co 

To study: to gain knowledge, to look at in detail  Studying is essential for the survival of the human race. Studying helps individuals and society evolve and develop. “If you always do what you've always done you will always get what you always got” quote from Henry Ford . Studying is gaining knowledge or learning, either from previous experience (our own or other peoples') or to experimentally research for ourselves. As children we learn the basics of life - how to keep alive, to thrive, to socialise, and to cooperate; with the long term aim to live independently and interdependently. Originally w 

About 4,000 years ago, someone accidentally first combined tin with copper, producing bronze for the first time. Bronze was the most revolutionary invention of the time. It quickly became the key advantage in warfare. With bronze, the Egyptian Pharaoh was unbeatable.  Let’s go back in history to answer your question: Why is studying so important in life?  The only way to stop the Egyptian Army was with another Bronze equipped army. As other armies armed themselves with bronze weapons, the high demand of tin and copper brought scarcity of the elements.

I take it you refer to studying at a university. If that’s not the case, please clarify. For me personally, I’d differentiate four reasons: To learn. I enjoy learning things and gaining knowledge. The motivation behind that might be called mastery. Also, in university you are allowed to put knowledge into action without much risk involved - you are able to try things and learn from your mistakes while consequences are minimal. This is far more effective than just reading books.To understand. Studying does not just transfer knowledge, it also teaches you how to think. I learned specific problem s

There are two kind of mindsets in this world. The fixed mindset - your qualities are fixed.The growth mindset - your qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts.

How do I motivate myself to study?
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.  1.Try to understand your studying style better What will make it easier for you to work? We are all prone to pleasant experiences, and, naturally, we tend to avoid uncomfortable, dry chores and duties. So try to make your study experience as interesting as possible. 2. Don't question your abilities Don't put yourself down by comparing yourself to others. 3. Be clear about why you want to get good grades One of the best ways to get motivated to study is to be very clear about why you want to get good grades in the first place. Make a list 

MOTIVATION IS A MYTH. Image source- Google[1] While we being unproductive and wasting our time, we think that what’s being missing is motivation, which gives the SPARK to work.But what if we misunderstood the idea of motivation. What if we could re frame the idea and structure our lives in a way where we never need to worry about motivation ever. Jeff Haden in his book THE MOTIVATION MYTH says that motivation is something which we can create ourselves.So lets see why motivation is not the spark. This is the ultimate motivation myth- the idea, that we need some spark to get some work done, and we w

If you want motivation then you’ll have to refill that bucket every day. Find an inspiring quote, watch motivational clips on YouTube, get a motivational coach, etc. However, if you want consistency then I’d advise you to create a system that allows you to do more studying and less of whatever is getting in the way. The most common thing standing in the way is the illusion that we should “feel like it”. Except when it’s something you’re really into, when the hell does one actually “feel like” studying? So, “feeling like it” shouldn’t be part of the equation. What do we do? First we get rid of all

Motivating oneself to sit down and study is a difficult task. Let alone if it is a subject you do not enjoy or are struggling with at the moment.

A different career? You want to make a better life for your family?.etc.. Remind your self of this WHY. Next chunk it down.

You can’t often get motivation out of nowhere, but you can build momentum from nothing. You just have to play a small trick on yourself to get rolling. Motivation, as most people define it, is hard to get, fleeting, and overrated. Actually, in some ways it’s actually detrimental to productivity. The reason that motivational crap is so popular is that it’s an emotional rush that makes you FEEL like you’ve gotten something done, without actually doing anything. So, screw motivation.

Dear Friend, Let us first understand what exactly is motivation. May be then you can go to your school freely:) What is motivation? All motivation is external. Go into this. Motivation means an external force, an external agency, an external stimulus, is acting upon you and making you react in a certain way. Is that not what motivation is? So, someone comes and says a few words to you, those words have a certain impact on your mind and you start acting and behaving in a particular way. That is what you call as motivation. Or you watch an inspiring movie or read a fancy tale and that has a certa 

First off, studying for long periods of time is a hard task for anyone. Don’t beat yourself up for not being able to do it. Doing so isn’t going to do you any help. All that it will do is put you in a bad mood. Guess what the biggest deterrent to putting in work is? Yup, you guessed it, it’s being perpetually in a bad mood. So, if you’re being too hard on yourself now is as good a time as any to stop. Now that you hopefully realize that it is all but normal to have trouble studying for long hours let’s look at how you can go about doing it.  Write down your goals.

But I needed something specific. I wanted to hire a growth hacker to work on a campaign we had coming up. I was looking for someone young and new to the scene – someone who wanted to prove themselves. Someone hungry. If I found the right person, I was ready to bring them in for a lon

People these days (including myself) seem to need constant validation by others to function in society. Some subtly provide themselves with this need, and some obtain their validation in the most annoying and bothersome ways possible. One prime example, snapchat.

These are the captions you usually find on those photos. “Oh my god, I’m so ugly”“Ew, look at [Insert small and unimportant body flaw here] on my [Insert random body par

Self-esteem is the way you feel about yourself. It is an important aspect of your emotional well-being. Knowing your self-esteem is the first step to any kind of progress and happiness in life.

That means, the process of boosting your self-esteem starts with deciding that you are valuable and treating yourself as such.

Lots of great answers. I'd like to share neat little trick I've learned... Act self-confident. To act self-assured. No one will know that deep down, you may think you're an insecure loser. Which you aren't, of course, but we humans are capable of telling ourselves the most deranged lies.  No one needs to know you feel insecure; no one will know.

After all, you have to practice it to attain it; no one is born completely confident in themselves.  Some specific tips on how to

Since my last few posts I’ve been getting messages regarding confidence, self-esteem and how I appear to be so confident. First, let me start of by saying that confidence is not something you are magically ‘born’ with for most people, including myself. I like to visualize confidence as a muscle that you can grow and grow, as you train it. Even if you are shy and have low self-esteem right now, you can ABSOLUTELY change that if you want to.

Self-confidence refers to how you feel about your abilities with respect to a given activity. As such, confidence is bound to vary from situation to situation. Self-esteem refers to how you feel about yourself on the whole. In other words, how much self-regard or self-love you have, how comfortable you are with who you are who you are becoming. A person could have high confidence but low self-esteem, or vice versa. For instance, someone is an exceptional singer. Ask them to sing before a crowd and they will leave the audience spell-bound. Yet, they might walk off the stage thinking that this is a 

What are some tips for boosting self esteem?
I used to be extremely uncomfortable with how I looked like, I would pick the most average, dark and covering clothes I could find because I was afraid of trying styles that at the time I couldn't see on myself because of how “not me” it would look like. Eventually I started realizing that probably most people have gone and go through this feeling of not liking the way they look, and this feeling of inadequacy when trying new things. I'm sure if you ask people around you about something they don't like about themselves, they will have something to name (if they feel comfortable enough). With th 

Many are confusing SELF CONFIDENCE with SELF-ESTEEM. Self-esteem is how we value ourselves while self-confidence is how we carry overselves; confidence in ourselves and in what we do. Example: Same clothes, different people; who wears it better? What matter most is, how we carry ourselves or wear our clothes. WITHOUT self-esteem, we cannot have self-confidence. We can easily see someone who doesn't have self-esteem because it reflect in their posture, body language, and especially eye contact (communication skills).

Start with a cleanse. Throw out the story of your life if you are not a hero in it. Buy a beautiful, brand new notebook. On the very first crisp, clean, blank page, write out your story.

For much of my adult life, I was a seeker of these things. How can I be more motivated?How can I be more confident?How can I feel good about myself? I sought and sought and sought. I read books, attended seminars, applied techniques, and worked on myself. I analyzed, strategized and tried to hold myself accountable. Then one day it hit me: I was more miserable than ever. Rather than being filled with confidence, motivation, and self esteem as a result of my efforts, I faced with the undeniable fact that my life had turned into a constant struggle. This lead me to realize something: The harder I soug 

How do you get your self-esteem back after it has been knocked down? The subject of esteem is among the most highly prized. If it is not, it ought to be. The role that this feature plays in our lives is so crucial that it actually determines what people will think, feel, do and not do. Read the question again. There are two parts to the inquest: a) How Do You Get Your Self-Esteem Back b) After It Has Been Knocked Down I have treated the subject of esteem in different contexts with the principle remaining pretty much the same. The unfortunate truth is that the idea of esteem is actually grossly misu 

You change your mindset about how YOU see yourself. Self-esteem comes from the value we place on ourselves, and often that value is pretty low or non-existent because we were not given much reinforcement in childhood, perhaps, or shown much appreciation for our efforts. You were probably criticised a lot which has enabled you to develop a negative sense of self-worth. If you have not been appreciated by partners, those who matter, or in your job, that low self esteem would only have gotten worse over time so that you find it difficult to feel good about yourself. For your information, self-este 

Great question Riley, thanks for taking the time to voice it. Poor self esteem generally occurs when we focus on the wrong thing or we’re subject to an environment thats counterproductive to a positive sense of our own self value. Call someone an idiot for long enough and what amounts to a negative verbal assault begins to rewire their internal ideology and erode their self confidence. The truth is, words carry power they aren't empty vessels. We can use them to build up others or inevitably tear them down. Positive verbal affirmation isn't akin to madness.

The day, when a 29-Israeli assault team raided into the unknown,the heart of Africa, from the death-flashing sky to do the impossible, to free the hostages from the Palestinian terrorists stationed in Uganda with the entire airforce and army of Uganda supporting the Palestinian terrorists. In Bollywood movie Zameen, there is a dialogue where Ajay Devgan, to deal with, hostage crisis speaks' You give me just a few soldiers, and then we'll do what Israelis did in Entebbe’. The only difference is it was fiction but Entebbe was real. 1 . In 1976, an Air France flight bound from Israel to Paris is bo 

Not so long ago, I heard a story about a mathemagician who is thought to be the best by many, and even maybe the best of all time. Like Harry Potter, he was predicted to be the chosen one, and he started as a sorcerer’s apprentice, under the most famous and influential mystic of that time. Dear reader, this answer will be slightly longer than what we are used to. Bear with me. You won’t regret. The name of that senior mathematician was Alexander Grothendieck.[1] It is not my intention to say much about Grothendieck, because so much is written about him already. He came from an anarchistic family ( 

This is Mia khalifa She is a former pornstar which itself needs very guts . Yeah , you read it right ‘Making porn needs confidence’ and she has it all . Now the reason i feel so is when she started making porn and Pornhub revealed that she was the No. 1 ranked performer on their website. She received online death threats , including a manipulated image of an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant executioner preparing to behead her, and a message warning her that she would go to Hell, to which she replied "I've been meaning to get a little tan recently". Though she left the industry after 1 year a 

Confidence level :  [Source =”Google Image Results/2010/02/smiling-obama”] Well this is not exactly the answer for “height of confidence but i will tell you guys how my confidence (i must say calmness and self esteem saved my life) So, today was my Board exam of social studies and i did not even touch my NCERT books. Well hey wait guys stop dont judge me, read the answer i am sure you will find it worth it.

Can you guess this movie?  PS: Google . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Benedict Cumberbatch leads as the hero. The height of confidence of Alan Turing is immense.Intially,everyone looked at him and started to laugh when he shared the idea to build a machine that crack German codes.He took it as a challenge and atlast the machine successfully compiled to crac 

Let me tell you a story. When I was in 2nd year of my college, I was very much studious (which I still am :p) and I would read a particular topic from multiple sources so that I could get the complete essence of it. This increased my knowledge tremendously. But that actually turned out to be a curse for me as I would sometimes argue with the professor of a particular subject on a specific point of a topic that he was telling wrong. But as all India professors are, arrogant and stubborn, my professors also were not different at all. They would just get angry and shut me up. Many of them even chal 

Height of Confidence, or height of madness? You decide.  Let me tell you about Juan Pujol García, a Spanish man. In 1940, he thought to do something good for humanity and wanted to join Britain against Spanish dictator Francisco Franco who was not supporting Britain. Juan approached the British three different times showing interest to join them as spy. He was rejected all three times. He could get disheartened but he was Juan, he cannot give up. He planned to be a German spy and then approach British to be a double agent. He kept his personal choices away and created his identity as Pro Nazi Span 

Well this small story may not sound so confident but still it has that element of boost which is sufficient enough to make you say 'wow'. It is the way it is. Small things do matter in life. Everyday we see different events of life happening around, yes I call it events of life. Now it's up to an individual to see it with open eyes and open mind. It's up to us to get the right out of it. The right which you feel could help you sometime. This guy is a friend from work. He is very clear with his thoughts. These days he has started trading. He buys Options and keep an eye on it and sell it when he

Making self-deprecating comments without it being ironic on a regular basis. There’s some people who are legitimately insecure. You can tell, by their comments and their overall attitude. With that kind of people, I don’t mind at all trying to help the, lift their self-esteem, especially when I do see something positive about them that they genuinely don’t realize. However, there’s another kind of person, who may appear insecure on the surface but, when you pay attention, you can tell they’re just looking for attention.

Now that I have it you might as well know the different kinds of behaviors that indicate that the person is calling for attention from others. There is not just one thing but many things that scream that someone is clearly looking for attention. These behaviors are displayed both on social media and in real life. So by the end of this answer, you should have learned to spot those behaviors and other related behaviors. So let us go ahead.

 How do you spot someone looking for attention? Watch how they listen. I was at a networking event for founders and growth hackers in LA. The guest list was a who’s who – some of the biggest names in Silicon Beach, but also a fair amount of upstarts and rising stars. Most people attended purely to make new connections. But I needed something specific. I wanted to hire a growth hacker to work on a campaign we had coming up. I was looking for someone young and new to the scene – someone who wanted to prove themselves. Someone hungry. If I found the right person, I was ready to bring them in for a lon 

A girl looking like this Posting a selfie and saying “Oh my God, I look so ugly today.” 2. There is this guy I know, a friend of friend, who helped someone for the first time in his life and made a video of it and posted it on Instagram the next minute. 3. A girl I used to know would take one shot of vodka and then would act like she's drunk, just so she could act all “obviously sexy”, and everyone would be like “oh, she's just drunk”. 4.

I was asked to make this answer after I commented on another's answer about a picked on girl who went through a very serious transformation after being bullied. My comment on the answer in question has 130 up votes, from me explaining how similar my situation was also at that age. So here is the answer I was asked to give, based on my comment. What screams “I want attention”? Transforming yourself to such an extent that even your closest friends and family fear for you. When I was in school, elementary, middle, and high, I was bullied. Constantly. My weight. My looks. My style. My personality… N 

People these days (including myself) seem to need constant validation by others to function in society. Some subtly provide themselves with this need, and some obtain their validation in the most annoying and bothersome ways possible. One prime example, snapchat. Certain people constantly are posting pictures of themselves on their story, sending them privately to other people, etc. This may seem normal, but wait, there’s a catch. These are the captions you usually find on those photos. “Oh my god, I’m so ugly”“Ew, look at [Insert small and unimportant body flaw here] on my [Insert random body par

Lying about having illnesses or being bullied. I used to have this friend. I was 12 when I became friends with her. Let's call her Kate. For the first year of being friends with her, she seemed like a genuinely good person. Then she started using this somewhat unknown social media site since her mum had banned her from social media and it was easier for her to hide that she was using this site. She started talking to people and most of them claimed to be suicidal and have various mental disorders. One of them (who she was dating) even faked their suicide just to upset her. By the way, I know it  

My 17-year old daughter is extremely obese - to the point that her doctor is concerned about her health. However, she has low self-esteem, so we don't want to hurt her. How should we approach weight loss in a delicate manner?
Hello. There are some things you can be delicate with, and other things you will need to really confront. It may take you into some uncomfortable places, but if you want to address the issue, be prepared. I’m writing you a pretty full answer below - but the most necessary item is always to act with love. I’ve worked with many people on weight loss issues, and one of the things we tend to reject is that in order to successfully lose weight, we need to have the right mindset. Your daughter is 17, and obese, and has low self-esteem. I suspect she is dealing with more issues than you are aware of.  

There is no way to do this in a delicate manner. No matter how gentle or kind you think you are being, the message will be clear: her body is a problem that needs to be fixed. However, the bigger issue here is that you are getting bad medical advice. This is unsurprising, as most doctors insist on “prescribing” weight loss as a medical treatment for fat patients despite overwhelming evidence that this is not only not helpful, but often harmful. While most people can lose some weight short term, virtually no one keeps it off long term. This is true even when patients undergo weight loss surgery - 

Congratulations on being a caring parent and not lowering the poor girl’s self esteem to be any lower than it is now. She KNOWS she is obese and has probably been teased about it already at school, or even bullied. That makes it harder for her to do subjects like PE, and probably makes her eat even more food as a comfort mechanism. The last thing she needs is for anyone to start making A Big Thing of it. She needs your support and sympathy, not criticism and ridicule and I’m very pleased to see that you understand this - there are a lot of similar questions on here that take the opposite view,  

Say nothing first. In my opinion, if it was my daughter, I would use up all the groceries in the house until there is almost nothing left. Next, I would go shopping alone (for just this time) and buy only healthy foods. WAIT, I would select a few snacks, like 3, and they would be healthy tasty snacks. The rest of the cart is all healthy single ingredient foods. I would get all the groceries home, and hopefully she is there. Everyone helps put groceries away in my house. If she didn't bring it up about all the food being healthy, I would say: Hey love, I want to thank you. When we were at your doct 

As someone who has a hard time losing weight, I'm going to tell you some things that you won't like to hear, especially considering how much you want to help her. First, don't focus on weightloss. Make the goal about improving health, and let the little bits of weightloss become a perk. Second, take her to see a psychologist as well as a dietitian. A dietitian can teach her about eating better, but she likely has some psychological issues with food that need to be addressed simultaneously. Third, don't be too restrictive, because that's going to make things harder. Also, don't make her feel bad i 

Qualifiers: I have been overweight since childhood. I have been morbidly obese for the last 20–30 years. Later in life, my mother spoke to me about how concerned she was, and the choices she made in my childhood about how/when to address it. She said, “I knew something was wrong. I didn’t know how to fix it.” I said, “Nothing you did could have fixed it. That had to come from inside me.” For me, in my journey of physical self-hate, self-esteem has been the issue around which all other things have always revolved. You can’t motivate someone to do what is necessary to lose weight if they don’t care 

Few things you may want to consider since weight gain is a symptom.. She is likely self-medicating. Is she under chronic stress? e.g. from bullying in school? Does she have to walk on eggshells at home to protect herself from psychologically abusive outbursts of a family member? Is there someone at home who is passive-aggressively tormenting her about her weight?What habits lead to her being obese? Find ways to replace small food habits with non-food rewards.If she eats while watching tv, try having her do something else to occupy her hands.. e.g. knitting.. I know, it sounds grandma-like but i

This saddens me. What I think you have to do is this your daughter I am certain k n o w s that she is overweight. I cannot believe that she wants to be overweight. Losing weight especially if you don't know how to is not easy it can be very very difficult. What you should do is give her a hug and a kiss and tell her what the doctor said and then tell her that you love her very much and that you don't want to hurt her feelings. But that you are concerned for her and her well being. And that you would like to help her to learn how to manage her weight. And the first step his to talk to a doctor  

When I was fat, I hated it when people commented on my weight, worse was when they told me I need to lose weight often at family or other such gatherings. Now, it wasn't the worse because they said something wrong, it was because as someone who had been obese her whole life, all it did was make me self conscious. Everytime there was a social event, my first thought was dread at hearing those words again. It did not matter if you looked good that day, your achievements did not matter, or if you were even down or upset about something. It doesn't help to be told over and over again that you need t 

I would not frame the issue as weight loss. I would go for improved health. The first thing I would do is check out her intestinal flora. No, I am not a crunchy granola vegan Californian. I’m an evidence-committed University lecturer. However, the intestinal flora of normal weight people differs significantly from that of the obese, and includes differences in bacterial species, including versions you cannot get in standard probiotics. You can ask your doctor. Some of these are available by prescription. If you are into DYI, you can try a fecal transplant, that is, your daughter uses a laxative

Why do I feel like a failure? How can I stop feeling this way?
Hard to write a better answer than James Altucher, but I'd like to add something to this discourse: First question: Why do I feel like a failure?  I don't know for sure, but I'd bet it has to do with a stupid ideal that you unconsciously accepted from someone and began judging yourself in comparison to that. Two problems, two fixes: 1) Stop comparing yourself. There is a great book that uses humour to illustrate exactly why this is a bad idea: How to Make Yourself Miserable: Dan Greenburg 2) Stop having idealisms and start following the very practical advice of people like  James Altucher. Also,  

I'm currently experiencing the same feeling, however I have come to realization that it is simply an illusion created by pessimism or something of negative nature. I'm 17 years old, and for a long time, and even still occasionally, I fall into the trap of thinking I am not capable, like the average person, of correctly completing a task. Why do I think I fail so much? Because you can point out the failures in your life unproprtionally to your successful accomplishments. It is a pessimistic habit, a bais torward negative experience that has been created in which you acknowledge and only remeber  

Don't ever lose hope. Patience is the only light you have when are around with deep drakness of failures. Learn from your failure and bad experiences and bounce back. Don't feel down that i can't make it. 1. First, don't lose hope and Just accept how you feel. When you’ve failed it will most likely hurt. Sometimes a bit. Sometimes a lot.But don't lose hope that is the very precious thing with you in time of failure. Don’t try to push it away by distracting yourself or by trying to push the responsibility onto the rest of the world.And don’t try to paint it over with a smile.Just accept it take al 

I'm 30 years old and I haven't achieved anything remarkable in my life. I'm a totally ordinary guy. I don't even have a place of my own.   I haven't had one for the past six years. I've lived in many different places spread across three continents. I sort of feel like a nomad. When I'm in my hometown in Munich I sleep at my mom's house. If I'm not, I usually stay at hostels or AirBnBs all over the world. I never bought any furniture in my life. At the same time a lot of the people around me start getting married and think about raising a family, whereas I can't even properly take care of my own shi 

Ok. Ten Ways to Stop Feeling Like a Failure   ​  Let's make one thing clear: failure is not good. People try to say, "all great successes start with failure".  This is not true. Nor is true that Thomas Edison failed 10,000 times before he invented a lightbulb.  Don't let people indoctrinate you into the faddish cult of failure. It's depressing and makes you feel like you can't get out of bed and nothing is worth it and nothing will ever work again.  Also, failure can kill you. When Phillipe Petit walked on a tight wire between the two buildings of the World Trade Center, he couldn't afford to fail. You 

 Feeling like a failure comes from not accomplishing your goals and giving up on yourself. I’ve failed many times in life but have learned that this can never stop me for reaching my full potential. There’s “bad” habits that you’ve picked up subconsciously overtime. This has caused you to have negative emotions such as failure, anger, resent, guilt, or sadness. We will avoid this pain even if that means giving up on our own dreams. Believing that these emotions are all you can experience can be stressful and negatively impacting to your personal growth. Here are 3 principles that’ll help you accomp 

Feel this story okay and you may find your answer :) “He was sitting near a tea stall sipping a cup of tea with a cigarette in his hand, wondering about his career, his goals, lost love life. In his mind, he was a loser, a complete failure in life. His many friends got placed in big MNCs and he was still there sipping a cup of tea and making calculation in his mind to save few more bucks so that he can afford meals for few more days as the end of the month is near and he left with few notes of hundred only.

I think failing and feeling like a failure are two very different things. I'm going to respectfully disagree with anyone that suggests failure isn't good.  What makes failure good is the learning and growing experience.  Sure, there are other learning modes that have different characteristics but that doesn't invalidate learning from mistakes. Failure can be a symptom of setting high expectations of yourself.  These high expectations are frequently accompanied by high risks.  It takes real character not to lower your personal expectations and to continue pick yourself up and try again.  Ask your 

2011. I was in Madras, jobless, counting the number of Royal Enfield motorcycles and flights. I stayed close to the airport and so whenever I could hear an aircraft closing in, I would run to the terrace to watch it in close quarters. I always marveled at the magnificent engineering involved in the design of aircraft. How would it be to fly to a different country, miles away! I wondered. I envied the fliers. How great would it be to say “I am working abroad” or “I have a flight to New York tonight,” I envisaged. Since I did not have a job, I helped two guys in the neighborhood with their English  

Stop being one. Concepts, and ideas, and tricks, and ra-ra-ra will take you a ways. At some point you might want more.Here it is. You can have what you want. You want satisfaction, and success. You want changes with positive outcomes. Even when it is not obvious, change is always happening. Good decisions can turn that change toward the life you want.  Changes that are based solely on information, fade. If the psychological component of decisions is not taken into account.. That creates more disappointments.  Daniel Kahneman answered a question on this topic with, "most reactions are a 

What causes low self-esteem?
What are useful social skills that can be picked up quickly?
There are multiple social skills that can be picked up in relatively short amount of time, however, I would inspire readers to spend active efforts on this and learn from experiences as you go. In about 100 hours of efforts, you can make a significant improvements. First, I would talk about how you can work on your body language, and make a positive impact. ONE: Body fitness: This is seriously important, and with due respect to somewhat overweight people, I have to tell you that body fitness improves confidence tremendously, improves the skin glow, improves the heart rate, posture and overall lo

Here is 3 simple tips you can implement right away to improve you social skills: 1. Stop Just Smiling and Nodding - You know when you miss something the other person says because you're thinking, instead of fully paying attention. It's totally normal... everyone does it from time to time. It's actually not your wandering mind that disconnects you from a conversation. It's HOW you manage the situation WHEN your mind inevitably wanders. Maybe you smile and nod because the other person is smiling... but then you miss the next thing they say AS WELL, because you're busy wondering if they noticed that  

Eye contact. It is an idiotically simple thing, but it remains one of the most impactful life hacks around.   There are many great answers to this question, but the one that can be picked up in literally five seconds, requires no practice or special skill, and which will serve you the rest of  your life is simply a commitment to eye contact.   No matter what anyone ever tells you, the most attractive quality in a person is confidence.  But "be confident" is not very good advice.  Instead, find the best proxy for confidence, in terms of interactive behavior.  And that's eye contact.    Start this r 

Here are my 10 ideas (and #10 is my favorite): 1. Look people in the eyes. 2. Smile. 3. Ask questions. But don't kill another person with them as if inspector is investigating on them. Rather, show genuine interest for other person's life and experiences. 4. Don't talk too much. When someone tells a story, stop your urge to follow up with an example from your own life. Rather say: "Wow, that's cool!" 5. When you introduce someone, make him or her a superstar. "This is my friend Tom. I met him at my first workplace and he saved my ass when I had my first project deadline! I cannot imagine what would 

 Stare at the spaces between the eyes- most people are not comfortable maintaining eye contact and this is the perfect substitute. Just stare at the spaces between the eyes and the person will think you're maintaining eye contact.Come early- this is my number one trick. If you want instant popularity at any event, all you have to do is come early. When you come early, you get to talk with the participants as they come. You can get to know as many 10-15 people before the event starts and this will give the false impression that you know everyone.Wave at empty spaces- I learnt this from Leil Lown

Never just say ‘good when someone asks ‘how’s it going?’ - Instead of justing using a default response, have a set of little quips or pithy phrases you can use when someone asks you this common question. I usually say something like, “Any day above ground is a good one.” This seems trivial, but getting in the habit of having ‘little sayings’ instead of common responses helps you stand out from the crowd. It also teaches you to think on your feet more during other conversations and you’ll have more interesting responses to common questions like “What do you do for a living?” Developing the abil

I have a developed few of my own personal practices after a lifetime of lonely awkwardness. I have no illusions that I’m the first one to think of these. But enjoy!! I have nothing against foul language, and I use it often! But if you're in an argument, cursing a lot either means that you lack the vocabulary to truly insult somebody, or that you lack the restraint to effectively argue your point. So build your vocabulary.Like #1, most people who get into fist fights aren't smart enough to talk their way out of trouble (I learned this from Roger Ebert).Use more adjectives. If somebody asks “how 

If someone is fishing for compliments – take the bait. When someone is fishing for compliments they don’t want to hear the truth. They just want validation. It’s not about the words. It’s about making a friend feel good. This is how you do it: Friend: “I got 400 Likes on my new profile picture.”You: “That’s sick! I’ve seen it, you look amazing in it.” Another example: Friend: “I am so tired from all that working out.”You: “But it pays off. I wish I had abs like you have.” I know, you feel the urge to respond “I am sick and tired of you talking about your damn workout. Now shut the f*ck up!” But re 

 Look at the most interesting, social beings you know.  Think about what you like about them. You'll see a couple main traits YOU can emulate : Tell Crazy Good Stories The best social butterflies have a bunch of stories up their sleeve.  Humans remember experiences, meaning they remember stories.  When you get together with your buddies from high school, all you talk about is "Remember this, remember that." When you meet someone new, you want to hit on this same point. For social butterflies, you'll notice a couple things about these people as you hang out with them more. ..They usually have only a 

Stop focusing on your inner dialogue - When I was in my early twenties, I would often be worried about what I would say next…even as the person was still talking to me. This is literally THE recipe to a bad conversation. Usually after the person finished speaking, I would say what was on my mind and they would give me this look like “did you even listen to what I said?” Admit it, you’ve probably been in a conversation before and found yourself thinking of what you’re going to say next…as the other person is still talking to you. Yeah, don’t do that. You may end up missing out on what the perso

“You are the sum total of the people you meet and interact with in the world. Whether it’s your family, peers, or co-workers, the opportunities you have and the things that you learn all come through doors that other people open for you.” ― Tanner Colby The Impact of Social Capital During my trip to Vietnam in January 2018, I met a local economics professor at a bus station in Sapa, northern Vietnam.  Because of his background as a college teacher, he spoke fluent English. Hence we were able to communicate by having meaningful conversations. After we connected, he gladly gave me his contact informa 

 This is by far one of the most important things I’ve ever learned. In fact, I’d say its proper application is essential to transition into adulthood. I don’t know who you are. I don’t know where you come from. I don’t know what you look like. I don’t know your history. But I do know this: right now, a small amount of the things you do on a daily basis account for a majority of your current or potential success and happiness in life. This is classic Pareto principle which states “80% of your results come from 20% of your effort”. In some places and situations it may be as dramatic as 90/10 or even  

SALES LESSONS 101 FROM A HOMELESS GUY  I just gave a homeless guy $8.50. Why? Because I’m nice? Because I’m tired? Because I’m travelling alone and felt like a little conversational companionship? A combination of the above maybe but they’re not the real reason. It’s because he put the hard sell on me. $8.50 is nothing in the grand scheme of things. I’m sitting in a flash restaurant writing this, the kind where people wear their nice shirts and say things like, ‘I’ve been so busy lately!’, then spend 6-hours sipping $15 drinks. I’ve been here the past 3-hours (4-hours now) ordering food to chew up time. 

To be relentless.  I was a small kid back then. I had a Cadbury chocolate which looked like this:  I went to my father and asked him to open the wrapper for me. But instead of simply removing the wrapper, he asked me to observe how he was removing the wrapper. So that from the next time I did not have to rely upon him to enjoy my Cadbury. So, I looked. But the process of unwrapping Cadbury confounded me. After he unwrapped a little, he turned the Cadbury and asked me to unwrap its other end. I was already waiting to have my Cadbury and here he was asking me to do the impossible of unwrapping the cove 

 I’ve been around for over three decades now. If you were to ask 100 people of all different age groups if three decades was a long time, you’d probably get a mixed result. The young ones would say “sure, is he my grandpa? He’s about to retire.”The ones around my age would say “eh, probably.”The ones a little older than me would say “I’m so jealous, you’re young!”The oldest ones would say “forget it, he’s still a baby.”I definitely don’t consider myself a baby. The fine lines on my face, my thick beard, and my thinning hair definitely agree. I’d ideally love to keep only one of those. But no matte 

When I was 19 I spent 6 weeks learning Spanish and then shipped myself off to Southern Mexico to preach religion.  Sounds crazy, but that’s actually a pretty common thing in my community. And while my religious views have changed dramatically since then, I learned a skill there that I believe to be my most valuable. It’s a skill that I’ve been able to put in practice thousands and thousands of times in my schooling, in my personal life, and now as we’re building a hyper-growth tech company. When I arrived, I got to work with a heavy-accent Chilango from Mexico City who taught me the most valuable 

In the business world, there are many skills that are valuable. Especially if you’re the owner of a small startup (or hope to be) you’ll often need to learn and possess as many skills that relate to your certain area of expertise as possible. The 21st century market is a pretty cold place, and if you aren’t absolutely spectacular at what you do, chances are you or your business won’t survive for too long. If you’re an engineer or architect of sorts, it’s probably important you’re pretty damn proficient with the whole math thing. If you happen to be a designer, or own a clothing brand, you better  

Today, I watched Sadhguru’s talk at Nalsar Law University.  They asked him all kinds of questions, like “Why should I stand for the National Anthem?”, “Why does such and such rule exist?”, and so on. I noticed one thing over and over again, so many times until Sadhguru spelled it out himself. The students were asking rhetorical questions. Their opinions and staunch beliefs were poorly disguised as questions. It was entertaining to hear Sadhguru answer them, but that’s not the point. The point is that most questions are like that nowadays. Most of us ask questions just to see whether we know more tha 

 I couldn’t breathe. Sweat poured from my face, pooling on the ground below me in a puddle of exhausted futility. Blood rushed to my head and I could feel each heartbeat pounding in my temples as if someone was using my skull as a snare drum. My vision started to blur and I knew I was only a few seconds away from blacking out. “Do something Andrew!”, my mind screamed. I tried to hold on. To fight. To keep breathing. If for just one second longer. The harder I tried to maintain my grip over my consciousness, the faster it seemed to slip away. As my strength waned, the arm wrapped around my throat tight 

Do not force your nature but learn to strengthen it. I am left-handed. In my childhood. There was only one teacher who put a massive patience with me in order to convince me writing by the most common hand in the world. She explained the usefulness of being a right-handed person every single day. As result, I often got a little punishment, for example knocking a table when I was writing by left hand. It seemed to be very difficult for me at the moment. How could a kid under 10 years old understand the advantages of using a right hand based on a life basis? I had been stuck with the question for a 

How do you develop your social abilities?
Growing up, I was one of the shyest and most socially awkward people you’d ever meet. I didn’t know how to hold eye contact. I didn’t know how to hold a conversation. And I sure as heck didn’t know how to get a beautiful woman to go on a date with me. … Today it’s a slightly different story. Today, I get to party with multimillionaires and celebrities like Ashton Kutcher, Lance Armstrong, Naveen Jain (billionaire founder of Moon Express), and even Matthew McConaughey (alright, alright, alright).

Here is 3 simple tips you can implement right away to improve you social skills: 1. Stop Just Smiling and Nodding - You know when you miss something the other person says because you're thinking, instead of fully paying attention. It's totally normal... everyone does it from time to time. It's actually not your wandering mind that disconnects you from a conversation.

Here are my 10 ideas (and #10 is my favorite): 1. Look people in the eyes. 2. Smile. 3. Ask questions. But don't kill another person with them as if inspector is investigating on them. Rather, show genuine interest for other person's life and experiences. 4. Don't talk too much. When someone tells a story, stop your urge to follow up with an example from your own life. Rather say: "Wow, that's cool!" 5. When you introduce someone, make him or her a superstar. "This is my friend Tom. I met him at my first workplace and he saved my ass when I had my first project deadline! I cannot imagine what would

I was most proud when I made chicken noodle soup from scratch and found it to be fairly easy. Check out the full post here: Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup From Scratch - All Natural &amp; Good - DIY What you need: For the broth – 3.5 pound whole chicken1 head of garlic (cut in half horizontally)2 carrots cut into chunks2 celery sticks cut into chunks2 onions (quartered)1 tablespoon whole peppercorns2 bay leaves4 sprigs of thymeWater (to cover) For the soup – 1 tablespoon olive oil1 large onion (diced)3 garlic cloves (minced)2 carrots cut into chunks2 celery sticks cut into chunks2 cups shred 

Croissants, hands down.  My pastry instructor was brutal. Like, Gordon Ramsay with a rancid crab cake brutal. Throw stuff on the ground and stomp on it sort of thing. Really. So when we did croissants, no one produced one that pleased him, but we moved on, because there was no pleasing him. On the first day of class, he had said “If you want to practice these recipes at home, you may take ingredients for personal use, just log them on the inventory sheet.” Every day, I took the ingredients for croissants home and spent the evening rolling and turning and waiting. The next day I’d take my croissa 

Pasta Aglio e Olio - pasta with chili, garlic, and olive oil. Yumm!  First time I had it was some years ago at my favourite Italian restaurant and loved it. Then I thought… “$12?? Hmmm… I can do this…” So after some Googling and tweaking, I have it down pat. Why is it the favourite of all my recipes? It’s unique to me. I based it off of Emeril’s but made some changes too. I’m proud that I made it, IMHO, restaurant quality by mostly by myself.It’s sooo cheap! Even with the best quality pasta and olive oil, you are probably looking at $2 tops to make this.It makes a great staple recipe. It’s not som

My Polish grandmother made a delicious bread twice a year for all the male heirs in the family. They are, after all, the only ones worth having, according to her. When she died I was not left anything. No surprise. Unfortunately her bread recipe was not written down. I spent one solid year looking for that damn recipe. Everywhere. This was the seventies. Very labor intensive. I kept finding BOBKA — which is more like cake. I needed to find PLATSAK (phonetic spelling). Having eaten it twice a year for more than 20 years, I knew what I was looking for! Apparently not too common. One day I saw an a 

Warning: contains images some users, especially vegetarians and vegans, may find disturbing. Although, to be honest, even if you aren’t a vegetarian or a vegan, you way well find them disturbing anyway. I’ve talked about this recipe before on this site, and last weekend I visited my local butcher and, on an impulse, decided to order the principal ingredient. Braised half pig’s head. Say hello to Ed.  I call him that because he is half of ‘head’, ha ha. Ed is resting on some shallots and garlic sweated in duck fat, and is in the process of being part-submerged in stock. There’s also a glass of brandy  

The perfect eggless cake Inspired by Yolanda Gamp, I love baking and decorating cakes. Over the course of last 3 years I made around 15 cakes, each one better then the previous one! The main challenge i’ve had is for my recipe to be eggless After trying multiple replacers like chia seeds, yogurt , banana and condensed milk, after lots of trial and errors I was finally able to bake a perfectly textured, eggless vanilla cake that would not crumble into pieces when I cut it into layers. Not that crumbles ever stopped me from decorating, but having a perfect cake and not to worry about it breaking wa 

New England Clam Chowder. I had previously spent several weeks working on my gravy technique under my wife’s guidance when I caught a brief glimpse of chowder prep on some cooking show. The chef was making a white roux and talking about the ingredients that would be added to it when a light went on in my brain. I realized his chowder was essentially a much less thickened version of my gravy, which meant I should now be able to make homemade chowder - something I’d been missing ever since moving away from New England 20+ years ago. I asked my wife’s permission to try my hand at this, she advised  

It only took about fifteen years, but I finally mastered risotto! Enjoying beautiful, delicious, nourishing food is one of the true pleasures in my life. We like to cook in my house, so having a meal at a restaurant is usually a special occasion - and I like to make the most of the opportunity by ordering a dish that isn’t on the menu at home. Traveling in Italy years ago, I was introduced to risotto and it became a favorite special dish. At home in North America, if the restaurant offered risotto, I would enjoy it and long to have it more frequently. Everything I ever heard about risotto made it 

Idlis &amp; Dosas ! My hubby says I make the world’s softest Idli’s and my kids say I make the best golden &amp; crispiest dosas ever …. And once upon a time I fed Idli’s as an emergency food with an express chutney to my uncle and my uncle till date talks ’bout that impressive dish which he enjoyed so much :) I feel honored and proud to have won these awards and medals from my loved ones.

What’s the most valuable skill someone taught you?
“You are the sum total of the people you meet and interact with in the world. Whether it’s your family, peers, or co-workers, the opportunities you have and the things that you learn all come through doors that other people open for you.” ― Tanner Colby The Impact of Social Capital During my trip to Vietnam in January 2018, I met a local economics professor at a bus station in Sapa, northern Vietnam.  Because of his background as a college teacher, he spoke fluent English. Hence we were able to communicate by having meaningful conversations. After we connected, he gladly gave me his contact informa 

 This is by far one of the most important things I’ve ever learned. In fact, I’d say its proper application is essential to transition into adulthood. I don’t know who you are. I don’t know where you come from. I don’t know what you look like. I don’t know your history. But I do know this: right now, a small amount of the things you do on a daily basis account for a majority of your current or potential success and happiness in life. This is classic Pareto principle which states “80% of your results come from 20% of your effort”. In some places and situations it may be as dramatic as 90/10 or even  

SALES LESSONS 101 FROM A HOMELESS GUY  I just gave a homeless guy $8.50. Why? Because I’m nice? Because I’m tired? Because I’m travelling alone and felt like a little conversational companionship? A combination of the above maybe but they’re not the real reason. It’s because he put the hard sell on me. $8.50 is nothing in the grand scheme of things. I’m sitting in a flash restaurant writing this, the kind where people wear their nice shirts and say things like, ‘I’ve been so busy lately!’, then spend 6-hours sipping $15 drinks. I’ve been here the past 3-hours (4-hours now) ordering food to chew up time. 

To be relentless.  I was a small kid back then. I had a Cadbury chocolate which looked like this:  I went to my father and asked him to open the wrapper for me. But instead of simply removing the wrapper, he asked me to observe how he was removing the wrapper. So that from the next time I did not have to rely upon him to enjoy my Cadbury. So, I looked. But the process of unwrapping Cadbury confounded me. After he unwrapped a little, he turned the Cadbury and asked me to unwrap its other end. I was already waiting to have my Cadbury and here he was asking me to do the impossible of unwrapping the cove 

 I’ve been around for over three decades now. If you were to ask 100 people of all different age groups if three decades was a long time, you’d probably get a mixed result. The young ones would say “sure, is he my grandpa? He’s about to retire.”The ones around my age would say “eh, probably.”The ones a little older than me would say “I’m so jealous, you’re young!”The oldest ones would say “forget it, he’s still a baby.”I definitely don’t consider myself a baby. The fine lines on my face, my thick beard, and my thinning hair definitely agree. I’d ideally love to keep only one of those. But no matte 

When I was 19 I spent 6 weeks learning Spanish and then shipped myself off to Southern Mexico to preach religion.  Sounds crazy, but that’s actually a pretty common thing in my community. And while my religious views have changed dramatically since then, I learned a skill there that I believe to be my most valuable. It’s a skill that I’ve been able to put in practice thousands and thousands of times in my schooling, in my personal life, and now as we’re building a hyper-growth tech company. When I arrived, I got to work with a heavy-accent Chilango from Mexico City who taught me the most valuable 

In the business world, there are many skills that are valuable. Especially if you’re the owner of a small startup (or hope to be) you’ll often need to learn and possess as many skills that relate to your certain area of expertise as possible. The 21st century market is a pretty cold place, and if you aren’t absolutely spectacular at what you do, chances are you or your business won’t survive for too long. If you’re an engineer or architect of sorts, it’s probably important you’re pretty damn proficient with the whole math thing. If you happen to be a designer, or own a clothing brand, you better  

Today, I watched Sadhguru’s talk at Nalsar Law University.  They asked him all kinds of questions, like “Why should I stand for the National Anthem?”, “Why does such and such rule exist?”, and so on. I noticed one thing over and over again, so many times until Sadhguru spelled it out himself. The students were asking rhetorical questions. Their opinions and staunch beliefs were poorly disguised as questions. It was entertaining to hear Sadhguru answer them, but that’s not the point. The point is that most questions are like that nowadays. Most of us ask questions just to see whether we know more tha 

 I couldn’t breathe. Sweat poured from my face, pooling on the ground below me in a puddle of exhausted futility. Blood rushed to my head and I could feel each heartbeat pounding in my temples as if someone was using my skull as a snare drum. My vision started to blur and I knew I was only a few seconds away from blacking out. “Do something Andrew!”, my mind screamed. I tried to hold on. To fight. To keep breathing. If for just one second longer. The harder I tried to maintain my grip over my consciousness, the faster it seemed to slip away. As my strength waned, the arm wrapped around my throat tight 

Do not force your nature but learn to strengthen it. I am left-handed. In my childhood. There was only one teacher who put a massive patience with me in order to convince me writing by the most common hand in the world. She explained the usefulness of being a right-handed person every single day. As result, I often got a little punishment, for example knocking a table when I was writing by left hand. It seemed to be very difficult for me at the moment. How could a kid under 10 years old understand the advantages of using a right hand based on a life basis? I had been stuck with the question for a 

What is the best way to overcome laziness/procrastination?
Lack of physical exercise and spending more time in virtual social sites could be a reason these days. If this is even partly true you should assume to be the only reason. Now think once again if the quest in the subject is sincere or a passing thought or one activity to raise a question. We form certain habits unknowingly is like placing concrete, sand and cement and if we continue this passion it works like watering and tries to get hardened. Once it becomes hard the mind loses its potential or the ability to harness the potential. We need to change the habit as our necessary need making our cons 

A few weeks ago, I found myself watching more YouTube videos than usual and been putting off some works for sometimes. Just like everyone else, I procrastinate. And trust me, it happens more times than you think. If you’ve found yourself putting off important tasks over and over again and you can’t control it, you’re not alone. In fact, it isn’t a bad thing for most people to procrastinate to a certain degree – but procrastination has affected some people chronically and destroyed their relationship, career, and life. Many factors cause us to procrastinate. However, I’m only going talk about one 

Laziness is the desire to be idle, to do nothing, and to resist effort.  It is a state of passivity and of letting things stay as they are.Sometimes, we enjoy being a little lazy, such as after working hard for several hours, or when we stay in bed on a very cold day. However, if doing nothing occurs too often, something has to be done about it. In order to carry out our chores, work efficiently, live to the fullest, and achieve success, we must learn how to overcome laziness. Simple Tips for Overcoming Laziness: 1) Break down a task into smaller tasksWe often avoid tasks because we find them too  

Dear Friend, When you are conditioned against something, then you do not want to do it. This is laziness. Nothing else is laziness. When you don’t want to do something, you feel lazy. It’s as simple as that. And why do you not want to do anything? Because all your wants emanate from your conditioning. Conditioning never wants to do something  which goes against it. And, conditioning is always against something  which threatens to dissolve it. Have a sharp look at what you call as  your ‘wants’. We often say, “I don’t want this!” and we take this as an  expression of our individuality. “My wish!” O 

 I’ve been studying the roots of procrastination and how to overcome it for several years now. I’ve learned a lot of things but the most revealing one by far has to do with how the human brain works. For example: when you eat a good piece of food, your brain starts to light up. It sends a signal to your brain of positive reinforcement. In the neurochemical form, this is known as dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter responsible for motivation. Dopamine signals to your brain “this activity is good, do more of it” because it has highlighted that activity as beneficial to your survival. Dopamine help 

Thanks for A2A… In order to find a solution to procrastination and laziness, we must understand why we procrastinate in the first place. I call it uppercutting your future self in the face.  Oddly enough, it's not the fear of failure that pushes us to procrastinate but the fear of achievement. Achievements scare us more than failing. And so we romanticize the idea of achieving great success, accumulating tons of skills and rocking it as badass kings and queens of our own rich and vast kingdoms of awesome. But before we even get started we are screwed up by our own subjectivity. We put up these bl 

I don’t think their will be a single person in this world who would like to be lazy and procrastinator, but still most of us suffering from laziness in small or large scale. So why is that ? I will refer few examples which i learned from the book “Thinking, fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman , first to understand few areas of our mind and how they work. Example 1-  When you see this image above, your mind quickly tells something about this girl, like she is struggling with some problem which she solving and she is not understanding something. you knew is she angry. you sensed that this girl is not  

The best way is the way that works for you. I can shower you with advice, but until you pick one tip and implement, it will be all in vain. And quite often, you don't pick and implement because it simply doesn't work for you. Goal Settings Didn’t Work… for Me An excellent example is Jim Rohn's advice about goal setting. It worked for him very well. I respect Jim Rohn very much; he is the man that shaped my personal philosophy the most. However, when I first studied his teachings six years ago I wasn't able to implement his goal setting advice. Goals always eluded me and they were a source of frus 

If You Don’t Learn This You’re Doomed To Be A Loser For Ever  The very best way to learn how to break through procrastination is to learn to motivate yourself and in turn build the right habits into your life. What? I can learn to motivate myself? This can’t be true, my motivation comes and goes and never seems to stick around at the right time! What can I do. Chill out. Take a deep breather and read on. That motivation comes and goes is completely normal and human. Even the most successfull people in our society experience this. That is why we need motivation to get the ball rolling and use this in 

Procrastination... our PRUDENT SIDEKICK? If we want to incline ourselves to make the right decisions upon overcoming procrastination, why not ask; "What is the best way to NOT overcome laziness and procrastination?" Understanding about the incorrect decisions made when trying to eliminate laziness and procrastination, will induce us to think in terms of why some people still fail to do so. There are countless blog articles, podcasts, some books, and educational videos out there explaining ways as to how to overcome procrastination, but are they ensuring we won't be failing forever?

How do I develop razor-sharp focus?
I’ve struggled with focus my entire life. I was diagnosed with ADD, ADHD and just about everything in between. For the longest time, I allowed this to hinder my self esteem and fester as the toxic belief that I “Wasn’t good enough”. Today, I’ve learned that focus is an acquirable skill whether you have any sort of attention disorder or not. If you follow the right habits and mindsets, you can develop razor sharp focus in a startlingly short amount of time.

In the movie Pixels, there is a scene where Tetris blocks suddenly fall from the sky, arrange themselves on buildings in the real world and thus destroy them.  Remember this image, for it’ll be your guide towards razor-sharp focus.  In 1990, Vladimir Pokhilko wanted to stay at a friend’s house in Tokyo for a week. There was only one problem: They had a brand new Game Boy. And Tetris. At night, geometric shapes fell in the darkness as I lay on loaned tatami floor space. Days, I sat on a lavender suede sofa and played Tetris furiously. During rare jaunts from the house, I visually fit cars and trees  

 DON’T SKIP FOREPLAY, TEASE YOUR MINDRather than rushing into doing the task you are getting ready to do, set a timer for 5 minutes. Sit in front of the book you want to read or the work you are getting ready to do. Now just thinking about the subject. The questions you have. What you remember. What interest you about it. Let the fantasy of what you are about to do become vivid. Do this until the timer hits zero. The reason you want to do this is that you want to spend time getting rid of all the thoughts that don’t have to do with the task at hand. All of those other thoughts take up psych

Here are 7 of my favorite habits that have helped me to stay focused on what I want to do. #1. Starting the day with a focus-boosting question.

The good news is that focus is one of the most valuable skills you can have and also one of the most trainable. I call it a skill, but it’s really more of a meta-skill or skill amplifier, in that it makes you better at pretty much everything you’re already good at. Add that to the fact that it’s actually relatively easy to train, and you’ll quickly see that improving your focus is, hands down, about the highest ROI activity you can possibly do. So, here’s a few things that will help you. Focus and productivity boil down to working memory management. Your working memory is tiny but powerful, holding

How do I increase concentration during study?
When it comes to studying, there are a myriad of distractions. If you want to be able to study for extended sessions, you will need to build up to it. The distraction can be a call from a customer or maybe your buddy stopping by to see if you want to try out the new restaurant on the corner for lunch. After each distraction, you pick up where you left off only to be distracted once again by that familiar ping and a notification pop-up letting you know that a new email has arrived. You try to ignore it, but see that it’s from your mom and it could be something important. Aside from the external d

Attention or concentration is a critical mental skill. In fact, many memory complaints have nothing to do with the actual ability to remember things.

But you can also increase your concentration level by: Focus on the task at handAvoid and eliminate distractions. Tune out everything else. The harder the ta

 There is ONE thing, one thing that people NEVER seems to get when it comes to concentration.

I used to love the gym. I would spend hours thinking about my workout, what I should eat, what new training techniques to follow, designing my ultimate program. But…I was supposed to be studying engineering. I used to love going out partying on Friday and Saturday nights. It was so much fun. Meeting girls, having drinks, life was good. But…I was supposed to study the next morning. Yea right, not after 4 hours’ sleep and a hangover. I would look for anything else to focus on apart from studying. The only constant was the lingering guilt in the back of my mind. Why couldn't I concentrate on something  

You asked “how do I focus on my studies because I am finding it is very difficult.” I would start answer by saying write down why it is very difficult and address each question. I am assuming what could be the difficulties you are facing and how to solve each. 1. Phone is a distraction. I was given a phone in 2nd year of MBBS (more as a GPS device for my parents) to know my whereabouts but I know children these days get phones from school time itself. So by the time they reach college they are deeply addicted to phones. How to overcome it? Switch off the mobile data, keep phone in silent mode (op 

You see there is a reason for a person to be bright. It's the concentration and the qualities that come along with it, that gives that ability. It's a mental thing, mental development. Along with that development comes, being good at : learning things, memorizing them, recalling them fast, analyzing the combinations and patterns, logic, + reduction in stress / anxiety with the loading of studies, which puts a perfect skill platform for studying. All you need to do is strengthening your concentrating power. For that you could do a simple meditation. If you do this, soon you'll find out you're th 

 When you find yourself distracted during studies, focus on two things mentioned below #1. Your surroundings Every object around you, every person around you and the space you’re present in creates your surroundings. You cannot concentrate if you’re in the middle of a traffic. You cannot concentrate if people around you are continuously talking. Your workspace matters and affects your work more than you think it does. Your co-workers matter even if you don’t communicate with them. How to make sure that your surroundings isn’t affecting your concentration? Remember the 3P’s mentioned below Place : The

Everyone will expect you to be concentrated but no one one will teach you how to be concentrated.Focus and concentration always go side by side.If your focus is not strong your concentration power can never improve.Focus and concentration requires discipline and discipline always requires focus and concentration. Both are the complementary needs of each other.The most important fact about concentration is that you will automatically be concentrated on the things which you love doing it.So always try to make studies your passion and never a work loa 

Well. Staying concentrated on studies is really not an easy task. But if you really want to focus, it’s not that hard too. These tips can help you, I think. Because this is how I do.

I want to study, but I waste my whole day without doing anything significant, and am unable to concentrate. What should I do?
I have studied... a lot.. I have studied in night, in the morning, basically anytime needed. I have studied 2 days before exams and 2 mins before exams! I sometime wake up at 11 AM, sometimes at 8 AM. I have stayed up whole night, and once for straight 36 hrs. I have studied 2 hrs for an exam and 2 months for an admission test. As an effect, I have a balanced sample space to answer this question. Bottom Line: There is no way of studying. Discussing a "way" or a "rule" to study is fruitless. These ways deal with the stem, you need to reach and address the root.. YOUR BRAIN. The key is to put you  

Concentration is like a muscle, you need to exercise it to get better at it. There can be a number of reasons why you find it hard to focus but one of the main things you need to be clear about is whether you find it hard to concentrate on everything or just your studies or only particular parts of your studies. Depending on the answer it can affect what approaches you take. But for the sake of hopefully being the most help and not making things confusing I will give a list of some general things to consider: Choose a quiet, clutter free space to study (or as quiet and tidy as possible)Set your

 There are lot of students like you. Almost everyone get distracted and seek ways to improve focus but not stick with it for a longer period. You know why? Because Internet, TV, Phone and other ways of distractions seem pleasurable. Your mind find it easy to do as it not pushing you to experience discomfort. You doing it everyday constantly and constant efforts is the key that making these two activities easier to do rather than focus to study. With said that, you can change it.

You should start today! Take that small but significant step towards your goals because the start is something that stops most people. All of us cherish some of the most coveted dreams in our minds. However, only a handful of those dreams are metamorphosed into reality. This is mainly because we are afraid of taking the first step towards our goals.  As you have said that you want to study but you waste your whole day without doing anything significant. Have you ever sat and wondered what exactly you do that steals your time? Is there something that worries you, or upsets you, or keeps you from st 

Here's a few thoughts. Know why you are studying. What program are you in? Why? What do you hope to achieve in the long term? Why are you taking each course? What kind of grades do you need? What happens if you fail? Short term and long term. Recognize that studying is a skill. There are different methods and systems. You need to make one that works for you, and you may need to try a few different things - the other answers have lots of suggestions about those methods and high-level motivation.Make sure you have a high-level calendar, for the whole term. Finals, mid-terms, assignments, papers. 

I have read a bunch of these answers and I agree with Suman kanuwat. I have ADD (disorganised type) making it challenging for me to study for long blocks. I also get overwhelmed when I think about the study because when I look at it I see a whole semester of every subject and my brain just says "no way, too much!".  Having said that, I will also add that I am a high distinction post graduate, because eventually I learned to break it up.

“If the eye is patient enough, it will get a clear view of the nose.” - Anonymous I like to keep things simple. If we can be calm enough and take some time to reflect, we won’t need to search too far to get answers to many questions we ask. The answers are right within us. I was also experiencing serious distractions. It was extremely difficult for me to focus on a particular thing for long enough and get it done. It was difficult for me to maintain a line of thought before my mind wanders. I was spending too much time and getting too little done. It got so much and became a matter of serious co 

Actually, focusing is not so difficult. Here’s what I mean.. Now, think about this common example: When you have enough clothes, tie, pants, lingerie and shoes, you get trapped in indecision over which one to wear, what colour matches, for what event and so on. Isn’t it? I get into this confusion too. It becomes so hard to focus on that one thing to do or pick among all these choices. Hours get lost over this indecision. So, logically, having enough brings some form of confusion. Right? When you have just 1 piece of everything, your choice can only be 1, except you have to borrow or your friends are

 This is William Jefferson Clinton (popularly known as Bill Clinton). He’s known for being the 42nd President of the United States, and for the infamous White House scandal.

How can I study 14-16 hours a day without losing concentration?
 Realize one simple truth first: You can never LOSE your concentration. Every minute of your life you are going to be concentrated on something. The only difference is what that will be! Now our concentration is going to shift from time to time. It just happens. That’s part of our biology. All it is is being attentive to danger and threats. Most things do not threaten us that much anymore in today’s time, yet our concentration still shifts. That being said, the only thing you need to stay concentrated for long periods of time is to bring your mind back to the place you want it to be. Close your eyes

From November 2016 to November 2017, I continuously studied for 15 hours (give or take). Hum tab hi kaam karte hai jab pichwade pe aag lagti hai.

Everyone in my friends circle studied for the same amount of hours I studied. Everyone concentrated 15 hours a day easily, the formula is hereunder.

You need to start realizing that even with short breaks, studying long hours (especially more than 6 hours) every day is simply an unrealistic and unproductive thing to do. Firstly, you need around 7 to 8 hours of sleep each day and more hours for your meals. All these have already takes a lot in each of your days. More importantly, if you ever try it, you may notice that it seems okay at beginning but in the following days, you are going to start feeling exhausted and a sense of burnout. Thus, it is not a good approach because you will not be able to study well in the next few days. So in order  

Though I am just a B grade fellow, I may have no such right to say everyone cannot do so. But according to my experience.

It’s interesting how everyone says “You can’t”. Let’s make clarify that: Everyone can study for a long-period of time even without losing focus. It depends how disciplined you are and how often you have done it. Your body will get used to longer periods of focusing on something. If you, at the end, have the same results like someone who takes regular breaks, gets enough sleep and food/water and studies in shorter blocks instead of 16 hours, is the other question. It really depends on you as a person and also on your discipline to train yourself. A few years ago I have studied 15 hrs/day for almos 

You can't. Your mind is supposed to be distracted because all your life you have trained it to be distracted even by small small things. You want to concentrate on studies for 15 hours(average) a day? Assuming you take 6 hours of sleep and 2 hours for other routine stuff viz exercise, meditation, and other things you are left with 16 hours. Now you aspire to study for 15 hours in a stretch, as that's the only practical way left since unfortunately we only have 24 hours in a day. To study 15 hours a day you need to be extremely extremely concentrated. Now tell me when was the last time you trained y 

If you really want to study that much, first of all you should ask yourself, why? Why? Because you want to score highest rank to get a good college. Why? Because you want the best job with high package. Why? Because you want to live a good and healthy life for rest of years and to support your family. That's really great. Unfortunately 90 to 95% of the students study to earn money or by family pressure. If you have seen the film ‘3 idiots’, i guess you know what i am talking about.

What is the best way to meditate? I find it really hard to focus, even for 10 minutes.
I have been meditating since the past 5 years now and I can tell you this…. it’s not that helpful. Let me elaborate. 99% of books, teachers, etc out there that think they know about meditation do not know anything about it. I like one teacher’s response about meditation. He calls it ‘mad attention’. In other words, it’s mad to think that you can take 30 minutes out of your life and sit there and think about nothing. So what happens is you OVERTHINK about everything bad going on in your life. It becomes the reverse of what it’s supposed to do. And what is meditation supposed to do? Some people say  

The best way to meditate is not to meditate. For beginners it is always struggle. Why because we have alwa been told to go external- grab this object, this relationship, this food, this cloth and grab all of them because we think they will provide happiness. This is a state when we feel we are inadequate, we are incomplete, and by bringing these objects and other things we will be filling that void. Meditation is a process of going inward. And since we have not practiced it, we don't know about it, the mind alwa takes us to external world as per its nature. There is no singel technique for medit 

Meditation is about letting go. In our busy modern lives our brain is overwhelmed by impressions from the environment. In such a situation, the real you, the soul can’t get through. Emptying the mind of this overburden is what meditation is about. That is easier said than done though. It is difficult in the beginning, but everything improves with practice. The reason it’s difficult to let go of thoughts is due to attachments, says Master Li Hongzhi. Attachments are things that are difficult to give up. The more we can give up attachments the easier it is to meditate. The first requirement for givi 

See, there are two ways only in life, I.e either in meditative state or not. Now, to reach such state, best way is not to put any effort. If you put a slight care even, then you miss meditation. In other words, as long as “you” are there, you can not reach such a state. In other words, you need to dissolve inside yourself. Then only you start getting a glimpse of it. There is nothing like good, or better or best. I repeat, you have to drop yourself. In other words, the “me”, “Mine” if arising, then you path becomes very hard, and you easily miss the charm of meditation. As I have mentioned, “You “

I started meditating recently. A technique that has worked well for me as a beginner is one that I learned from Noah Rasheta in his podcast, ‘Secular Buddhism.’ You can listen to the podcast episode (or read its transcription) here: 32 - How to Meditate - Secular Buddhism Noah proposes a 15 minute meditation which is broken down into three parts, hence the name, ‘threefold mindfulness mediation.’ I believe the structure of this exercise is helpful for beginners who feel overwhelmed by the idea of meditation and don’t know where to begin or how to ‘quiet the mind.’ Here’s a quick summary of the ex 

You find it hard to focus because it is hard to focus. The subconscious mind is active and is constantly throwing up thoughts for your consideration. Or you are receiving thoughts from others. It’s a never-ending barrage of mind fodder. The purpose of meditation is to take no thought. So you sit, close your eyes, a thought comes to you. You observe it and let it go. Then another comes, which leads to another thought, to another, and then a minute has passed with your mind running all over before you remember what you were doing. You bring yourself back to no thought. This repeats over and over an 

There are many answers given by different practitioners and you can meditate whichever way you think fit. I will answer the later half of your question about focus. You gotta try hard to focus or de focus, whatever it is that you wish to do. But here is the crunch, you may not be able to focus because you may not be supposed to. Sometimes we cannot do certain things as easily as others. When I couldn't focus on meditation or bring my mind together and the other way being de-focusing, my Guru gave me this advice- “don't bother so much about it.

Today we’ll join forces to defeat a common threat but if I get the chance I will whack you over the head with a spanner in the middle of the fight. Why miss such a good opportunity?

If aliens came to attack the Earth and were actually serious and competent about it, given the technology they would have to have control of just to get here, there would be no time for the countries of the world to coordinate any form of fight at all. They would all be beaten before they even realized they were under attack. Even if the aliens were incompetent like your standard movie aliens, it is almost guaranteed that some nations would not be willing to fight. Some would consider the fight unwinnable and seek to negotiate with the aliens, or stay neutral and lie low and hope the aliens will 

That's the science fiction scenario everyone believes in, but when the Persian Empire invaded Greece, many Greek city-states fought on the Persian side. And when the European colonial powers invaded the Americas, some First Nations sided with them against their traditional local enemies. That's how the Hurons were completely wiped out, for example. So I think that's a bit of wishful thinking. If Vladimir Putin thought he could get a better deal by siding with aliens against the rest of the world, do you think he would hesitate for a second? 721 views · View upvotes34Mats Andersson, Professional Translator English into Swedish (1991-present)Answered 1 year ago · Author has 9.8K answers and 70.6M answer viewsOriginally Answered: If aliens came to fight our planet would all countries put aside their differences to join forces to fight them?

I feel except China and Pakistan all other countries would readily join hands to fight the aliens.

But you will have to give us 50% of the land area.Entire of USA Russia and India would belong to us.After that you will have to give us Donald Trump and all world leaders alive so that we can jail them.Pakistan would ask: All aliens should also convert to Islam, this is our only wish.

The answer is no. Most native American tribes would sign away their lives to be rid of the white people. African countries and modern native American countries that are not recognized by European countries would join the aliens if it meant their own death just to destroy the colonial nations.

Not only are there origins entirely different(which you would think work in homelanders favor) their genes are different. Superman is John Wick a trained assasin, while the other is Juan Wick an immigrant janitor. He's just a pale representation. Let's go over abilities, background etc. Powers Laser Vision I love this guy's use of laser Vision, very refined, a far cry from the brute force attacks in the man of steel. E 

Superman. I don’t even need to drag out feats for this; in fact, while Superman matter of factly is stronger, faster, etc, than Homelander, for the sake of argument let’s pretend they’re actually perfectly evenly matched in those categories. Okay? Superman still stomps him…because Homelander has never fought anyone on his own level before. WARNING SPOILERS SHALL BE BELOW, THOU HAST BEEN WARNED ALSO, THIS RESPONSE WILL CONTAIN PANELS FROM THE COMIC INVOLVING CHARACTER DEATHS. GIVEN THE WORK IN QUESTION, THIS WILL BE GORY AS ALL HELL. This is mentioned in the comic; Vought had to go out of their way 

Superman pretty much, Comic, Animated &amp; DCEU versions stomp Homelander. Okay as far as we know, Homelander is a twisted, power corrupt version of the Big Blue Boy Scout  While Homelander is powerful, it is shown that he has never fought anyone on his level, as we can see how he basically one-shots everyone below his level &amp; therefore he will be quite inexperienced when facing beings like Superman, General Dru-Zod &amp; his other officers &amp; Doomsday who a is an ancient kryptonian deformity, meant to be the specimen of perfection. Homelander is mostly defined by his Laser vision ability  which can disint 

*WARNING THIS ANSWER WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS AND IMAGES THAT DISPLAY GORE AND VIOLENCE* . . . . . . . Subzero chance. Homelander in the comics is killed by Black Noir, which is revealed to be a clone of Homelander.    Not only that when Black Noir is already all messed up but he was able to withstand special ammunition fired at him. Then comes Billy Butcher with a crowbar and cracks open Black Noir skull. And the crowbar wasn't made of Adamantium, Kerenthium, or some virtually indestructible metal. It was a normal you walk into any store and buy, crowbar.     When Superman died fighting Doomsday the Cadmus Project  

I wish Homelander was as strong as Superman, that way we’d have someone of Bat’s intelligence and awareness take up the mantle of beating the shit out of Homelander, but unfortunately, Homelander isn’t as strong as Superman, and would probably even get killed if he tries to mess with the Man of Steel.  Origin: Homelander is a lab rat infused with a chemical with severe psychological issues, Superman is an altogether different species raised by loving parents who taught him compassion so that he’d use his powers for helping humansHeat and X-Ray Vision: Homelander has heat vision, Superman has it 

 Homelander gets godstomped by Superman , bcoz he’s superman . Superman is just on a whole other level , dude Superman outclasses Homelander in every factor . Whether its speed , combat speed , powers , striking strength , lifting strength , durability , Intelligence , skills , experience etc . Superman has fought villains like Faora ul , Zod , Doomsday [ who was troublesome even for Darkseid] , Darkseid , Steppenwolf and many other villains who are much more powerful than Homelander     Zod and Faora ul would stomp Homelander then how can you even let Homelander fight a guy who has moved suns , pas 

The Homelander is an ant to Superman. While he is a demonstration of what would happen if Superman were a selfish, narcissistic, arrogant jackass who doesn’t give a damn about nobody but himself, but he is far, far FAR weaker than Superman. Homelander can’t even lift up a mere plane, let alone the entire planet for 5 days, and moving multiple planets into a new Solar System and sneezing away stars. Plus Superman is very used to fighting and struggling against enemies on his level/above his level (Doomsday, Darkseid, Zod, Steppenwolf, Kalibak, etc.) Enemies who push him way past his limits. The 

Homelander is meant to be an evil version of Superman, and you can see this considering Homelander’s powerset is almost exactly the same as Superman’s, minus the breath abilities. However, Homelander was incapacitated by a bus getting dropped on him and getting sent into a cavern, while Superman could straight up stay in place because he’s tougher. Also, it is implied that Homelander can’t lift a plane, and that’s not me misreading something either, as in the episode, Homelander directly states when asked if he could lift the plane, “Even if I could, there’s nothing to push on but air.” It’s n 

The answer to this question is really definitive actually. It’s insanely clear who would win in a fight between the two. Now, I’m sure all of you know who DCEU Superman is, but if you don’t know who Homelander is, allow me to explain.  Homelander, from The Boys, is essentially directly based off of Superman. He’s an alien from outer space who landed on Earth(well at least that’s the hoax that was used to popularize him when in reality he’s just a kid injected with a super serum), where he developed his powers and essentially became the world’s greatest super hero. However, the difference between h 

Don't need Superman from DC Comics. Marvel Superheroes and Super Villains just strong enough to beat the shit out Home Lander. Normal Hulk: Normal Powered Anger Hulk is already superior to Home Lander in every physical aspects and concepts. Hulk just crushed Home Lander and defeated him fast enough more than he even known what hit him. Just like what Hulk do to Loki in Avengers 2012 events. Home Lander physical body cannot endure Hulk punch either. Since Black Noir killed Home Lander with just an single punch, when Black Noir is not stronger than any other Superheroes in both Marvel and DC comi 

In ROTJ did Luke really beat Vader at his best, or was Vader weakened by his own internal conflict and feelings for his son? Could Luke at that time beat Vader at his best?
Who would win, General Grievous or Rey?
Well, let’s see. General Grievous …Was trained in all seven (correct me if I’m wrong) forms of Lightsaber combat. He stalemated Mace Windu, one of the best lightsaber duelists among the Jedi Order, as well as Kit Fisto (In TCW). He killed Jedi Knight Nahdar Veb in mere seconds. He fought off four Jedi Masters at once. He Bested Obi-Wan twice (once in Season 2 of TCW, once in an unreleased episode for Season 7), and nearly won again in Revenge Of The Sith. Now, let’s move onto Rey Palpatine-I mean, Rey Skywalker (god I cringe every time I hear somebody say “Rey Skywalker) …Recieved little to no tra 

Quora 》》》 : Who would win, General Grievous or Rey? GENERAL GRIEVOUS (GG) was one of the fiercest warrior without Force Sensitivity. GG was a reptilian species from the planet Kalee. The Kaleesh were true warrior's and GG before his cybernetic conversions lead armies to many victories. Although GG didn't not use the Force, he understood how to fight Jedi and Sith as he trained under Count Dooku in the Art of lightsaber battle. The other advantage GG had was the power and speed GG gained from his cybernetic conversions. Fighting with four lightsabers (LS) at one time, was not part of a particular 

Well, most answers conflate the choreography of the Praetorian guard fight with who they were supposed to be. They had incredible armour… a light Saber could get stuck in. I think one of them would beat Grievous. They are both force insensitive and extremely skilled. The armour of the Praetorian seems superior. The scene was to counter this nonsense about the sequel hero and antagonist being unskilled. Reys training was… well…short, but Luke is far superior to Dooku. Also, Dooku had contempt for his metal monster pupil. Rey may have been trained by her father for a few years before being abando 

Listen, I like both characters. Grievous is an iconic figure of the saga and especially the prequels. Rey, while bit too OP, carries great motives and inspiration of no one becoming someone in the wider thing. Objectively speaking, General Grievous triumphs. No matter if we talk of Grievous from Canon or the one from EU, both counterparts are a challenge in the said case.  I don’t know where to begin even. Skills, cybernetics or just his cunning character. Regardless, Grievous is a true nemesis and nightmare for those who happen to fight him, or at least try to fight him. A good start is to dissect 

This… is a curbstomp. Quite literally.  Rey has had no real training. Sure, she’s strong with the force, but at this point she’s low-padawan level at best, high-Youngling level at worst. Grievous has demolished Jedi far stronger and more experienced than her. He stomped Shaak Ti… twice.  He defeated Ki-Adi Mundi, one of the most powerful Jedi in the era, and a respected duelist, in a matter of minutes.  He killed Adi Gallia, another council member.  In Labyrinth of Evil, he is able to stalemate Mace Windu in a duel, and even begin to learn Vaapad mid-fight just from watching Windu’s attacks, forcing the 

Matthew Culbertson I don't really understand why you would ask me Grievous vs Yoda, one of the most powerful Jedi of all time, and then ask me Grievous vs Rey (a Padawan at best) afterwards. But I'll answer the question anyway since I established that Yoda stomps Grievous. This still isn't a good match up, at all. Even if you use *ugh*…canon Grievous (yes I just said the C word right next to Grievous, forgive me God), Rey will still lose every time. I mean, come on. Grievous has fought Mace Windu to a stalemate while handicapped. This alone puts him at high council member at least. Speaking of wh 

As of The Last Jedi we actually have enough reasonable context to have a stab at Rey and Kylo Ren versus answers. So let’s celebrate by seeing how she fares against the butt monkey of the Separatist fleet, General Grievous. … … You ready? This is gonna be great. … … … … Rey can’t beat Grievous.  Oh, don’t look at me like that. I estimate Rey to be somewhere near Ahsoka’s level as a Padawan. Not halter top Ahsoka, who can behead four Mandalorians. I mean tube top Ahsoka, who has the attitude and stature of a very bossy dachshund.  What? You were a scrub at one point, get over it, we all are scrubs at some p 

All right, let’s see. General Grievous was a Jedi killing master. He was trained in all seven forms of lightsaber combat by Darth Sidious and Count Dooku.  In Legends, Grievous defeated 7 Jedi at once, including Ki-Adi Mundi, Shaak Ti, and K’krukh.  Grievous was, in fact, so good that Obi-Wan Kenobi, a master of the defensive form 3, Sorseu, was sent to defeat him. Each of Grievous’s lightsabers can rotate up to 20 rotations per second.  Now, how good is Rey? What lightsaber form does Rey use? She doesn’t use one. Her strikes are basic at best. She looks like she’s swinging a baseball bat.  She literal 

Grievous is almost unbeatable in a lightsaber fight. Even the most expert Jedi Masters (like Kit Fisto, Obi-Wan or, speaking of non Jedi, Darth Maul) always rely on The Force to defeat him. So far the only one who defeated him using nothing but the sword have been Count Dooku. Not only is Rey clumsy and inexpert with the sword (she know literaly nothing of the seven forms, she just rely on instict and rage) but she also doesn’t seem to use The Force in her fights very much (again: because she has no training). So she would end up pretty much like this  Grievous 

Having only seen as far as The Force Awakens, I’d put my money on Rey. And she’d do it with one hand tied behind her back, while simultaneously rescuing some drowning kittens she noticed a British sounding white man dump in a river in another galaxy (using the power of the Force), making a perfect souffle that never collapses, and developing a revolutionary new method of reattaching limbs so they’d be fully functional and fluent in 15 different musical instruments, despite having no formal medical or musical training. And she’d be asleep at the time. 686 views · View upvotes34John PattersonAnswered November 14, 2020

If every single country got into a war with no alliances, who would win and why?
I doubt nukes would come into play very quickly, as countries who use them would do so knowing that they will get flattened themselves if they do. It’s too risky. Although there are no alliances, is it possible that countries will team up with one another temporarily, with the intention of killing each other later. The USA steamrolls its way through North America, quickly conquering Canada and Greenland. The Caribbean islands know that if they side with either the USA or Mexico, they will fall to them later, but figure they might stand a chance by siding together when one or both countries invad 

Nukes? Everyone dies Without nukes? Things start getting intersting I'll start with countries that could hold out against their immediate neighbors. This includes Active millitaryReservesGeographical location (natural borders, sea, mountains, forests, desertsStability (civil wars or unrest)Ability to quickly gain resources to survive on their ownGood economyThe ability to manufacture their own weaponsThis eliminates several countries so let's see what we have left  Note- I'm just drawing the general areas of places that could survive, keep in mind that this is completely hypothetical and don't take 

Seems pretty fun so I’ll have a go at it. If you allow nukes, pretty soon the world becomes a nuclear wasteland, with major cities destroyed and potential famines due to dust clouds kicked up by the blasts. India and Pakistan result in a nuclear war with about 200–300 nukes alone, India and China in total is about 500 nukes, enough to wreak havoc across Asia. Russia and China would be in the thousands, as Russia would attempt to obliterate China. Russia and America would be even more. It's a fair assumption that with enough time, every nuclear power would be launching every nuke it has. 20,000  

I’ll go from West to East, and assume that nukes are off the table so that the entire planet isn’t decimated North America This one’s pretty easy. The US strolls into Canada and takes the capital in a matter of weeks, then looks south and invades all of Mexico &amp; central America. I know you said no alliances, but it’s doubtful that the Canadians would even bother fighting for very long. They know that without the commonwealth or NATO the US would steamroll them, and because they’re not allied with Mexico they can’t launch a joint invasion. I think that the US - Canada war would be one of the more 

First Note: This is a Nuke-less war. Otherwise everyone dies. Also, I am not a military strategist, so if this answer seems stupid to you, the obvious military strategist, then there you go. Second Note: This answer assumes that all countries initiate mandatory military service. Third Note: This answer assumes severe technological and scientific advancement, as is logical in a world war. ————————————————————————————————————— PART ONE: The Red Sea (Background Music)  ————————————————————————————————————— First map:  The EU: Is immediately embroiled in various battles bet 

Antarctica would end up controlling the entire world. I know you just read that sentence and thought, “This guy’s either drunk or crazy.” I’m not crazy; my mother didn’t have me tested, but I’m not. And I have never consumed more than perhaps a few stray alcohol molecules on my food in my life. As it stands today, Antarctica is not a country. It is controlled by various countries, but the continent itself is not a country. Let’s go back to January 16, 2019, at 7:51PM US central time, when this sentence was typed. This is when the war starts. Here’s a crappy map of Earth (which I maintain is not fl 

Seems like a pretty cool scenario. Let’s get into it. And I’m gonna assume no nukes will be allowed cause no one wil win. Day 1: North America We start off in North America. Mexico invades Latin America and the Caribbean with little resistance. USA invades Canada, Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica. Pretty easy. Between USA and Mexico in North America. Day 1: South America: Now, South America. Brazil invades Guyana and Suriname. Guyana and Suriname surrender very soon. Uruguay surrenders to Brazil. Argentina invades Paraguay and Chile successfully. Colombia invades Ecuador pretty easily. Venezuela digs in for 

I agree with  Miguel Valdespino on this one, so no nukes...for now Year 1: The US (as mentioned) should run down Mexico and, with slightly more effort, Canada. It's troops stationed in Japan should quickly destroy that country as well. Central America should have less resistance than Mexico. The time it takes for the US to control the conquered countries, Brazil takes most of South America. Only parts of Colombia remain indepentdent. As for Africa, South Africa quickly conquers its neighbors, but their advance is halted by Ethiopia and Nigeria, who split Congo. Algeria and Morocco are at each oth 

If there was nukes…well end of humanity, sorry. If there wasn’t nukes…well uh hey, here is where the going gets a little hectic: USA: The USA will focus more on Canada and Mexico first as those two are the closest neighbours (Alaska (being a state of the USA) can also flank Canada). Because Canda doesn’t have a very big defence force, they are struggling against the US and eventually collapse under a tonne load of firepower, bmbing runs and artillery. Because the USA military haa total of almost 1.4 million, the US is able to split up its work and take both Canada and Mexico. This will take a wh

The first question would be “Where are the nukes?” The nuclear powers (the US, Russia, the UK, France and China) obviously have nuclear capability.India, North Korea and Pakistan are also known to have developed nuclear capability.Israel is also generally understood to have nuclear weapons, though they’ve never admitted to it.Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey are part of the NATO Nuclear Sharing program, so in the event of a no-holds-barred war, they have access to nuclear weapons (though these are technically the USA’s weapons)South Africa developed nuclear weapons in the ‘8

You are stuck in a room with an MCU character. To leave you have to defeat them. Who do you choose?
Deadpool. Yep, you heard me, the crazy red psychopathic bastard himself  And now you’re probably thinking “Pfft, look at this guy! Who the hell does he think he is? Talking like he can even lay a punch on Deadpool” Well, I’m sure the term is “You are stuck in a room with an MCU character. To leave you have to defeat them. Who do you choose?” but if you read the said challenge again, you can see that nothing says anything about a ‘physical battle’, right? Still, how am I going to defeat Deadpool? I mean, this guy is pretty slick, right? Yeah, no, fortunately I know one weakness that Wade Wilson has. H 

It didn’t say it had to be a main character. But, despite this character not having any lines, it is perhaps the most important character of all. Hence, I choose… The Rat From Endgame  A formidable foe, I know. Without this very pivotal rat, Scott Lang never would have escaped the Quantum Realm, and half the population of the universe may have remained dusted. This rat is truly a force to be reckoned with. I sit in a locked room. I stare at the door in front of me, wondering how to escape. My eyes lower slightly. On the floor in front of me is a seemingly harmless looking rat. In front of it lies  

“So, I guess we’re just gonna be stuck in here for a while?” I ask. “Looks like it.” comes the short reply. “And the only way out is for me to defeat you?” “Yup.” “I suppose we’ll be here a long time, then…..”, I think to myself. I look around the room. It’s rather spacious; a fully stocked kitchen that seems to magically replenish itself, massive master bathrooms with jacuzzis for each of us, large bedrooms furnished to our own specific aesthetic tastes, a large entertainment system with all of our favorite films, a state of the art gaming system that plays every game in existence regardless of co 

Thanos. Yes clearly Thanos…. ideally with the infinity gauntlet and all the stones. I’d sit him down and have a reasonable talk with him. I’d then explain to him why his plan is completely stupid. If you arbitrarily cut the population in half you actually wind up screwing everyone over not making things better. True fewer people means less drain on resources in the short term BUT it means many more deaths and eventually the population problem will happen again. The problem is infrastructure and the people in power. Let me use Earth as an example. First if you got rid of half the people food is g 

So after giving it a lot of thought and applying my personal moral &amp; ethical limits on myself I have chosen two characters, one male &amp; one female. Both are in their 30’s irl and I am 20 years their senior. Here goes: first of all for my male opponent that I have to beat in an actual physical fight I choose someone I haven’t seen anyone else pick yet. That person is  Mr. Harrington (aka Martin Starr) because of the fact he has no super powers, his character acts afraid &amp; clueless and I am pretty sure I can take him since I am slightly bigger &amp; quicker than you may think. For my second choice I choos

Korg.  This is how I plan for it to go. I look up from my computer after reading a question to find myself in a large and spacious room. A large, decked out, modern kitchen on one side, and an open sitting room on the other. But what I can’t believe is sitting on one of the cozy armchairs is none other than Korg himself. Korg: Oh, hey, Anne. You’ll have to beat me to get out of here. Blueberry? Me: Uh, I’ll take a blueberry. After making some small talk while eating the surprisingly delicious blueberries, I come up with a plan. Me: Korg, do you want to play a game? Korg: Sure. Me: We have to make a pot 

I’m assuming that I have to defeat them in combat. Honestly, I don’t care who I’m stuck in the room with, as long as they’re nice enough to not want to kill me. Actually, someone with strength levels that are possible for a human to at least almost match them in. You can chose the character for this, it doesn’t matter as long as they meet the requirements above. I’m just going to call them Character. Oh, and one more thing, I need my laptop. I wake up in a medium sized room. Character is standing there. Character: To leave, you have to defeat me. I’m sorry, I don’t make the rules. Me: Haha, ok. Y 

I would choose Tony Stark. Yes, Iron Man. Now, there is no way in hell I am winning a fight against Iron Man, that is pretty obvious. But here is the scenario: All of a sudden I find myself in a room, and across the room, staring right at me, is Iron Man. He looks extremely confused, he looks at me and asks me “Who are you?” He raises his hand and is prepared to shoot. I proceed to explain to him while trying not to, ehm.. soil myself, what happened, and I tell him that the only way either one of us is getting out of this room is if I defeat you in a fight. Tony: “You’re kidding right? You are tryin 

My answer might be a little weird but since you didn't say that we have to pick an avenger,so that means that I can pick just anyone,so here is the character which I will pick up,  Here she is,our adorable pepper Potts. I chose to pick her as my enemy so as to eliminate all chances of my defeat but I decide to have some fun first,so this is how it goes: Me: Hey. Pepper: Hey. Me: I heard about Tony's death,I feel very sad,he would have been a nice father and a nice husband. Meanwhile Pepper starts crying and is in tears,so now I think let's have some fun. Me: Don't cry,I also feel like crying after wat 

Could Mike Tyson in his prime beat a full grown gorilla (Mike has boxing gloves and the gorilla is bare handed)?
Gather round children, for another episode of “Alex States the Obvious.” Firstly, I like the fact you’ve specified that Mike has gloves and the gorilla hasn’t. I mean, it has zero impact whatsoever on the outcome, but it’s a nice touch. Without further ado… In the Blue Corner, we have the former Heavyweight Champion of the world, Mike Tyson.  Thith ithn’t very thporting Boasting a record of 50–6–2 (against humans) and with impressive knockout power (again, I must point out, against humans) he’s a tough opponent. However, although he’s a fine example of a human combat athlete, I keep coming back to th 

I see based on the responses you got so far, that you should put your money on the gorilla. It looks like a 50:1 situation, and probably for the right reasons. I’m still gonna play devils advocate here, just because the question allows it. So first of all, Mike Tyson is (or was at the pick of his career) one of our species best representative in terms of strength, speed, agility, endurance etc. Assuming that we can choose a gorilla that’s below average in its species in terms of combat skills and not the strongest alpha gorilla on the block, we can assume that the chances of Tyson surviving the  

Humans are severely underestimated in terms of how powerful we are unarmed. We may not have fur to protect against scratches and bites or claws to slash our enemies, but we are still big powerful apes. One of the most common myths about Gorillas is that they are several times stronger than humans. This is false. No strength tests have ever been done on gorillas. Some people say that gorillas are stronger than chimps and chimps are 4-6 times stronger than humans, therefore gorillas are much stronger than humans. This is also false, Chimpanzees are not 4 to 6 times stronger than humans. The study 

Of course the Gorilla is going to win. A chimpanzee, which is smaller than a human, can easily overpower any human. I can’t remember the exact statistic, but they are at least twice as powerful as a human being, because, frankly, civilization has made us soft. A wild animal only survives if it is fit. A human being can be weak, have poor eyesight (even be blind) etc etc and our civilization still allows us to survive. That means that our strength and overall fitness has declined over the millenia since we developed civilization. We have done the same thing to the Dog… a wolf can easily tear apart e

The dirt ground was cold, shaded by large-leafed jungle trees. A breeze whipped my hair slightly to the left, perfecting my already superb do. 10 meters ahead of me stands a black mass of muscle coated in a layer of leathery skin. The massive head mounted upon the broad shoulders made no attempt to hide the density of the creature's bones. It began to emit a deep guttural sound that pierced the air like a bullet, exposing the monster's teeth. I shifted my legs parallel to each other, the blade of my left foot facing the creature.

MYH16 Know what that is? It’s the gene responsible for giving primates a stupid strong jaw. “The MYH16 gene encodes a protein called myosin heavy chain 16, which is a muscle protein in mammals. At least in primates, it is a specialized muscle protein found only in the temporalis and masseter muscles of the jaw.”[1]  “In non-human primates, MYH16 is functional and the animals have powerful jaw muscles. In humans, the MYH16 gene has a mutation that causes the protein not to function.” Do you get where I’m going with this? “The bite strength of a gorilla is about 1300 pounds per square inch (PSI) which i 

Being nice, a muzzle is put on the gorilla which prevents any biting. Mike in glove vs barehanded gorilla… Mike has no chance.

I find it troubling that people ask such questions, hyper focusing on the extraordinary strength and power of such magnificent wild animals. Gorillas seem to get picked on most, I suppose because they are perceived as being close to human in their attributes. Why wouldn’t you ask if Mike Tyson could beat a lion which, while longer than a full-grown mountain gorilla is about the same weight? You automatically assume no human could defeat a lion in combat, and you’re right. Same with a gorilla which, in my view, would have a better than even chance of killing a lion in a fight to the death. The a

If every country's population was turned into that country's national animal, (all Americans bald eagles, all Australians kangaroos) who would win in a war?

What can we do here hmm… I see that your planet is at fourth stage of civilization and so you’ve separated your species into nations… I’ve got it! We’ll put your nations to fight to the death in a massive arena in that continent over there, a classic Battle Royale! But with a twist, turn the dominant primate species o 

I don’t think existence in real life means something here, so here we go. Rules: They will do the deathmatch on a Minecraft superflat server.We know we were transformed into animals for the sole purpose of killing other animals and we will fill this purpose.We know we are teams and we can’t kill our friends.We all have human-level capacity of thinking and human-level knowledge.We get zero time to prepare.Countries with more national animals (not national birds and etc) will have the population split.Let’s go. I tried searching all national animals, so i wouldn’t spend hours searching and found t 

BEIJING — The corpses of several million pandas littered the Communist Party of China’s headquarters in Zhongnanhai on Friday, shortly after India declared war by dispatching an invasion force of Bengal tigers. “We sent ’em through Tibet just to add a little special sauce to the festivities, so to speak,” Bengal Gen. Shere Khan told reporters from New Delhi. “We knew our guys were gonna encounter significant resistance along the way, so we dispatched an entire company.” Initial plans for a surprise attack were foiled when one of the invading tigers failed to bury his excrement and a spy got word 

I think it all depends on how you would go about it. Some countries have several national animals or even mythical creatures. So if a country has several national animals/mythical creatures I think it would be only fair to divide them into equal parts and not make all people to just one of those animals/creatures. India has five national animals and a population of around 1.3 Billion. If we divide them equally that would mean 260 Million Tigers, peafowls, cobras, dolphins and elephants. I think only the tigers, cobras and elephants will be successful during the war. If we would not count any my 

The winner in this war should all humans turn into their respective national animals would be the ones with large predatory birds. These would be Austria, Germany (black eagle), Colombia (Andean condor), Egypt (Steppe eagle), Hungary (Falco cherrug), Iceland (gyrfalcon), Mexico (Golden eagle), Panama (Harpy eagle), Philippines (Philippine eagle), Serbia (White eagle) and the United States (Bald eagle). Large birds are predators that can fly, have sharp talons to catch their prey, can eat any type of meat (thanks to their range), not get eaten by land animals (I am talking to you Indian tigers, 

Thanks to Dave Consiglio’s answer we actually have a Everyone Dies™ (hypothetical scenario). The national animal of the Vatican are themselves right? The national animal of Vatican are the men of Vatican. In this scenario, there are 451 men in the Vatican. If you look at the Economy of Vatican City, it exports stamps and uniforms, virtually useless for basic survival. Since the Vatican has to import hunting, farming, medical, military, transportation, electricity &amp; internet services from other countries one can safely assume the 451 men ain’t got those because the folks who do those, have turned  

So while many other answers are a lot more entertaining than my answer, they are all likely incorrect. One assumption I have is that there is no reproduction of species/’replenishment of troops’. Every single one bias’s the victor of war to be based on numbers and brute strength. War is won by Logistics, Strategy/Communication, or Attrition. Most of these are ignored in the responses. If everyone became an animal and were told they were at war with the world, there would be internal power struggles for who leads the pack and basic civil war culling thousands to millions of potential soldiers. Wh 

Is there any land animal that can beat a bear in a one on one fight?
If we are talking black bears, yeah there are a couple that can take them. As for the really big bruisers like Kodiak and Polar bears, full adults are really formidable and would wipe the floor with animals like lions or tigers, one on one. Their figures are astounding at 8–10 feet (2.4–3 meters) in length and weighing up to 1600 lbs (about 700kg) these are some animals not to be taken lightly. Armed with huge claws and a mouth full of razor sharp teeth, these animals are most formidable. What can take them? In my opinion, there are only three land animals that can beat them one on one: 3. Hippo 

Quite a few, actually. Smaller species like black and sloth bears can be killed by animals like lions and tigers :   Not so much the case with larger kinds like brown and polar bears however :   Even these giants are far from invincible however. Firstly, there are a few mostly aquatic animals that can move about on land. Saltwater crocs can reach 2,500 pounds, meaning it would be no mean feat for even a polar or Kodiak bear to tip them over and expose their unarmoured belly. And that's not even mentioning those unbeatably powerful jaws.  For smaller brown bear species like grizzlies, Nile crocs would pr 

Others on this thread have legitimately pointed out some of Earth’s most iconic megafauna (Elephants, Hippos, Rhinos, Bison, Saltwater Crocodiles, etc.). These are all acceptable answers, but let’s throw in some wild cards (no pun intended). 1. Porcupines There are animals that prey on porcupines, and bears (be they Black or Brown) would certainly seem to posses the dexterity, speed and intelligence required to make that tricky flipping motion with their claws and go for that soft belly. However, Porcupines are not like hedgehogs. They do not curl up in a ball. They flex the muscles on the back  

Sure. There are species of bear that weigh 120 lbs. full-grown. Plenty of animals could defeat one of those. BTW, that is the Sun bear - a species that lives in the forests of southeast Asia. A full-grown Siberian or Bengal tiger could make mincemeat out of one of them, and any bear, up to and including an American Black Bear. An adult male lion could also. Water buffalo, Cape buffalo, Indian Gaur (which weigh up to 3300 lbs.), elephants, rhinos, hippos, could all destroy any bear. I won’t even get into listing all the crocodilians capable of fighting a bear successfully, since you specify “la 

There are many different types of bears. If you're talking about small bears like the sloth bear, I'm sure that there are a good number of land animals that could beat them in a fight. If you're talking large bears like grizzly bears and polar bears, then there is one animal that comes immediately to mind: The African bull elephant:  The average adult African bull elephant weighs around 13,000 pounds. The largest bear is the polar bear and it weighs around 1,200 pounds. There are several factors that favor the elephant: Size — This is a Captain Obvious. The elephant weighs more than 10 times the w

There are many animal species that can comfortably overpower bears in their natural habitat. Since we concern here with the wider term bear which includes upto 8 members of the family ursidae,we can list a number of animals that are either potential threat to bears in their habitats or would defeat the former if pitted against. Four bear species inhabit ‘the old world' ; The sloth bear, Asiatic black bear, Sun bear, and Eurasian Brown bear. The smaller subspecies ; sloth bear, Asiatic black bear and sun bear are often preyed upon by other large predators like tigers, leopards and asiatic wild dog 

An elephant, rhino or hippo would defeat any species of bear one on one, that should be obvious. A large male elephant seal, although they are semi aquatic would defeat any bear just about any time as well. Now to animals who I think aren’t necessarily a lock but are capable of defeating a bear one on one on land. A giraffe is very powerful and has maybe the hardest kick of any animal. Lions can’t bring them down unless the giraffe is small, sick, or they use collective effort. A large saltwater or nile croc could defeat a bear on land if they have a big enough size advantage. Although crocs aren 

This guy:  Yea, that is a Bengal Tiger. You know the African Lion? The “King” of the animal kingdom? Well that guy does not do crap. That guy is like a gigolo putting females to work. But the Tiger? Hunts alone, killed Elephants, and was made to be a vicious killer hunting machine. Sure, the Bear is a heavy duty guy, it can run, it can climb trees, but so can the Tiger. Also not to mention the tiger will ambush him from a top of a tree if needed. The Bear will not. Right, I know what you thinking, the paws of a bear right? Well this guy (the tiger) has great protection. They have been documented killing 

Bison bison (American bison) is disturbed by your question.  It has already given the grizzly a run for its money… literally!  Bison are THE largest terrestrial animals in North America, even more massive than the moose, and moose have already been documented killing grizzlies on a couple ocassions before. And then we got the bison:  Full grown males can be up to 2000 pounds worth of pure muscle, and with a height of 6 feet, it's nothing to be made fun off.  A grizzly trying to face a bull male head on would basically be a death sentence… for the bear. Doubt those claws and teeth would do serious dama 

Sure, but assuming you’re talking about a brown bear and limiting it to North America, then no. An elephant, a rhino, or a hippo would easily be a problem for a brown bear, but short of that no, there’s a reason they’re called mother nature’s killing machines. Someone wrote that a bison would challenge a brown bear; you’ve got to be kidding me. Not even close. The brown bear is like a 900lb rottweiler, but with much sharper claws, much stronger muscles, and it can run 35mph over rough terrain. Shoot it between the eyes with a .45 and the round will just bounce off it’s skull and piss it off. It’ 

What if Ben Nelson was the Hulk in the MCU? How would he fight Thanos?
What if I decided to dress as a bat like Batman and go out at night and fight criminals?
Well, the first thing that occurs to me is that I would fervently hope that you had a lot good medical coverage, ’cause you’re gonna get hurt at some point. No matter how good you might be, injuries ARE going to occur. I’ve spent 40 years practicing martial arts, and when I was younger, entering tournaments, injuries were the norm, even if you thoroughly trounced your opponents. Next, I would hope that you have mastered a variety of martial arts styles. Not just trained for a bit, mind you. Not a year or two of Krav Maga, with BJJ over another year. I’m talking MASTERY. As in, you would dominat 

Most of the answers presuppose that vigilatism is a crime by itself, and, further, that there are not other people who dress up as superheros to fight crime. Both are a resounding no… Here is a website that lists real life superheros fighting crime across the globe. These are real individuals, not a gag site. The Real Life Super Hero Project Further, there are already several “Batmans” out there on the streets fighting crime. Here is a non-exhaustive list. Stephen Lawrence, a Canadian, cavorts around his town searching for evildoers.   (Stephen Lawrence) There is al 

Well first off their is a law about being an actual superhero, so it be kinda hard because of this. Plus You’d have to somehow find the villains. It’d take a lot of hard work needing to learn a few marital arts.  The tech is possible seen may times with the Hacksmith so if the goverment lets you do this then It will be easy. Possibly may have to learn how to build tech or make a company where you guys make this kinda of stuff. Might need to do community service so they can trust you. As well as even call the cops so they know your not one of the bad guys  Yeah th 

To be a superhero, to be a vigilante, is a common fantasy associated with a vulnerability feeling that starts during our childhood and some degree of narcissism, all this normal in we all.So, what if, mentally speaking?Well, first of all, you are gonna be highly disappointed. Batman is the reincarnation of frustration. A spoiled child that had what he wanted, was unable to keep what he cared the most: his parents. And he was present when he lost them. And he did nothing. His straight comes from his rage against himself, as he did nothing (he couldn’t, because he was weak and coward, as he th 

If you’d do that, you’d most likely get killed or seriously injured. However, there are some people that have had the same idea but with a twist. Meet “El Batman Solidario” (the Solidary Batman) from La Plata, Argentina.  This man (his identity is a secret that he refuses to reveal, and asks the same of anyone that knows it) started dressing as Batman 6 years ago to visit the kids at the Sor María Ludovica children’s hospital and give them drawings and color pencils. It grew up from them, by now he receives donations, christmas toys and hosts biannual dinner parties to gather money for the hospita 

I’ve seen one answer about Phoenix Jones doing this in Washington D.C. and there being a law there that says police cannot interfere if a fight is agreed to under a challenge. In the UK, vigilantism would be heavily discouraged. If you want to “dress as a bat like Batman and go out to fight criminals”, the best approach is to do it night and day. And you’d better do it for the right reasons. I have no respect for the Christian Bale Batman, who is about as much a Batman as he is a dark-side started Anakin Skywalker. Adam West Batman was cool about what he did, his style of fighting wasn’t so oct 

You would get shot. Batman is a fictional character. Batman can do the things he does because he’s a fictional character. Any real person attempting to emulate Batman would end up injured, arrested or killed. First off all you’re not the world’s biggest badass. You can’t bench-press 500 pounds. You were not trained by Ninjas. You can’t swap poisoned tea cups in the literal blink of an eye. You can’t beat up an entire room full of badguys at once. Half the things Batman does are straight up physically impossible. Second of you don’t have half of the tech Batman has. Maybe you can find some Bataran 

Well to dress like a bat is one thing but to fight criminals at night is another topic first of all you don’t know who you are fighting so you gotta be careful Batman is someone who studies and trains to defeat even the dangerous of criminals so I suggest you start training to be realistic I suggest you watch videos on Navy Seal or British SAS training to get in your best physical shape and be well trained and aware to know how to be 10 steps ahead of people you could try joining a club near you also I suggest you save up money because you are most likely gonna get stabbed or shot if you are n 

Unless you are a heavily muscled Arnold Schwarzenegger type with circus trapeze acrobat skills… you gonna die!  The lowest level criminals, the muggers, carry weapons like knives and guns. And often work in groups… And unlike the movies they will not attack you one at a time. They will gang up on you, and try to kill you. And unless you can fight off three men at the same time,that equal you in weight, you will be stabbed, shot, or both. And in real life being stabbed will kill you: Dis AIN'T a movie in which you can walk it off. The low level drug dealers WILL run, but the drug lords they work for 

You would be looked at like you're a complete nut. People would laugh at you. They would probably want selfies with you too, because you'd be an amusing novelty. Nobody would take you seriously. And if you did go out and find criminals, and fight them, you'd be arrested. Vigilantism is illegal. You could also be charged with interfering in a police investigation. You could also be charged with obstruction of justice. You could also be charged with impersonating a peace officer. You could also be involuntarily committed to an insane asylum by your family, or the court, or the police or any psychiat 

If all animals were as smart as humans, which species would dominate?
Tardigrade. The tardigrade for the sole reason that they would be most likely to survive the “end of the world.” They have been on the planet for 530 million years and have endured the many changes that the planet has gone through. They can opt to go into cryptobiosis. They can freeze, boil, starve, dehydrate, be exposed to radiation, be deprived of air, and survive the most extreme pressure ranges. They are tiny, and will not go on a power trip to dominate the world. They will simply just wait out the inevitable chaos that would be soon to follow. World War. If the intelligence allows animals to  

Actually, it would probably still be humans. First of all, tool use is, to borrow a term, game-breaking. Animals without body shapes that allow them to make and use tools effectively will not be able to dominate the planet the way humans do. As smart as dolphins are, for example, they aren’t going to be able to make something like a spear. If we’re talking about complex toolmaking, such as flint knapping or tying a rock to a stick to use it as a hammer, there aren’t that many animals that can pull it off. There’s primates, elephants, birds, octopi, and I think that’s pretty much it. Insects mig 

This is a horror scenario. It would be a brutal blood bath for a period while determining dominance. But humans would almost certainly come out on top, because humans have a lot of advantages besides just intelligence that people fail to realize, forget about or discount. Humans are a Great Ape and the greatest threats would come from the other Great Apes. But humans have significantly better fine dexterity, are better able to make and wield tools, are more adaptable to very different environments, have better endurance and capacity for travelling long distances, etc. Yes, especially gorillas, h 

Squirrels. Now hear me out. Guess what the number one cause of power outages in the US is? Squirrels. And that’s by accident. Now imagine a coordinated squirrel attack on all power throughout the world, plus they have knowledge of guerilla war tactics, and how to counter all kinds of attacks by humans. They could take out all our planes and automobiles in hours. The average human isn’t likely to be able to successfully fight a squirrel. Read the comic “Squirrel Girl Beats Up the Marvel Universe”. I know it sounds stupid, but it’s a somewhat realistic apocalypse scenario. They wouldn’t be able to  

If ALL animals were as smart as humans and ALL animals wanted world domination we’d either be dead or enslaved but certainly nowhere near the top of the food chain. Assuming they’re able to observe, learn and understand us including our technology. We’d have to find a means to eradicate or imprison most every one of these intelligent life forms. Since animals by definition comprise of multi cellular organisms of any size I’d say the smaller creatures would present the greatest threat to us. Tiny, microscopic creatures numbering in the billions could permeate our technology rendering it useless. 

From my point of view, I did not expect one to win. But I surely expect one loose - as humans. I expect, that many other species would cooperate to overcome threats. And the biggest one is humanity. We already make a lot of places unhabitable for animals. they would fight back. And more danger would not be those living in the wild. More danger would be those living with us - domesticated animals and pets. They already know a lot about us, and they are so close to us. Against wild (now intelligent) animals, we could build walls, strong fences. But imagine fighting a horde of rats? They find us ve 

Ants. Specifically, fire ants. That’s not specific enough because there are a couple hundred different species of them, but they’ll gang up on humans (as the biggest existential threat to the entire biosphere) before settling things amongst themselves. Humans may have a large starting advantage through current control of most technology, but to ensure continued dominance against ants (and other small things, like spiders) the only option is total destruction of Earth’s biosphere. There are a lot of species that would probably be willing to coexist with humans if they had human intelligence, but an 

 Unfortunately, i think Ants is going to rule the world. To think human will continue ruling the world would be silly. Food source Your chicken, your fish, your cows etc are all smart now. They are not going to behave in such “peaceful” manner. They will retaliate and attack humans if they know and they will know we are going to eat them. They will not just gather around peacefully and will try to escape any confinement. Fish will not swim at “dangerous” spots. They will not bite the baits any more. They might even figure out how to cut those nets that fisherman use to catch them, perhaps with the  

We would. Humans would get demolished by almost every species that we encounter in the wild when we possess no weapons, but now that they have our intelligence, what holds us back from getting replaced by chimpanzees or apes? These.  Most animals will be completely unable to build anything, only chimpanzees, and other primates will have this ability. Even with our intelligence, they would start off with no language, no knowledge of gunpowder, guns, or any advanced tool used to cut and kill. Let us say all animals are granted human intelligence by some omnipotent being, but because most other animals 

In order to answer this question we first need to understand how exactly our intelligence got us to the place we have now in the world. The development of technology seems like an obvious answer so let’s take a deeper look into this first, because any species that’s not developing advanced technology will hardly stand a chance in this war for dominance unless they have other extremely huge advantages that somehow complement with their newly gained intelligence. A wrong assumption that is often made is that to develop technology you only need intelligence. This is wrong. In order to develop techn 

Who would win if all the Disney princesses fought, Hunger Games style?
Do you want to be exactly as they are in their stories? If so that seems a bit dull. If we exclude Elsa and Moana, it's kinda obvious who'll win, since there are only two who actually know how to use a real weapon. So since there are already many different answers about who would win in their respective universes, allow me to ask the question: What if the princesses lived in the hunger games universe? Yep. There we go. So allow me to create, for you, essentially a fanfiction. Ah… The lows I sink to for my audiences enjoyment… Oh, and there will be no Moana or Elsa. Ocean friends and ice powers are  

For those unaware, before I begin I’ll tell the readers who the official Disney Princesses are;  CinderellaSnow WhiteAuroraArielBelleJasminePocahontasMulanTianaRapunzelMeridaSome may be wondering where other Disney Princesses like Elsa, Anna, Fiona, and Moana are, but they have not yet officially joined the ranks of the Disney Princesses as of December 2016. I will split this up into three sections: The No-Chances (11–10–9)The High Possibilities (8–7-6–5)The Final Rounders (4–3–2–1)11: Aurora Film: Sleeping BeautyPrince: Prince PhilipEnemy: MaleficentEncourages people to “always wonder” Yes, the sl 

Interesting if these 10 Disney Princesses are going to play in the game together. I made this chart to mark their force value, skills, weapons, and their weakness in the team. Yep in my imagination, they would all meet together and finally form a Disney Team so that we could see another league of the princess! Exciting! Then I will describe the game with the help of my chart. And for a better exploring, I share this link of my chart here: Disney Princess-GitMind Here goes with princess Ariel, Elle, Aurora, and Cinderella.  ArielAriel has a good voice and singing is her weapon. She is so sensitive 

There are many ways this can go down – I’ll describe two scenarios. One is the canonical everyone-breaks-character brawl. The other one is … well, a bit edgier.    (from the TV show "Drawn Together"). Note, I am not condoning the following acts of violence, or suggesting that they lie within the capacity of Disney Princesses. Scenario 1: “Let’s play a game” 13 princesses (Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, Ariel, Bell, Jasmine, Pocahontas, Mulan, Tiana, Rapunzel, Merida, Ana, Elsa) wake up in a large circular room.  There is one door, and it is locked and barricaded from the outside. Scattered abou 

Darkness fell upon the forest glen as she sat quietly listening. The grass rustled with the wind, and the leaves shook gently. She didn't move, she couldn't. She'd heard the sound of others dying, and even some of her closest friends had fallen. Ariel, Cinderella, and Anna were among the first to fall, sending Elsa on a rage that felled many more. Now she was one of the last to survive. It wasn't skill or luck that kept her alive, well maybe it was luck. She didn't ask to be born this way. Suddenly movement broke through her thoughts. Behind me! She spun and fired, even though nothing was there 

I will assume that all contenders are using their powers as intelligently as possible and intend to subdue their opponents as pragmatically as possible. Given the above statement, I believe that Elsa would win a great majority of the time. The evidence: The winter of Arendelle. In 39 seconds, Elsa freezes the entirety of Arendelle - which includes a massive body of water - and causes the air temperature to drop so low that it begins snowing. Frozen - Elsa Runs Away. Additionally, Elsa shows no signs of fatigue from performing this act, and is able to reverse this massive heat transfer in mere min

Elsa may be the only Disney Princess with a super hero power that is aggressive. But most of the writers haven't considered the real Hunger games in the books. In the books , it's supposed to be entertaining and requiring lot of action. They need to last and entertain the people. We often see the Game makers trying to force the tributes to go head on by activating dangerous waves of insects or natural disasters. So I believe they would do something to control Elsa's power rendering them useless. The Hunger games hasn't had a character with super powers , so it would be a bit of confusion. But I' 

So all Disney pricesses? First, we gotta define it: The Disney Princess is a franchise comprised of twelve Official Princesses and a number of associated heroines. These are them:  No one else but them, and only them count for different reasons. (Elsa and her sister were so successful that Frozen became a separated franchise and don’t form part of the oficial Disney Princesses franchise, some others might not count by virtue of not been human like Nala of the Lion King, or might not be because their movie was not as successful, or because they don’t have an original Disney movie, etc…) So, according  

Apparently, these are the “Canon” Disney Princesses: CinderellaSnow WhiteAuroraArielBelleJasminePocahontasMulanTianaRapunzelMeridaNow, as for the rules of the Hunger Games, as I understand them from the films I saw: #1. The contestants are to fight to the death when the bell sounds. Weapons are provided for each of them. #2. Before the match, contestants are required to show off their skills and cause a stir in the media in order to attract sponsors (sort of like a deadly “American Idol”). #3. There can be only one champion (This rule was broken by Katnip). Part One: Sponsorship The Princesses are b

The area surrounding Lake Karachay in the Russian Federation is one of the most hazardous places on this planet. The lake is situated right next to the Mayak nuclear facility, which was built during the 1940s and delivered the plutonium for the Soviet Unions first nuclear weapon. The existence of this place was kept a secret up until the 1990s.  This is a picture from the Mayak facility and gives a general idea of how the place looks. The site suffered many accidents during its existence, most notably the one which occurred on the 29th of September 1957, called the “Kystym disaster”. Surprisingly

The last region on Earth to be explored, this large continent is not divided into countries, but seven nations claimed territories there. In 1959, however, the Antarctic treaty suspended those claims and stated that the continent is to be used for peaceful purposes only, Antarctica sole inhabitants are visiting scientists, working in research stations.

How about a place on Earth so inhospitable that not only can’t humans survive there, but even microbial life appears to have given it a miss: the Atacama Desert in South America.  This region of the world is so arid that some areas go centuries without seeing any appreciable precipitation. This is due to the fact that the Atacama is blockaded from receiving rainfall by both the Andes and coastal mountain ranges. But even along the coast, the Atacama area is so dry that ancient people were able to practice mummification thousands of years before the Egyptians. The Atacama is the driest region of  

One of the most inhospitable places on the planet is this place...  It's so inhospitable that there is no life here. There are no plants of any kind, let alone trees, because plants simply can't survive here, even though it does rain here at least once a month. There are no insects or animals of any kind either. Even scorpions and cockroaches can't survive here. This place is literally devoid of life and it has nothing to do with the influence of man, it’s because this place is naturally devoid of life. Nothing can survive here. If you were to suddenly find yourself in the middle of this place with 

Can you live in a place dubbed “the most bombed place on Earth”? Never ever. This desert land in Nevada has been a victim of more than 900 nuclear detonation at the hands of US Government. It is a barren wasteland with extremely high radiation (above and below ground level).  The Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) is located among 1,300 square miles of desert in the American Southwest. Formerly known as the Nevada Proving Grounds, the site was established on 11 January 1951 for the testing of nuclear devices.

 Lake Natron is a soda lake in Tanzania known for its incredibly alkaline state (pH of 10.5) and red water. The water can reach scorching temperatures of up to 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit); those that enter will experience intense burns. The only animal that can survive this lake is the flamingos, which inhabit the area and have developed skin durable to the heat. Another fascinating fact about this lake is that due to the sodium carbonate in the water, when an animal dies here, its body will become calcified, essentially mummifying it.

Pripyat, Ukraine: Disaster struck at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power plant on 26 April 1988, One of the reactors completely melted down. It contaminated the environment to such an extent that the area won't be safe for human habitation for at least 20,000 years. This is a photo of the melted reactor core. It is commonly referred to as “the elephant’s foot” The radiation levels are so high that even now, 30 years later, spending just 300 seconds in it’s presence will result in certain death.  At the scene of the Chernobyl disaster, the radiation blasts were so high that a fatal dose could be delivered  

Ilha da Queimada Grande Generally known as Snake Island, the island is loaded up with the amazingly venomous brilliant lancehead pit snake with one snake for every square meter.  Snake Island was once part of the Brazilian terrain until it was disconnected from the landmass 11,000 years back because of rising ocean levels. The rising waters caught the snakes on the island when it concealed the land that associated it to the terrain. The incredibly venomous and fundamentally imperiled brilliant lanceheads prospered quickly on the island since there were no ground-level predators on the island. Rese

If humans suddenly disappeared, what would happen to our planet?
After just one day, the entire planet would be plunged into darkness. Most fossil fuel power stations would shut down, causing cascading blackouts worldwide, once they ran out of fuel. Solar panels and wind turbines would still be able to generate electricity in some areas of the planet, but eventually, they would stop working after a few months or a couple of years.  Nuclear power plants around the world would shut down and enter an automatic safe mode so as to prevent a possible meltdown of the nuclear reactor, without people to use the energy that these power plants make.  Also, no power means t 

This scenario seems impossible, but over the past thousand years, humans have faced numerous events that have threatened huge portions of the human population, such as the Black Death in the 14th century, which killed nearly 70% of Europe’s population, or the influenza pandemic in the early 1900’s that affected 75 million people worldwide. However, what if humans just disappeared suddenly – not due to some pandemic. Let’s look at the definite consequences one at a time.

My personal opinion is that it will become a far better environment. After all according to current statistics we are in danger of killing our planet off slowly but surely. I firmly believe that if all humans disappeared, this would be the opportunity the aliens from Planet Sky have been waiting for.  They will descend on earth with their myriad of spacecrafts and superior knowledge and visions, and get down to getting things in order. The first thing they will take into account is climate change and global warming because we humans definitely have not done an awfully good job in this respect. The 

Our planet is 4.5 billion years old, life is said to have come in to existence about 4.1 billion years ago (evidence found in 2015, remains of biotic life from 4.1 billion years ago in ancient rocks in western australia), however humans came in to existence some 250k years ago! A logical outcome here is that life existed and flourished in the world even before humans came in to existence, for example dinosaurs lived on earth for 160 million years, can you imagine? It was only due to some natural catastrophe that they became extinct. Now what shall happen if humans suddenly disappear? Ecological s

With no humans to operate them and take care of them, the power plants will shut down, eventually shutting down the power on Earth.

Well, when everybody is thinking about the positive changes on our planet and that is we wish should happen, I would speculate the negative effects that could change our planet if humans suddenly disappear.  At that second, chaos will begin. Cars, aeroplanes, trains, LPG cylinders, ships, controlled processes in factories would crash and explode causing wild fires. Human indulgence could only stop these but sorry we are extinct. Eventually, it will be the scenario all over the world, each city and production sites. Until these small fires (yes small compared to what is coming next) spread to gas

Can somebody please show me the Earth’s curvature without a fish eye lens?
Hi, Take a look at this a moment, and give it some thought. This is an image of a 17th Century Globe made some 300 years before space travel was even thought of.   Don’t you find it suspicious and uncanny that it looks exactly like the one that is depicted by “ The Blue Marble “ or any picture that you have seen of our earth. Not only that but it is portrayed with the Mercator map, which we know if the earth is a globe then it’s the wrong map ! It should be this map…This map is a true representation of our earth if it is a globe, which I believe it is not. You never see this on pictures of N.A.S.A.

Fun Fact: no one directly sees the Earth’s curvature from the Earth, certainly not at sea level. I’d like to know your thinking for including the fish eye lens. Everything looks curved through FEL, so it would be impossible to detect the curvature of anything looking at an image taken through that lens. BUT it’s a good example, because you KNOW the curves in Fish Eye pics is optical distortion right? Not real. That skill, figuring out what’s optics or an illusion and what’s real, you need before you can see the curvature of Earth. Like parallel lines of a railway track way into the distance appe 

Actually you have to travel far away enough from the surface to see a curvature. Unless you are very far away and able to see an entire hemisphere (like Apollo astronauts did) you can only see a smaller part of the Earth surface. What you see from satellites in orbit such as the ISS is a curved horizon. The horizon is actually a circle which is flat. But the part of Eath visible within the circle is not flat, it is bulging in the middle as it would in a sphere where you cut a segment through it like this.  But there quite a few ways to confirm there is a curvature without a “fish eye” lense whic 

First, all lenses are fish-eyes if you know the math. What we call a fish-eye is just really really short, and you notice the spherical aberration. What is called a non-fisheye lens is just one that is clever in hiding the fact it really is. I want to take the opposite tact to show the curvature of the earth without pictures by proposing that the most likely shape of the earth is “round(ish)”. And I want too prove that not only is the Earth curved, but a fish-eye lens proves the universe is curved, and if you follow its logic, eventually you will arrive at a universe with likely thirteen dimens

Why can't we see the earth spinning?
Very simple to understand: because you’re set on the same reference, a huge reference by the way, then you can’t observe any relative motion from Earth within the Earth. Let’s think about examples you may know: If you’re set inside of your automobile and it runs at a certain speed you are at the same speed. Likewise you look at the dash board, at the seats, but you don’t see your car movinging. However, you know it’s moving because you have a bunch of references you see moving against you through the 

For the same reason that you can’t see the minute hand on a wrist watch move. It is too slow (but only barely so) for human perception. On a large enough clock, if you get up close, you can see the minute hand move. (Find one that has sweep motion, not stop and go. I still miss the old “sweep” second hand I once had on my wrist; yes, I know it actually consisted of a large number of tiny steps, but it appeared as a continuous motion to me.) Take a ride on a Merry-Go-Round. You can sense that it is spinning. But slow it back a factor of 60, and your body won’t sense that. A scientist sees evidenc 

Because you are on earth itself. So you need to see any stationary object outside Earth to infer it. Like if you are in train, you see stationary object going backward. Here I shot star trails by stacking 85 images taken over 1 hour and 20 min.  Star Trails by Canon SX40 HS See, star in center didn't form trail. Because it's Polar Star and earth axis is aligned with it. All other stars moved either closer or further to Polar Star in image, they exactly moved to a certain angle. Let's do math. Since earth takes 24 hours in one rotation that's means 360/24 = 15° rotation in an hour and above picture  

But we can with not too much practice. The best opportunity is watch the Moon rise (evening) or set (morning) within a day or two of the full moon. This is on the opposite side of the sky from Sun, so the Sun is least distracting then. The Moon is approximately 1/2 a degree in diameter. (changes slight with distance from Earth and doesnt matter for this argument.) The full sky, including the half under the Earth is 360 degrees. So the Moon’s disk covers about 1/720 of the sky. There are 1440 minutes in a day. So a good rule of thumb is the sky moves the diameter of the Moon in about two minutes. 

You CAN see the earth spin. I see it regularly. However, to be honest, witnessing the earth turning does require two things: You must (1) put down your phone, and (2) go outside… at night! Grab a couple of beers. You’ll be there a while. Maybe order a pizza? Situate yourself under the starry sky on a moonlit evening. Position a chair or other sitting device such that from your view the moon intersects the upper branches of a tall tree (“trees” are things you will encounter if you go “outside”). A phone pole or high-tension tower will also work, although they are decidedly unromantic and will no 

Uhm, you can? You know that gigantic ball of constant thermonuclear combustion that “travels across the sky” each day? That’s actually earth rotating. About every 24 hours, it completes a full rotation, hence a day being 24 hours. Relative to the earth, the sun is in a pretty constant location. its a little weird to think about, but quite simple too. Notice that the sun appears to be in a different place in the sky than at sunset. Earth’s rotation!! That one isn’t believable enough for you? Okay. How about stars. Note that each year, we will see the same stars. We see different parts of the night s 

You see it everyday. The sun and moon rises and sets. This is due to the rotation of the Earth. We don't perceive it spinning because we don't have a good background or frame relative to which we could observe the earth spinning. If there was, we would have already observed it as the parallax change would be a lot higher, like in the observations of sun and moon or in a travelling train (background being the nice surroundings). If your train was inside a tunnel with no change in the walls/background it would seem the train is stationary (ignoring the effects of motion). Add to it the fact that  

Let's put it in different manner: It all comes down to relative motion between the earth and us. It’s because Earth spins steadily – and moves at a constant rate in orbit around the sun – carrying you as a passenger right along with it. Think about riding in a car or flying in a plane. As long as the ride is going smoothly, you can almost convince yourself you’re not moving. A jumbo jet flies at about 500 miles per hour (about 800 km per hour), or about half as fast as the Earth spins at its equator. But, while you’re riding on that jet, if you close your eyes, you don’t feel like you’re moving  

But we actually can. Especially when it is not too cloudy. Manual on how to easily see the Earth spinning Wherever you are, just find out what is the current sunrise or sunset time at your location. It is very easy to find out, there are numerous websites, or you can simply Google it on your smartphone, and it will be shown right on top of search results. Like this:  Then, determine where is West and East. Again, if you have a smartphone, this is pretty easy to do. Everything else then pretty much depends on whether you are a morning or an evening person. If you are okay with waking up early, look  

You have to understand the fact that you won't be able to see any motion until and unless you see anything relative to it. Assume You're moving in space with nothing around. Utter space. No stars, no asteroids, no planets, Nothing but just black and then your motion even at light speed will be nothing. You won't sense it because there's nothing relative to it against which you can sense it's motion. You'd feel like you're at rest even if you're in motion. You'll see your spaceship at rest relative to you(obliviously) and your spaceship at rest relative to nothingness around. So grab the first fa 

If Earth was the size of Jupiter, would the entire planet have been explored by 2018?
Assuming the enlargement does not affect gravity, envirronement, biological life … If Earth was as big as Jupiter, every distance would be 10 times larger and every surface would be 100 times larger. To put things into perspective, Jovian Earth would be really big. A flight between London and New York would be a 60,000-kilometre journey, which is more than the circumference of Earth (40,000 km). The Jovian USA would have twice the surface of actual Earth. So how would these ridiculously big figures impact the development of Jovian mankind? Remember that Jovians are just regular human beings.  On act 

I’m assuming: Equivalent sentient bipedal beings, human sized, starting at the same time about 2 million years ago, and evolved at the same rate. (Questions of whether the size of the planet would affect evolution are out of scope of my answer.)Equivalent geography and weather, just 120 times the area of Earth.Earth was completely occupied 12,000 years ago, approximately, when homo sapiens made it to the Western Hemisphere. Several waves of pre-sapiens (homo something-else) had already populated the rest of the planet, except for uninhabitable Antarctica (as far as we know). Sailing vessels visi 

The Earth would be say 1000x as heavy. Gravity would be 10x stronger (scaling with mass/radius squared). Lifeforms, including humans, in order not to collapse under their own weight (pressure scaling with gravity x length cubed / length squared), would be 10x shorter, so we could hope to be about 18 cm tall. Orbital velocity would be 10x higher, so 78 km/s (square root of mass / radius). We would cool down 10x more quickly, so our metabolic rate has to be 10x higher to stay warm. We'd be spending 10x more time finding and putting 10x more food per body weight into our tiny mouths, about our bo 

Assuming that people could live on a planet that size… It’s difficult to just expand the time based on the size. On Earth, a lot of the time exploration stalled when there was nothing accessible left to explore, and then it had to wait until new technology came along (eg ocean-going ships or aircraft) making a new ‘burst’ of exploration possible. If the planet was a lot bigger, then there wouldn’t be these enforced pauses as much. So, on Earth, for instance, there was a huge pause in exploration after people had walked everywhere they could walk (or use small boats), before ocean-going ships wer 

Our notions of planetary formation say that no rocky planet could get that big - it would pull in gas and become a Gas Giant. But it might manage, if it were much less dense and if something else removed the gas. Maybe a series of collisions by rocky planets after the gas was used up. Humans - most notably Polynesians - had reached almost all habitable land with simple vessels. Ending with New Zealand about 1280. But Europeans were the first to map the entire globe. The first to travel freely right round it. James Cook in the third quarter of the 18th century filled in most of the unknown spots,  

Almost certainly not. Why? We have not explored the entire planet Earth at its current size. The seas contain many mysteries as do all the continents and the Arctic ice cap. Any real depth below the Earth’s surface remains in part a mystery.But no need to go so far afield. I can take a day trip from where I live (Pacific Northwest) and with near certainty and a bit of hiking step on places where no human foot has ever trodden.We humans are a big deal—to ourselves and in proportion of impact on Earth compared to other species and our ability to hack evolution through understanding and manipulation 

So you really want to know. We can look at it in many ways. As you all know Jupiter is a gas giant and is the biggest planet in our solar system. It is 11 times the size of earth. Obviously you can imagine from here that there would be so much land for us. Imagine every country getting bigger 11 times. But I will not go into this. I am a doctor so lets talk about how it will affect our health. The gravitational force of earth would multiply some 11 times and it would life very very difficult to move around or jump. This much gravity will cause some serious injuries. We are multiplying our weight  

If Earth was the size of Jupiter, made of the same materials and density as Earth, it would have been a high gravity Super-Earth made of a massive iron core, with a dense atmosphere made primarily of hydrogen. (The massive gravity will prevent the solar wind from blowing away some of the original hydrogen-helium atmosphere that early Earth had during the formation of the Solar System.) That Jupiter-Earth will likely be barren of intelligent life.   To calculate by how much Jupiter-Earth’s gravity will be stronger than Earth’s:  Radius 69,911 vs. 6,371 -&gt; i.e. 10.97 bigger radius. Volume 1.4313×10^15  

If the Earth was the size of Jupiter but with a gravitation of still 1g then I suppose the “Hollow Earth” theory would be a certainty. In this case, I further theorize that some inner parts of the crust would also be occupied. Exploring all these places would be a formidable task so I believe one wouldn’t need to go to countries like Marshal Islands, in order to “disappear”. I just gave everybody reading this, the ideas of at least 10 sci-fi full length movies. Good Luck!

I would say no, Human civilization started advancing exponentially only in the last 200 years and I would argue that a big part of it is that we ‘filled’ the planet. Once every place was occupied and countries (as large scale stable entities) were established, global commerce started a flow of ideas and goods that kickstarted what we are living today. So in a planet with 100 times the surface of earth (all other parameters being the same) I would expect us to still be in the stone age. 295 views · View upvotes2Morgan FitzPatrick Andrews, I am drawn to astronomy by a fear of the planet Saturn.Answered 1 year ago · Author has 140 answers and 29.2K answer views

What is Earth's human carrying capacity?
About 3,500,000,000 (3.5 bilion). That’s the max population WITHOUT exhausting all Earth’s resources, eroding all ecosystems, killing and cornering almost all animal species to extintion, so on and more so on…. Yeah, I’m aware that these days Earth’s population is about 7.8 - 7.9 billions, but…, how’s Earth? Eroded? Exhausted? Unhabitable in –how much you like? 10%?, 15%? (just think Chernobyl and many areas in Fukushima). How many species have gone extint since 1970? How much of natural forest we (as mankind) been lost (Mexico, around 90%, but we must take into account USA, Brasil and the Amaz 

Undeniably, the Earth does have a carrying capacity. To answer your question simply, with the population's current growth rate we would hypothetically have over 10 billion people on Earth by 2050. However, the UN estimates we will peak around 8 billion people in 2041 and then decline. Therefore, the most widely accepted estimate for human carrying capacity of Earth is around 8 billion people (at current consumption rates). To put that in perspective, the latest official current world population estimate, for mid-year 2010, is estimated at 6,852,472,823 (about.com).  Further explanation: Ecologis 

We're way beyond that now. There’s a precise demographic term for people who deny overpopulation is a problem: Idiots. Sure, we might technically cram 100 billion people onto the planet, and even feed them. Why, when we can keep our numbers to a safe and sustainable level? Okay, you want maximum occupancy? Be willing to live in one of these places.    Now in order to feed 100 billion people, kiss the natural world goodbye. We’re already using 25% of the earth’s primary productivity as it is. Since you don’t thing the ecosphere is necessary, you will, of course, not go on vacation. It’ll be “staycat 

The answer to this question is based entirely on the availability of low cost energy. What has allowed the huge growth in population and technology over the last 100 or so years is the availability of cheap energy , fossil fuels in prodigious quantities. This has also lead to increased wealth which has enabled states all around the world to lift many people out of poverty and degradation. Nothing in all of man’s history has basically a single resource had such an effect on living standards globally . Nobody can deny this , every “luxury” or comfort in the vast majority of peoples lives around t 

The definition that Cory quoted is good. However, he, and as far as I can tell almost all scientists that have contributed to wikipedia/overpopulation article, have failed to comprehend that definition. His numbers totally ignore a fundamental requirement of the definition sustainability. Burning oil, coal, natural gas, uranium, is permanent damage. Most see the burning of fossil fuels as permanent damage only because of the carbon dioxide that is produced, but that is a mistake. It is permanent damage simply because the oil, an asset, is being eliminated. You would not say that a corporation  

(Guys, I just translated the answer, if you disagree and want to debate, talk to the original author, because I am not!) Many people are disgusted to know this, but... If we made a gigantic condominium, with luxury buildings with twenty-two floors, six apartments per floor and give an apartment to EVERY PERSON. The entire population of planet Earth could be comfortably accommodated in the state of Sergipe; for Americans, substitute “New Jersey” for “Sergipe”. Of course, we take into account a hypothetical efficient allocation of resources. To really have a problem, we would need to exceed 100 bill 

It’s a matter of how you want to live, but the fortunate thing is, we won’t need to find out. Virtually no one thinks there will ever be 11 billion humans. Most population biologists think we will peak at 10 to 10.5 billion, some time around the middle of this century, and then slowly decline. How far is a matter of conjecture, but maybe by as much as 50% over the next century, and then stay roughly there. Why? Simple. Educated women and birth control. Since basically forever, tribes and religions told women to shut the fuck up, stay home, obey their husbands, stay barefoot, and have lots of kids 

There are over 7 billion people on Earth. Nobody knows for sure the maximum number of people the Earth could support. Some say 10 billion but that is only an estimate and does not take into account of the possibility of somebody discovering/inventing a way to grow a lot more food using the same quantity of land. The problem is not the lack of space to hold people, but the lack of arable land needed to feed them. The problem is not insurmountable. The key is to use the land more efficiently so that you get more food from the same amount of land. Reducing waste is an important part of the solutio 

Carrying capacity for any organism depends upon a number of different factors and tends to fluctuate a little bit. Resources like food, water, essential nutrients, shelter, and medical care, all affect the human population. Let's use food and water as an example. If there is enough food for 100 people and enough water for 150 people, then the carrying capacity is 100 people. If the population grows to more than 100 people, there isn't enough food for all of them. People will starve to death, thus reducing the population to carrying capacity or under it. The problem with the human carrying capac 

There’s no specific number. Any kind of an assumption would be pointless to make right now. The Earth is expected to have over 9 billion people by 2050, and even cross 11 billion by the end of this century. But we can’t say for sure whether 9 billion people or 11 billion people will be sustained by the Earth’s resources; simply because we haven’t faced it before. Overpopulation is one of those hypothetical scenarios in which assumptions can seldom be made. All we can do is take precautionary measures which may or may not help us in the future.

Did we know the shape of the continents before satellites?
Did we know the shape of the continents before satellites? Here’s a 1950 map of Earth, 7 years before Sputnik launched:  Here’s a 1900AD map of Earth, 57 years before Sputnik:  And a 1900 globe projection of Earth:  And an 1850 map of Earth. It’s getting a bit rougher at the north and south poles, which were barely explored at the time.  An 1852 map:  A 1798 map of the world: not much worse than 1850.  By 1750, there were some real blanks at the far edges of the world from Europe:  1700 map - not much worse than 1750, allowing for the limits of the projection.  1630 map - missing a certain land down under:  1570 

Yes, people do know the shape of continents before the existence of satellites. Here’s one of the evidence: This is a Ptolemy’s Map made by Claudius Ptolemaus, whom known as the Father of Geography. This map known to Hellenistic society in the 2nd century. It is based on the description contained in Ptolemy's book “Geography”, writtenon c. 150.  Ptolemy was able to create cylindrical maps based on his knowledge of a spherical earth. They also use astronomy and geometry to calculate latitude and longitude Ptolemy was also able to draw on some accurate calculations of the size of the Earth, including 

We did. Satellites simply confirmed what humans brilliantly figured out prior to the existence of satellites. The 16th century “Age of Discovery”, when ships from Europe fanned out across the globe, was also the age of navigation. Navigation required math. Math required brains. “Necessity is the mother of invention” is the proven axiom in this case. As these great navigators sailed they charted their courses. The act of charting their courses required a system. The system of longitudes and latitudes was the outcome. Of course, Pythagorus had to prove that the earth was a sphere in the first pl 

“Did we know the shape of the continents before satellites?” you ask…most assuredly we did. How about this world map from around 1860.  Before the advent of orbiting satellites we had aerial photogrammetry which was performed using balloons, aircraft, and even suborbital rockets. This technique involved taking multiple images of an area and comparing them to extract 2D and also 3D information. Photogrammetry – Aerial Photography and Procedure in Surveying However long before that technology became available we had pretty good notions of the extent of continents and countries via surveying. In thi 

Maps began getting more accurate with the development of the seagoing clock as strange as that sounds. Prior to that, a location’s latitude could be accurately figured. Take a sextant sight of the sun at local noon — when the sun is exactly due south. Then, knowing the sun’s declination, how man degrees north or south of the equator for the particular time of year, you could figure the your latitude, the latitude of the location you wanted to determine it. Or you could take a sextant sight of the North Star, Polaris. It is almost directly over the North Pole with a declination of 89º 15′ 50.8″ 

Did we know the shape of the continents before satellites? Yes. Maps were good 100 years before the first satellite went into orbit. Maps were excellent 50 years before satellites were launched. Modern surveying methods match pre-satellite maps to within a few feet in most places. The biggest changes came with redefining the Earth’s mathematically-described shape (The latest revision of the geoid is WGS 84 in 1984, last revised in 2004) The topography changed very little, but the coordinates of fixed objects changed. I remember when we had to work full-time for months to recalculate millions of oi 

Absolutely. We didn't start out traveling in "fake" NASA spacecraft, you know. First we had boats! We've had boats and compasses for centuries, which means we could follow a coastline pretty accurately, and we could draw it on a map with reasonable certainty. And then every time we made a map, we could check it, yeah? We could make a better map from our first attempt, and then a better one from that. So the maps got better and better for CENTURIES. We have known the shape of the Earth for a long, long, LONG, time. Satellites and other spacecraft pretty much just confirmed what we already knew. 559 views · View upvotes103Paul Nance, still a student of the sciencesAnswered 1 year ago · Author has 6.1K answers and 2.6M answer views

Q: Did we know the shape of the continents before satellites? For hundreds of years, men in ships sailed the oceans, they had sextants which allowed them to find their latitudes, and in the 1800’s reliable marine clocks enabled the determination of longitude. Collecting this data about the shores of the oceans have enabled very reliable maps long before satellites. Even prior to the days of instrumentation, the maps produced were fairly accurate.  Just depends on how many ships had actually sailed in those areas. 436 views · View upvotes · Answer requested by Dexter Roona411Luke Hince, BA Business Studies, Coventry University (2021)Answered 11 months ago · Author has 105 answers and 33.7K answer views

Yes. On record the oldest map is a Babylonian world map, known as the Imago Mundi, which is commonly dated to the 6th century BCE. This map shows some continents from what remanins but their shapes dont really resemble what we know contintents look like today.  Over time as explorers, and catographers went around the world they mapped the world with more detail, getting the shape of continents more accurate. To answer your question we know the first image from space was in 1946.  However we knew the world map shapes well before then. We can look at Samuel Dunn's map of the world (1794), over 2300 y 

Yes. Cartographers have developed better maps of the world over the centuries. A system of latitude and longitude was originated by the ancient Greeks that allowed any point on the Earth to be described mathematically. It has long been known how to determine latitude by measuring the angle of the Sun from the horizon at noon, or the angle of a known star at night, but a great breakthrough came in the late 18th Century when methods were developed to determine longitude from the angular separation between the Moon and another celestial body, or using the new, accurate marine clock.  312 views · View upvotes5Srinivasan Radhakrishnan, Finance Controller ICS Finance, "Top Writer 2018" at NTT Data (2013-present)Answered 9 months ago · Author has 719 answers and 3M answer views

What are the things no one tells you about living alone?
If you don’t have a pet, it’s quite lonely. Even a cat sleeping under the bed is more comforting than an empty house. It drags you down. If you drop something on the ground, it will stay there for 30 years unless you pick it up and put it away or throw it away. The only person you have to satisfy is yourself. Everything you do is good enough, if it’s good enough for you. You get used to seeing the same things day in and day out and as a result you don’t see things that are worn, dirty or out of date. Get a good friend to point these out to you. The number one thing you will miss but that everyone 

I moved out to London five months ago. Until then, I’d shared a bathroom and sometimes a bedroom for 18 years. This is more of a what no one tells you about living alone for the first time. You can poop with the door open. You can literally put your laptop outside the door, put on Netflix and watch Brooklyn 99 on the toilet. Heck, you could seat there and watch an entire episode, and no-one will know about it (unless you put it on Quora, obviously).Being financially independent is…terrifying. For example, you can spend £150 on a new tattoo and then eat powdered mac &amp; cheese from Poundland until

How truly liberating and amazing it is. This can be different for those who get lonely, I don’t. It is truly surreal not having anyone to call your name, just being able to relax and do what you want whenever you want. No one is pestering you. You only have you to cook for. It’s great. You can have company when you want and not have any when you don’t want. Meditation is a synch. I absolutely love it. I won’t be able to live alone again for many many years as I have children now and they are small. But believe me I can not wait until the day. The children I don’t actually mind.

Why would anyone tell you anything? Nobody did when I was forced to live alone, but then again I didn’t know anyone who lived alone. There are things about living alone that came as a surprise to me and shall list them here. I was shocked at how expensive living alone is! Having nobody to do the tasks that my late husband used to do and that I can’t do means that I have to pay people to do them for me. I don’t have any family so I can’t get help there. I just have to pay up. Weekends, public holiday times and traditionally family times are especially tough when you live alone especially when you  

Here are some things I have noticed from the perspective of living alone after becoming an empty-nester followed not long after by the death of my wife: - You get used to your own company After almost thirty hectic years of family life I now only have myself to think about.

Living alone increases your productivity. If you work from home, have a side hustle, or have any kind of hobby then you’re gonna be a lot more productive living by yourself. For me, my productivity almost tripled after living alone. The amount of time wasted working around the house is going to be cut significantly when you live alone. I did my laundry in two loads once every two weeks, and on most days I had only one cup and one plate in the sink so doing the dishes was never a burden. Anytime can be a good time for a nap.

The things that no one tells you about living alone are huge. For starters, when adults between the ages of 40–60 live alone, they are regarded as social freaks. Because, you know, it’s abnormal for healthy adults to want to live alone. Some of us live alone because we lost a significant other and either can’t or won’t move on. Others, like myself, had to go through a lot of self inflicted torment early on in adult life. I didn’t want to have a normal life, and let me tell you, I didn’t. My parents were unfortunately not good role models for marriage, or divorce, but that’s another story. Cons

Why is it that intelligent people tend to feel lonely most of the time?
I think this is a great question and one I have thought about a lot. There definitely is a correlation between high levels of intelligence and solitude, sadness/depression, and difficulty connecting with other people. I think there are various factors that could explain different cases of intelligent people being lonely, but most of them boil down to the types of personalities and disposition that go along with a person of exceptional intelligence. In a lot of ways, people who are highly intelligent can live inside their own bubbles, basically needing their own insular space carved out for the 

 Intelligent people often know more than less intelligent people. They know more about their own beliefs, they dictate their own logic and have a better grasp on their life, at least most of the time. Most of the time they reason their problems away or get to a pretty accurate actionable step sooner than others. All of this makes it very difficult to do the one thing they need to do to be less lonely: Trust others. Intelligent people were often smart enough to make it through their life on their own thus far and every time they have trusted people, they were met with disappointment. The other people 

It is not the intelligent people, but usually the SELFISH,GREEDY, ARROGANT, EGOISTIC, AND STINGY PEOPLE who end up being lonely in life. If we are not willing to share our time, energy, wisdom and money with others, we might feel isolated. Poor people are rarely alone. They convert their misery into blessing and joy by sharing the same with one another. On the other hand wealthy or greedy (greedy are not always rich but they love money anyway) convert the blessing into misery by remaining aloof. A growing body of findings also suggests that “those with fewer resources attend more to the needs of  

Wow! A lot of very interesting and detailed answers here! I’ll put in some of my thoughts: Intelligence is not highly regarded in America. Being male and highly intelligent puts me at a severe disadvantage in dating and the mating game. To win as a male here you need to be rich and/or handsome. And not be too intelligent as a mate will look at this as a gulf and not an opportunity to build a bridge and/or come up to speed.Females being highly intelligent appear to me to have a very significant problem. My daughter was (still is) quite a knockout beauty but she told me that she had to dumber her

Not all intelligent people end up being lonely. In fact I would say that the majority are not lonely, as they gravitate towards other intelligent people and tend to develop relationships that are rewarding. But you have to be living and working within a place or structure that gives you exosure to these people in the first place. I do not, am not currently working in a place where there are higher level intelligent people or culturally experienced and as such am very much alone. But needs must. I am not exactly lonely, but am a little depressed. I am definitely looking forwards to next year when  

I can come up with two explanations. 1. Being very different than the average (in any trait, really) means that, unless you’re one of the lucky ones, most things around you don’t satisfy you, since they weren’t built “for you” (or people like you). This will make you change your environment due to dissatisfaction and lack of sense of belonging at a certain point, and move somewhere else. And this, in turn, will basically kill (for you) the social environment you were a part of before the change - with various degrees depending on how radical the change is, you’ll have to start a new life from s 

When you are talking about the “high end” geniuses you will find that they are extremely obssessive about one or maybe two particular subjects (and any subjects directly related to those) over all others.

Many of those being things that “normal” people have at least some knowledge and common sense about. Even things like normal human interactions are not much more than vaguely functional just due to lack of time and experience wit 

It is the thrice-goddamned communication range which makes finding friends difficult and a spouse neigh impossible once your IQ is high enough. Not lack of interpersonal skills nor low emotional quotient. The higher your IQ is, the more skewed your communication range is towards the right half-plane of the Gaussian curve and the more difficult it is to find meaningful human relations. Including friends. The concept of communication range was established by Leta Hollingworth and it is +/- 2 sigmas or standard deviations - roughly 30 points - to either direction. Thus the communication range of so 

There is much less literature on the correlation between IQ and Intraversion than I expected, and the results that do exist seem to be quite mixed, ranging from negative, to positive to none. Therefore, I looked at some of my own data. In a study with 820 adults from the Metropolitan Region of Recife (MRR), Pernambuco, Brazil, the relationship found between IQ and Intraversion is depicted below.  So, indeed, those with IQs in the Gifted range tend to have substantially higher levels of Intraversion than the other strata of intelligence, at least in the MRR. Looking at the other social dimension of 

Imagine going through your cumulative years trying to learn as much as possible. Thinking that it was entirely normal, while simultaneously believing that you were behind everyone else. Others seemingly effortlessly picking up on social nuances that you felt you were oblivious to. Others forging friendships that would possibly last a lifetime as you struggled to make connections that may last a day. Wondering why you felt like such an outcast in what would otherwise be considered a cakewalk in this crazy ordeal that we classify as life. Depending on how far East you fall on the bell curve, and l 

What are the things no one tells you about living alone?
If you don’t have a pet, it’s quite lonely. Even a cat sleeping under the bed is more comforting than an empty house. It drags you down. If you drop something on the ground, it will stay there for 30 years unless you pick it up and put it away or throw it away. The only person you have to satisfy is yourself. Everything you do is good enough, if it’s good enough for you. You get used to seeing the same things day in and day out and as a result you don’t see things that are worn, dirty or out of date. Get a good friend to point these out to you. The number one thing you will miss but that everyone 

I moved out to London five months ago. Until then, I’d shared a bathroom and sometimes a bedroom for 18 years. This is more of a what no one tells you about living alone for the first time. You can poop with the door open. You can literally put your laptop outside the door, put on Netflix and watch Brooklyn 99 on the toilet. Heck, you could seat there and watch an entire episode, and no-one will know about it (unless you put it on Quora, obviously).Being financially independent is…terrifying. For example, you can spend £150 on a new tattoo and then eat powdered mac &amp; cheese from Poundland until

How truly liberating and amazing it is. This can be different for those who get lonely, I don’t. It is truly surreal not having anyone to call your name, just being able to relax and do what you want whenever you want. No one is pestering you. You only have you to cook for. It’s great. You can have company when you want and not have any when you don’t want. Meditation is a synch. I absolutely love it. I won’t be able to live alone again for many many years as I have children now and they are small. But believe me I can not wait until the day. The children I don’t actually mind. They are fun to h 

The following are things that people don’t tell you about living single.  Money is tight, and all the rent, utilities, food, insurance, groceries and taxes are paid by you. You can’t get fired, laid-off or have your hours cut.All the cooking, cleaning &amp; laundry tasks are performed by you alone, however, on the plus side, you are the only one making the mess.The TV remote belongs to you and you can watch whatever you want.The thermostat belongs to you and no-one is going to adjust the heat when they get home.The bed belongs to you and you can sleep in the middle or on the side, bedroom can be coo

Why would anyone tell you anything? Nobody did when I was forced to live alone, but then again I didn’t know anyone who lived alone. There are things about living alone that came as a surprise to me and shall list them here. I was shocked at how expensive living alone is! Having nobody to do the tasks that my late husband used to do and that I can’t do means that I have to pay people to do them for me. I don’t have any family so I can’t get help there. I just have to pay up. Weekends, public holiday times and traditionally family times are especially tough when you live alone especially when you  

Here are some things I have noticed from the perspective of living alone after becoming an empty-nester followed not long after by the death of my wife: - You get used to your own company After almost thirty hectic years of family life I now only have myself to think about. At first it was bewildering and a little scary. Of late I am starting to get used to my own routine--and even beginning to enjoy it a little. There are times (especially on returning to an empty house) when the loneliness hits me in the chest, but this is happening less and less. - You become a little selfish When the house was 

I am 81 and I have been living alone since spring of 2014 in August my wife of 35 years got a divorce because I asked her to we put the house in reverse mortgage in order to get the house committee rather than her and so that the my all the money that we got from the reverse mortgage was used to buy her out I got the house and my big General shop and then three years ago I build another shop strictly for woodworking because that's how I make money on the side I repair furniture refinishing design anything that somebody might want build it and that's why I need the shops plus I do my own Remode 

Living alone increases your productivity. If you work from home, have a side hustle, or have any kind of hobby then you’re gonna be a lot more productive living by yourself. For me, my productivity almost tripled after living alone. The amount of time wasted working around the house is going to be cut significantly when you live alone. I did my laundry in two loads once every two weeks, and on most days I had only one cup and one plate in the sink so doing the dishes was never a burden. Anytime can be a good time for a nap. I napped in the morning, at noon, and in the evenings sometimes just bec 

The things that no one tells you about living alone are huge. For starters, when adults between the ages of 40–60 live alone, they are regarded as social freaks. Because, you know, it’s abnormal for healthy adults to want to live alone. Some of us live alone because we lost a significant other and either can’t or won’t move on. Others, like myself, had to go through a lot of self inflicted torment early on in adult life. I didn’t want to have a normal life, and let me tell you, I didn’t. My parents were unfortunately not good role models for marriage, or divorce, but that’s another story. Cons 

That you get the most glorious well rested sleep ever. No one is snoring. Someone isn’t getting up at 6am for work, thus waking you up. No one is watching loud TV downstairs or playing their music, while you are just trying to rest and read a book. You don’t have to go though that whole, “Well what do you want for dinner”, - “Idk, what do you want for dinner” conversation every night. You don’t have to adjust your eating, life schedule and bio rhythms of someone else. No one scarfs down food you purchased for yourself. I mean my husband will adamantly tell me how much he hates mint chocolate chip 

What is the reason people live alone?
There are plenty of reasons, that one could choose to be lonely or seek refugee Of course, don’t get confused with terms like solitude, loneliness, downtime cos, all these things are different. Here’s the synopsis of common themes related to loneliness/introversion  Solitude - When one’s is deliberately wandering out to find a way to escape mundane/sober lifestyle of modern society. They might go for a long walk, travel to foreign countries alone. Downtime - This theme is commonly discussed around introversion community. Downtime, is obviously some time dedicated for doing merely stuff we really enj 

the reasons can be categorized into 3 categories. ( I would answer in the concept, why would someone become a “loner”) 1)people who lack social skillswhile people who have bad social skill can also make friends and relationships. they’re very prone to end up alone or to stay alone for a long while.they’re not good at maintaining friendships/relationships and obviously starting them. this is the first level. people who can’t attract others. not good at first impressions.usually, people who are autistic/Aspergers or were raised in specific environments, making their mindsets a specific way and 

I like to live alone. Why? Because: I am an introvert and living alone keeps me charged for interactions.I like to keep my surroundings clean. More people= more mess and most people don’t even get bothered.Cuz I am too much in love with doing things my way, be it cooking or dressing up or doing any of the household chores. I hate when people tell me to do a certain thing in a certain way. Bitch, I didn’t ask you so shut up!I offend people. I am better left alone cuz I can be a real pain in the ass sometimes.I like to be naked sometimes. I hate to get dressed up in the bathroom and then come out

I have read about and experienced Loneliness. Loneliness is a Sense of Fragmentation, an Alienation from Part of the World, often resulting in blinker vision, tunnel vision, the black plague as Camus called it..sometimes its worse when Midlife Crisis meets Loneliness…we feel a degree of Separation..of Alone ness ..it is a normal reaction also after a sudden death..or unexpected divorce, firing, outsourcing to say it politely…it can undermine our Sense of Self of Worth, Self Confidence…we need to Heal from it, …it requires addressing the Part of you with that Hurt and Meeting their Needs,,its fix 

The last time I was in a relationship was about a year and a half ago. We broke up because, although we love each other and remain close, we are irreconcilably incompatible. Living together represented years of relentless friction that exhausted us. Over the last couple of years of our seven year relationship I fantasized about having my own space. I wanted more than anything to live alone without having to push against anyone to express my preferences, the way I wanted to live, and, ultimately, who I was. After we broke up I did move into my own place, which was painful and lonely and felt like t 

Well, It's really how he/she perceives the world. As for me “I just love peace” And to some extent it's an intelligent descision and provides more meaningful connections and memories. For now I have some key points for you to note as to why alone is better. But this has it's own list of cons. You are away from all the bullshit the world has to offer. Yes, gossip, backbitching is far to common than you'll realise. And trust me every one is a hungry wolf nowadays. So let them cut one another out. “I love to be the spectator” to their little gameYou have more time to yourself: Now, this is fabulous.

I can only tell you why I like to live alone. First of all, I’m an introvert and am quickly depleted by being around others. The constant noise and stimulation wears me out, and gets on my last nerve. When I start getting this way and am unable to get away, I get very crabby and short-tempered. When I was married, twice, I was always trying to find a place to be alone, away from the incessant drone of the television that my husbands turned on the moment they arose, and didn’t turn off until they finally went to bed. It was like fingernails down a blackboard for me. That’s when I started taking

Let me tell my reasons for living alone But before that, I’m an extrovert !! So how is it that I like to live alone more despite being an extrovert ?? I do have a lot of friends no doubt . A lot of people do say so too. But in reality they’re only people I know! I don’t keep people really close to me . Some come some go. So my friends usually talk about their shit or us talking about kpop or anime in general or we do gossip. Well gossiping is something which is not worth to hear and I don’t wanna gossip but , I’m still involved in their talk. So hearing stuff like" This girl is a big hoe , she s

It can only be said that everyone has become more and more mature and stable. They don’t like to get together for some meaningless social interactions like before, and when a person matures, they will also like to be alone more and more, because of this Only when we are young can we settle down and do a good job. Maybe when we were young, we felt that everyone liked to hang out together. When we grow up, we gradually dislike the crowded environment, including gatherings with relatives, so we say this phenomenon It is normal.  Many people may find that in the past, everyone liked to gather for di 

How do unmarried elderly people with no children cope with loneliness, or are there people who are content being alone?
I fall right in your category as old/er, single and childless. Having written so many times about this subject on Quora, I haven’t got much to add except to say that I was lonelier in my marriage than I am today. People seem to worry about being alone an awful lot, but there really is nothing to fear. Once you have got over the fact that there is nobody there at the dinner table to talk to and nobody to snuggle up to in bed, loneliness does not play a part. You may even be better off on your own, and I know I am not the only person out there who feels this keenly. But the more I think of it now,  

I am an unmarried white woman forced into early retirement at 57. Another white woman over fifty was forced into retirement with me. I worked in government and this happened under the Obama administration. Eventually, two white men over fifty joined us. It was called the racial disparity task force. I am now 65, but due to arthritis and the emotional fallout from being deprived of my career after fighting to keep it for two and a half years, I am at times very dysfunctional, and under psychiatric care.. I feel that I am much older than my chronological age. More 85 than 65. I often feel confuse 

I am divorced from a satan type, so, it wasn’t a choice to be alone in old age. Two of my children died and the only one that is left I hardly see due to her living condition. How do I cope with loneliness? It is difficult for me due to the loss of my children. So I mostly try to keep my mind occupied. This is done by acquiring new hobbies and improving old ones. Writing and reciting poetry in public is one method. In between that I am painting with acrylics, making jewerly and orgones. I painted before, but the orgone thing is new. Orgones trap good energy and ease radiation from computers, ce 

I’m 76 years-old. My wife died 16 years ago. My dog died 2 years ago. My cat disappeared about 6 months ago. I have one child, a daughter who lives 7 miles from me. I have one brother and two sisters who live in other States. I have a hundred or so cousins and other relatives with whom I maintain a mutual disinterest. I retired from a job that kept me away from home Mon. thru Fri. for more than 20 years, so I never established significant community ties. My daughter visits me just about every weekend, and calls a couple times a week. My brother and I talk on the phone about once a month, visit  

I am 71 and alone. My entire family is deceased and I've never been married. The first holiday I had alone was Thanksgiving. I told myself it would be fine and I went to a diner. In the middle of my dinner I started crying, and went back home. I said that I would not allow this to happen again however at Christmas it was difficult though not uncontrollable. from that point it was a little easier because there are really no big holidays to remember things except my birthday was in January and there was nobody to care. As time went on I started going out to dinner in New York. Very nice places a 

I think you will find that some older people do very well on their own without a spouse or children, and some become very lonely and concerned. If they are childless, it is unlikely that they will suddenly decide they miss having the children they never had. It is probable that they came to terms with that situation years ago whether it was by choice or circumstance. I think the same might be true of being unmarried, assuming by that you mean they never married and are not now widowed or divorced, which would change things. The reality is that despite the stereotype of older people being isolat 

I know some people in this situation. Single elderly people who still can care for themselves tend to bug neighbors and door knockers for conversation. It´s quite normal that old people want to talk. They have a lifetime of information and memories in their heads just waiting to be explained. Introverts can take to loneliness far easier. They can use the radio for company, or more so these days, internet to reach out to people in forums. Some people use their local doctor or psychiatrist as a contact person, or a nurse, if they have care needs. It is sad when people must be old and live alone, bu 

Lots of thoughtful answers here. I sort of qualify. Although I don’t think of myself as elderly - but at nearly 81, I’m pretty sure I am. I’ve been lucky to remain healthy and active, both physically and mentally, as well as social. But I do live alone, having lost my wife of 43 years nine years ago. I do have an adult son - and although he lives a couple of hundred miles away, we talk all the time. And over the last several months, he and his girlfriend have been coming here for a couple of weeks at a time - not for me, but to get away from being so isolated in their apartments in their respect 

I am perfect;y content with being alone and have been since my husband died thirty years ago. There were times after he died that I contemplated remarrying; however, for a while I just wanted to be alone. The “for a while” stretched into first months and then years. After my husband died, there were several men that showed interest; however, I did not trust them. I heard, “I suppose your husband left you a lot of money.” Another question I frequently heard, “I guess you won’t sleep with another man unless you are married?” There were other questions that basically asked the same question. Have I 

I have always been somewhat of a loner. As far as friends go, I was more interested in quality rather than quantity and was usually the youngest in the group, so a lot of my friends are gone. My husband and I chose not to have children. We were best friends and didn't need children to fulfill us. We did almost everything together. He died 23 months ago. I retired at age 68 four months later. I have always been rather quiet and shy, but I got out of my comfort zone and joined a club for seniors, I also continued going to plays and doing the things my husband and I enjoyed together.

What is your best advice on living life alone and overcoming the challenges that solitude and freedom can have on oneself?
What was the biggest shock when you became a lone parent after splitting with your partner?
The biggest shock was how much more money I had. Even more pleasing was how much more time I had to spend with my child in a positive way without someone there to make everything a misery because they were “jealous,” of our baby’s and my relationship. It was also nice to not wake up in the middle of the night gasping for breath and puking to throw open all the windows and turn all the fans on for 20 minutes to stand outside in the phucking freezing cold while the house aired out because someone farted. It was awesome to walk into the bathroom and not have to spend 10 to 20 minutes cleaning it af 

My kids were 3, 6, 9 and 40. Once the 40-year-old moved out, my workload lightened so much it was stunning. Sure, there were less dishes and laundry and general crap around the house but the real workload, the telling him what he needed to be doing, following behind him and then doing it myself anyway, just vanished. Poof! I didn’t have to check to see if he picked up the right kid at the right time, I didn’t have to argue over who would stay home with a sick child, I didn’t have to remember birthdays and anniversaries on his calendar… all I had to do was everything I had done all along. By mysel 

I don’t think it qualifies as a “shock” but when I found myself a single father of three small children in 1970 I was amazed at how many women were sympathetic to a 30-year-old man raising small children on his own. The absence of the drug-addicted, alcoholic wife was a genuine relief, and the day-to-day life of raising two boys and a baby girl became easier. I know from years of experience single mothers do not have the same experiences I had with the opposite sex because of my single parental responsibilities. I was fortunate to have sufficient funds to hire help while I was at work, and I k 

What was the biggest shock when you became a lone parent after splitting with your partner? The quiet. No more crazy idiot demeaning us and harming us. The screaming fits are ended. No more reporting or asking permission. I owe no explanations ever again. The money. I had enough money to buy groceries and do the laundry and the laundromat. The asshole always stole every dime I had and blew it on whatever. I didn’t have much money to start with, and I did many loads of laundry by hand, and then, after he was gone, I could even afford to use the dryers! The cost of makeup went away. I didn’t need to 

While I did and still have help from my mother I will say that the biggest shock was that my income dropped significantly while my ex’s income went up substantially. I went to earning $92,000 ( before baby being born) a year to $26,000 + $12,000 child support (working part time as an RN) a year to now $12,000 a year (living off child support only). My ex went from $68,000 a year ( while we were married) to $110,000 (after the divorce) to now making $220,000 (working 2 full time jobs) a year. I am loving my little girl and all her giggles. She makes me laugh and we enjoy the simple things in li 

A2A. This may sound mundane, but my utility bills went down a lot. Less water, less light (I was a child under Carter during the energy crisis, and under Reagan as a teen, i lived without electricity), and less heat. When the kids aren't here on the winter, I leave the thermostat at 56F. This made up for the child support a bit. The most significant thing, however, was that I was free to be the father I wanted to be: free from another parent who suffered from clinical Anxiety. No, “she's crying, what did you do to her???” She cried, she's a baby. My youngest ex brother-in-law was the baby of the f 

I left my husband in the Middle East and returned to England. I spent six months planning my getaway in secret, as he had once threatened to take away my children. He could have taken them and refused to let me see them ever again. (His cousin actually did this to his English wife.) Back in England I was constantly looking over my shoulder, always afraid that he or one of his family members would appear and take them away. However, I felt really guilty about taking away his children as I thought he loved them, so when he contacted me to arrange a visit I agreed, though I intended to ensure that 

The biggest shock was learning how little my husband wanted communication with his children. His lack of communication with them in their young years was a “work of art” in the future when the children became adults. His lies to them about me has put a division in our relationship. First, our marriage did not deserve a divorce. It was a request from his mother that he fulfilled in order to be part of the family estate. Second, I married a handicapped person who had a motorcycle accident and walked with canes. . . .Making this story short, you can imagine how I was stretched in pulling every hour 

While married, I had a life that was always full of action. I was a full-time hands-on father and husband. We have a special needs son, and when the aides left for the day, I (being a male) took care of most of my son’s care. I bathed him, medicated him, fed him, did therapies with him, and dealt with his meltdowns. He was a teen by the time his mom and I split up. We also have a daughter (who is neurotypical). She went outside at the same time my son and I did. I watched both kids. I fed both kids. I cleaned up the messes of both kids. I put both kids to bed, and to my daughter, I read bedtime  

The biggest shock? That I could do this on my own and be happy. My ex was like a 3rd child when we were together. He was needy, irresponsible, but yet had the view that women cook and take care of their man yet he complained about paying bills, watching his kids while I had to work, etc. He was never happy. Then one day he threatened to break up with me for the millionth time and I said ok. Issued a huge shock to him. And I stuck with it. I moved my kids and I to a small apartment and I searched for a better job. I landed an amazing job with great pay, I moved into a 4 bed/2 bath house with an 

When did you feel alone?
 I'm reluctant to post this answer for fear of trivializing the question. It's very tame experience compared to the lonliness that others may have felt in dire or tragic circumstances. The year was 1970. I'd spent 3 months traveling in Europe with my lover. We had a great trip living like vagabond artists seeing galleries, museums and cathedrals. We had timed our exit perfectly. Our 3 month Eurail pass was expired (we slept 30 nights on trains) and so was our money. Somehow, drunkenly, we arrived at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. We had booked some weird no name charter flight. It was delayed for  

Hm, when I realized that nobody understands me, it's actually true. Not my parents, not even my sisters or best friends understand me. Being of a different school of thoughts, being of different passion, bearing different interests than all of those makes me feel like I'm alone. I'll tell you about this one time (out of numerous) when I felt alone and it felt terrible. As my bio suggests that I'm a huge sports fan, I breathe sports, I eat sports, I live by sports. Pakistan (finally) organized a Cricket league of its own last year named Pakistan Super League. I couldn't believe my life, it took  

I live with my mom. I have elder sister who recently got married on 1st Dec. Being introvert, shy and not so social, we have almost lived all our lives solely. While I was pretty close to my sister, when she left for her in-laws house, I cried whole night...I couldn't bare that emptiness. That right moment, I felt someone should have been there for me to console me, comfort me...But I was alone on my bed, crying like a baby, without anyone's shoulder. I traveled 4 countries in last 2 years. All of them onsite trips and solo travelling was really fun. So 3 of those countries I visited are from E 

4th April, 2017. I was at my parental home. I was pregnant at that time and despite the house being full of family members and relatives, I was confined to my room with strict instructions not to come out until I was told to. Why, you may ask? I had just lost my father a few days back and being pregnant, I was asked to keep away from the final rituals and the mourning gatherings that followed. Though someone would come and check on me and regarding my health every now and then, I was dreadfully cranky. I wasn't allowed to pay my last respects to him, I wasn't allowed to see him for the last time. T 

I feel alone almost all of the time I am surrounded by many people like my family,my colleagues,my friends,my co-travellers on my daily route.Most of them see me daily.But No one among them Can imagine that I am lonely soul.The reason behind this is that they always find a happy go lucky person,a cheerful enthusiastic with required professionalism, family finds a adorable and sincere daughter who fulfills all her “social and moral duties” and friends always find a go-to person in me whom they can rely upon, can call me anytime as I am always available for everyone.Commonly,no one holds any grud 

I am alone almost 24/7. I do go out to different doctor appointments or to get groceries. But when it comes to shopping for groceries or things like shampoo, conditioner, etc. (your basic hygiene things), I know what I need, I go in the site, get, the stuff and leave. I do not wander they the aisles or browse different departments in a store. I prefer it this way because I'm much happier being alone than being forced to make small talk because in general I just don't like people. When I was in my 20′s to late 30′s, I was a social butterfly and loved being the center of attention. I thrived on h 

I feel alone all the time. Especially at work. I divorced in 2004, when my wife realized she didn’t love me anymore and invented a bullshit story (that I was an addict, which couldn’t have been more untrue) to tell friends and strangers so as to eject me from her life. My love wasn’t good enough. Soon after that I started dating a wonderful woman. We had a fantastic, sound, happy relationship. After a year and a half, she too realized she didn’t love me and broke up with me. My love wasn’t good enough. She was the last person I had sex with. That was over fifteen years ago. Since then I’ve dated  

I always remember one night when, tired of being home alone, I walked to the little park around the neighborhood, sat on a bench, in the dark, and thought how utterly alone I was. I even remember what I was wearing. I was 40 years old. I had divorced a horrible abuser 6 years before. I had cut contact with all my friends because I’d discovered that I was their doormat. My parents had become old and very sick and my siblings had a plan to con them out of their meager lifelong savings for old age. The plan included separating me from the family so I wouldn’t be an obstacle towards their goal. Sinc

1st half of November 2017 I didn't felt alone actually. It was something like one of a worst phase of my life which had come and so shall pass too. So,it was only a few days that my Diwali vacations came to an end and I came back from home. But then,all of a sudden one of my closest friend stopped talking to me. Now I am a kind of girl who keeps thinking about one matter entire day and that makes me way too tensed. So,I was very depressed. Then suddenly I came to know that my father had a financial loss of 2.2 lakhs. It was a huge amount,so my family was melancholic too. And I,being alone here,wa

But… When someone attacks the dignity of the Beloved Holy Prophet ﷺ, it is “Freedom Of Speech/Expression”. Wow! Good going.. P.S: I don't defend attacking afore mentioned people/groups, but I condemn the act of hurting Muslim’s feelings or in gen 

MODERN ART I HATE modern art. I hate modern art more than I like normal art, and I really like normal art. I am a painter myself. While I am not very good I am capable enough and I enjoy the hobby. Here are some of my works- one copying my all-time favorite artist Zdzisław Beksiński.  I’m no great artist- I just find it relaxes me. But still even my very amateur paintings take a degree of skill. I had to learn to paint trees and mountains- I had to learn about color and mixing. It took time and years of effort. This leads into why I hate modern art. I’m just gonna make a list #1: It requires NO skil 

What makes me angry at our world is that other humans blame people that are just as much victims of our world as they are. If we changed the very society that resulted in all the abuse, ill action, illness and despair existent today, hardly anyone would be a perpetrator or a victim. It is extremely hard for me to sit on the sidelines and watch this, especially when most people are too blind to see what I see, and so when I point it out, it goes to unseen eyes. If you stopped sitting on your ass and actually took the necessary means of action about our current world, instead of shame and condemn p

Kenny Nguyen's answer to What are your most controversial or unpopular opinions? On January 2018, a woman name Brittany Smith was raped by her friend.

This is anonymous because I know a lot of people are not going to agree. This is my opinion, and I’m going to say it. In response to the question: I don’t know, everything. No one truly cares about anything other than themselves. I saw a guy kicking a homeless man and what do the pedestrians do? Nothing. And so did I. I also did nothing. I just walked on, because I didn’t want any trouble. Everyone, including me, is an asshole. Humans are terrible creatures.

Hypocrisy A few days back I was talking to one of my friends and we had discussion about her marriage. She comes from a rich family and had a lavish wedding. Her parents had kept a book with all the details about her marriage, including what others had given as gift. The reason to keep this tab was to make sure they don’t give someone less than what was received as gift (As per her). Whether you agree or not, but the truth is that these tabs are kept in order to make sure that, even by mistake we don’t give someone more than what we got.

There was this woman on Instagram who posted some…rather controversial posts. Take note that even though I'll be showing multiple pictures for this, I consider it as a whole complete picture because it's all related to one post.           As of writing, the account has been set to private, and there have been several accounts with the same profile pic but nearly different usernames (to probably be more anonymous🤷🏻‍♂️). And there has been no word from Harvard. Regardless, this level of ignorance and selfishness is amazingly abhorrent. And as usual, Instagram didn't remove the post because “it doesn't vi 

Why do people get angry at 'it's okay to be white' signs?
Because progressives took the bait. They got played, did exactly what everyone expected them to do, and completely took the bait. Let’s talk about the statement in itself, and eventually I’ll get to why people reacted the way they did.  Origin of the Slogan  The imageboard site 4chan is responsible for about half of all the controversies on the Internet, and this slogan campaign was no different. The year was 2017, and it was Halloween night. While I was at a Halloween party without a care in the world, there was a full-on campaign being orchestrated, all on the /pol/ board of 4chan. You can find the 

It’s a trolling message targeting those eejits who seem to think that all the evils in the world are somehow perpetrated by white people. As if white people somehow went to Sierra Leone and Liberia during the civil wars and mind controlled black people to engage in cannibalism. As if white people somehow convinced the mixed bunch of Daesh to commit the atrocities they’ve committed and which do not belong in this century. The truth is much simpler. And that is, the brown gradient of the skin, the quantity of melanin has nothing to do with behaviour. White, brown or black people can all be just a 

“Why do people get angry at ‘it’s okay to be white’ signs? Because it’s nothing but antagonistic trolling. White people are not suffering. They are not under attack. There is no widespread or institutional bias against white people. So there is no reason to tell anyone, “It’s okay to be white.” I know it’s okay to be white. Heck, by every measure it is GREAT to be white. The only people who think whites are under attack are racists. The primary narrative of racists is that white people are (somehow) endangered or under attack. It is an absurd idea, but it is nonetheless what they believe. Since o 

There is a theme in the world that some refer to as Cutting the Tall Poppies, Vonnegut wrote about this odd behavior of Humans. His book was 2081; ”Harrison Bergeron”. In this book the brightest minds had loud noises pulse through their Brain any time they were nearing a solution to anything. The best dancers were shackled, the most beautiful were covered with Hideous masks. Dysgenics Personified. TO be more specific. The people of the Nations have been taught to Hate their White Kin, and view them as the enemy of all. Not realizing that all Races have great souls, and all have villainous ones.

I can’t know for sure what motivates a person to hold up an “It’s OK to be white” poster. And while I’m not mad to see a poster like that, it’s disappointing because it’s clear that there are some fundamental misunderstandings in the way people communicate with each other around race. Do they really feel like there’s a significant number of people think that it’s not OK to be white? Because I doubt that is the case. However I do understand why some white people are put off when terms like “white privilege” are used. It’s a thought provoking concept but all some people will hear is that they got s 

Black people in this land have been struggling for hundreds of years, to achieve acceptance—an acknowledgment that “It’s okay to be black.” And, in spite of the efforts they’ve made, in spite of their excelling in so many fields, showing themselves to be willing and able to do work that pays well, they continue to be required to do something extra, something not required of white people, just to have a place at the table. To have so many extra efforts required of them, just to “break even,” and then to see a sign such as this one, “It’s okay to be white,” as if white people were expected to pro 

“Why do people find the `Its okay to be white’ posters and stickers that pop up on random things so offensive?” It’s due to a lack of intellectual discipline. They’re being played by clever racists.

These have been popular with both racists who lament the loss of the Civil War and opposed the Civil Rights movement, and they’ve also been popular with people who just like the south. Well, the SJW’s decided that, because these symbols are popular with racists, we should not tolerate them. Demands came for the monume 

 The answer is simple and obvious: Cognitive dissonance.

But that is just their ridiculous imaginations at work and really their white hatred. Even plenty of white people are self loathing.

They are not all bad. I am indebted to two of them for going out of their way to help me.  However, the goodness of those two is dwarfed by the self-absorbed, the twisted, the ignorant and the charlatans that have made up the rest of those I have had the misfortune to have known and the even greater misfortune to have been subject to.. Especially as a kid. I didn't come to realize this revilement overnight. Not 

How some bosses think they can treat their employees as shit.

Oh, that's such an easy question for me to answer. When a traditional, conservative Christian tells me that they “Hate the sin but love the sinner,” with respect to LGBTQ people I become righteously enraged. That's got to be one of the most horrible and depressing things one human being can say to another. The traditional Christian condemnation and stigmatization of us queer people as sinners has led to unspeakable levels of human suffering in the world.

Just a couple of months back, the nation witnessed a heinous act of rape and murder of an 8 year old kashmiri girl, Asifa.! We had people who were ashamed of being Indians .Moreover i have some people in my group, who were bashing and shaming the entire hindu community! There were candle marches, protests, people were changing dps demanding justice for the girl! That's right! Any sane person will stand up against any such crime against humanity!
