What are the types of people that you should always avoid?
Avoid is probably not enough. I was once in my apartment which I was renting with my girlfriend some 10 years ago. She invited one of her girl friends over to our place to see each other and have a cup of tea. She showed up with her boyfriend. It was September, they had just returned from their vacations in Asia. They hadn’t seen each other for months and they were eager to show each other all the cool stuff they had been experiencing. Our vacations were not that exotic as theirs but quite interesting through the Balkans, where my girlfriend got to meet my parents and family. Being from a Norther 

I understand that my answer will probably affect more who lives abroad than who doesn’t and has not interest in leaving his/her own country, but in my fairly long experience away from my own country, what I really came to avoid is people that moved to a country and keeps complaining about everything and everyone there, and constantly talking about how much he/she misses home, and how “things are better there”.For example, I lived in London for a few years, and was sick and tired of talking with Italians (I am Italian, I guess the name tells it) that, holding their slice of pizza take-away bou

Here are the 10 types of people, among other, I try to avoid: 1. The “Askhole” The Askhole is the person who asks for your advice, tells you how wise and helpful it is, thanks you for it, does the exact opposite of what you advised, asks again for your advice on the same problem, and repeats this cycle to leave you eventually feeling like that pair of jeans which has seen one wash too many. 2.

The I-me-I will leave you bone-tired - physically and mentally - with his incessant talking and almost unendurable, detail 

People who have a negative opinion about an entire demographic but tell you you're "different," or "one of the good ones," so you can be pals.

These people are ignorant and bigots. Don't be friends with them because they happen to like you.

While not nearly as severe as some of the groups of people that were presented here, I’d like to propose the complete avoidance of those people that completely change depending on who they’re in a relationship with.

I’ve met two of these cases so far. One of them was an incredibly meek guy. The type of person who soils himself just because you moved too fast for some reason. He was hopelessly romantic 

People that heavily trash talk their exes. Instant red flag. You loved them once. Give your past relationships respect and move on.People that “one up” all of your stories and achievements.

They’re the kind of friend that just can’t be sincerely happy for you.People that hardcore flirt with people’s boyfriends or girlfriends in front of their partners, often making sure the person notices it.

They may also treat you as a certain kind of competitor, wanting the same things as you, or developing the same hobbies as you, and want to surpass you.And if they can’t be better than you, they will find ways to destroy your happiness.

Does anyone want to write their heart out here?
I’ve been thinking about death for so long. I know people see it as “the weak” or “easy” way out, but there’s nothing easy about that. For eleven years I haven’t felt true happiness. I’ve tried pills and therapy, and nothing. I’m still really young, not even old enough to drink (US). I want to be happy, and I want to be at peace. I think if I were to kill myself I’d stop being so damn sad, and my friends can finally stop worrying. It’s a choice I’m making, and I don’t see the reason why I should be stopped. Should someone who’s not themselves be stopped from being happy? It’s like having somethin 

I got stoned this afternoon for the first time in 36 years. I used to smoke casually on weekends with friends, but I didn’t want to drag gunk into my lungs now that I’m older. I went with an edible and stupidly ate a little too much. It hit my like a bomb, edging close to be hallucinatory. Not quite there, but then again I’ve never hallucinated so I’m just guessing .It was kind of a scary experience for awhile until it all started to smooth out. Next time, maybe in a few weeks, I’ll eat a LOT less. 3.7K views · View upvotes5Sponsored by DudaHow do I build professional sites that won't need a chaperone?Do you go to bed praying your client's website will still be intact in the morning?

How are you different from your spouse/life partner?
Apoorva Malhotra this one’s for you, babe. She is red to my blue. I’m old-school and she’s so cool. Differences - differences. We have them galore, but thankfully they have never really come as an obstacle for us as people in love. The differences are so deep-rooted that I shall have to start from the very beginning.

In the same time frame, she was a recluse, living in her little world that was devoid of friends given how shy she was. My friends increased by Geometric Progression after every outing, while her fri 

Well, I married to a most beautiful girl couple of months ago.  People always try to find a life partner with same mentality, same views, same status, everything same. What I find beautiful in our relationship is the word “difference”.  There are numerous differences between us (I’m not only going to enlist the differences but also how these differences are making our life beautiful):- She is fond of the chinese food but I’m not(I always ask her for a healthy diet).I’m short tempered and she cool(that’s the spine of our relationship, she knows how to deal with my anger).She gets nervous very easily

I can sing hymns with the church congregation but need to make sure that the volume of my voice stays lower. I can preach and teach. I am more like a guy with one talent (in the parable of Jesus) and she is more like the one with five talents. 4. My wife is a quick and smart t 

This question makes me smile for it’s the differences that I find endearing. My husband is a go-getter. If he wants something, he will move mountains albeit silently.

He will do things to express this. He’s more of a hugger/cuddler/kisser. So am I, but I guess, being a woman, I’m verbal as well.

What is it that nobody tells you about having children?
That you will be chained to your house and unable to leave without a gigantic hassle each and every time. And if you have multiple young children (twins or close in age) it will not be twice as hard, but exponentially more hard, to do anything. That you should understand that you are now a prisoner who is dependent on the willingness or ability of others to help you escape your prison, even if it is for a little while. If not, then you have to bring them with your EVERYWHERE. You can't run out to the store for eggs or milk because you forgot them. No, it doesn't work this way. First everyone h 

Since I was told little or nothing about having kids, this question, for me, is a wide-open field. Here are the thoughts I find most helpful: 1. Good parenting is both the simplest thing in the world and the hardest thing in the world. 2. It is the simplest thing because there is one cardinal rule: whatever behavior or character trait you want your kids to display, you must model for them. If you want them to read instead of just mindlessly turning on the tube, let them see you doing that. If you want them to show restraint, let them see you giving a calm and civil answer to an impudent customer 

No one tells you anything truthful about having children. Seriously. I don't know why we keep it all to ourselves. I mean, we tell others the good stuff. How sweet new babies are. How much we learn about love. We tell expecting parents how exciting it is to watch your child grow, how amazingly wonderful it feels when they lay their sweet little heads on your shoulder. When they say ‘I love you’ to you in their tiny toddler voices. Hearing those words really is a rush of pure goodness. And having kids is truly one of my greatest joys. It won't sound like it for a minute- but hear me out. For some  

Everybody generically tells you about having kids “it's hard, but it's SOOOOO worth it.” Ok, but that's not helpful. And most of these people are too far removed from the early transition of going from no kids, to kids, that their advice lacks a memory of the difficult days. So, here's what I wish someone did tell me: You will be sleep deprived in a way you never have been before. This may include consecutive sleepless nights. And sleep deprivation brings out the worst in everyone, including your spouse, and you. You will be irrationalLabor may not go as planned. Birth classes will empower you to

For me, it was the incredible toll it takes on your relationship. I’d like to preface that this is not everyone’s experience and I never for a minute regret my children, I love them dearly and cherish my time with them. So with that all said lets begin! My then girlfriend and I met when we were 16 and just instantly clicked. We had everything in common, we had a very similar sense of humour and we loved doing everything together, conquering life together and just being in that first love bliss that didn’t change at all for over 8 years, we had ups and downs but at the end of the day we had each 

A lot of incredible responses here (I've read them all as of right now). No need to repeat them although kudos especially to Jacob VanWagoner (that PHD comic is right on target), Mira Zaslove, Janice Schwarz, Rab Letham and Jason Silverstein's answers below, among the many other great ones here. My first (currently only) child is now 2.5 months old, so it's still early, but with that disclaimer safely out of the way I'll happily share my current experience: 1. Nobody tells you what it will be that will hit you the hardest in those early first weeks because everybody's "hardest" is different. We 

They don’t tell you, when the labor ends, and the last supportive words of encouragement have finally resulted in the birth of your child…as you lay there out of breath, sweat laddened hair plastered to your face, the beating of your heart so loud in your ears, will gradually begin muting everything else. No beeping heart monitor, no cheerful exclamations, because without realizing it, until you hear him take his first gasping breath of life, you’ve been holding yours. Now the ooohs and awwws of family and nurses play distantly in the background because all you’ll hear is the sound of his cry. 

I have 8 children - 4 girls and 4 boys - and yes, they are all mine.  Once this round of rather close birthdays completes, they will be 26, 22, 20, 18, 16, 14, 5, and 3. also have 3 grandchildren, so I have been doing this for over half of my life, and I have heard most things by now.  In fact I have probably heard both sides of most things.  But I will share a couple that I don't believe I have heard anyone else say. First, no one told me about the strong thread of animosity that exists towards people (and most especially mothers) of many.  Having a big family is challenging and demanding but  

I've read through so many of these answers and I'll tell you the answers to what no one told me. I fully expected it to be hard. I think most people do, just don't expect it will be as hard as it ended up being for them. I deal with severe chronic pain and I never thought being a mom was possible. So hard was what I prepared for. I also expected the fear of something bad happening. That fear can wake you up in the night and fill you horrible images that you never wanted to imagine. I knew bad things could and do happen. I also knew that we remain eternally optimistic that we will be spared that 

I don't know if my observation is true for women, but I'm pretty sure that it is for most men. We men like dramatic situations that allows us to be heroes. We want to prove our love for our children in a single dramatic incident, which in turn also gives us the opportunity for a great story. "Remember that time where that drunk driver almost hit our daughter and I hauled his ass out of the car and held him down while you called the police? That was awesome!" Or perhaps it could be a conflict with another parent who has a child that bullies my child or pretty much whichever circumstances that allo 

What's an unpopular opinion you have about relationships?
I wouldn’t say that my opinions on relationships are “unpopular” as such, but perhaps I have some opinions that would be less favourable to some people if they were in that situation. One of them that I have is that a vast amount of people are not actually “in love” with their partner. They are simply in love with the idea of being in love or the idea they have of their partner and not the reality. I believe that there is a big difference between being in love with a person and an idea. The idea that some people have in their head is this idealised version of a the relationship that they think t 

Society should be structured for teenagers to marry. There. That got your attention. First off, I need to clarify a few things because some of you are already jumping to the wrong conclusions. For the first part, when I say, “teenagers”, I don’t mean 13 year-olds. I mean 18 years. If you can fight and die for your country or elect the future leaders of it, you should be considered mature enough to enter into lifelong arrangements with a consenting partner of equal standing. Society allows it, but it isn’t structured for those kinds of marriages to be successful. Second, my definition of marriage p 

The vast majority of relationships are based on low self confidence and manipulations. When a person is born he`s given a figurative book of rules that he must obey. This book is written mainly by society to create some kind of order. The problem is that people who are both emotionally and psychologically immature due to their young age , receive blocks of information from this “book” that they are not being able to analyze. The best example is: Cheating. If you ask a random person on the street what is “cheating”, he`ll most likely tell you that cheating is having sex with any person other than  

Men are more objectified than women. Yes, I am a woman, and I came to this conclusion, and I hate having to admit it. I have always vouched for women and women rights, and equality movements, but I came to realize recently that maybe men as well need similar movements. Objectification has been mostly associated with women being sexually objectified by men. While it is true women are often objectified and measured based on their looks, they are guilty of the same, but the matter of the objectification is sometimes different. A friend of mine was seeing someone she had recently met. One day we were  

These are some of my opinions. Feel free to disagree. Most people, even mature ones sometimes, do not know what is the difference between Lust, Infatuation, and Love. And I mean that truly. Sometimes a lot of people get so hung up on attraction and spark that they find it hard to distinguish these feelings.If you have a gaping hole in your heart or a big crack and honestly believe it can be mended when another person is with you, and you don't work on it, then any relationship you go into is going to fail.Love does not conquer all. It is easier to do that in movies and stories because it is hop

Bullshit. Partnership happens when one person’s fucked-up corresponds with another person's fucked-up. Kinda like a jigsaw puzzle depicting a land fill. If you want to be partnered, you need tenacity and willingness. That’s it. The rest: maturity, empathy, blah blah, is helpful. But relationships exist because teeth were clenched and closed fists hung on in determination. You can be single or coupled, but eit 

Unconditional love doesn’t exist &amp; Love can’t overcome everything. Every love comes with conditions. In a romantic relationship people are looking for someone who can fulfill their needs (for example sex, appreciation, support etc.). If someone can fulfill their needs and they are compatible they love the person, once the person stops fulfilling too many of their most important needs love starts to fade away, in the worst scenario it turns into hatred. Even in a parent-child relationship there is no real unconditional love, being their child is already a condition in itself. But apart from this  

Compromising and making sacrifices aren’t always the solution Source : Unsplash We’re constantly bombarded with the notion that compromising and making sacrifices are the key to a successful relationship, I’d like to think it’s not as black/white as that. While it’s healthy to think about the other person’s needs and meet each other halfway : There’s a fine line between compromising on what to eat for dinner or where to go on vacation than compromising your beliefs and values for your partner.

I came across this girl on a social media. She pinged, I replied, frequencies matched and we felt a little less space between us. We lived in remote towns. We met only once. I got a spare day in her town and we decided to meet in a park. That evening, we talked about ants and galaxies. She leaned her head on my shoulder as sun bid us goodbye and the faint sunrays it left showed the brown tint in her eyes. She was gorgeous and so was that evening. We felt calm inside our rebellious heads. Our hands cupped each other as we walked, talking about nature and serendipities. Soon, we were back into our

I’ve been thinking about death for so long. I know people see it as “the weak” or “easy” way out, but there’s nothing easy about that. For eleven years I haven’t felt true happiness. I’ve tried pills and therapy, and nothing. I’m still really young, not even old enough to drink (US). I want to be happy, and I want to be at peace. I think if I were to kill myself I’d stop being so damn sad, and my friends can finally stop worrying. It’s a choice I’m making, and I don’t see the reason why I should be stopped. Should someone who’s not themselves be stopped from being happy? It’s like having somethin 

I got stoned this afternoon for the first time in 36 years. I used to smoke casually on weekends with friends, but I didn’t want to drag gunk into my lungs now that I’m older. I went with an edible and stupidly ate a little too much. It hit my like a bomb, edging close to be hallucinatory. Not quite there, but then again I’ve never hallucinated so I’m just guessing .It was kind of a scary experience for awhile until it all started to smooth out.

What ended your relationship with your best friend?
“They want your good life." This is how a close friend described the animosity of my ex-bestfriend and an ex close friend towards me. My bestfriend and I met during our first year in uni. I was 16 and she was 17. She was well off and I was dirt poor, but we became as close as sisters. I was in uni because of a scholarship. Although my scholarship included stipends, they were always delayed. So I often had no money for food and payment for my boarding house. Our university was two hours away from home by bus. I had five younger siblings and my dad, who's a carpenter, was often sick at the time. M 

I had been living in Oxford for about a year after moving down from Edinburgh. Was working in a pretty cool place that did awesome coffee in the daytime then transitioned into a cocktail place in the evenings. I started pretty much at the same time as another girl, Kayley. We hit it off straight away, bonding over a mutual hatred of our new manager 😂🤦🏼‍♀️ (We were 22, don’t judge!). We were hanging out outside of work etc and after about a year and a half we were, I guess, « best friends ».  My lease was up on my rental, and Kayley &amp; her boyfriend had a spare room in their place, which I gladl 

We moved in together We met at high school, I was 16, she was 18. She was the popular girl, pretty, never without a boyfriend since she had been 14. I was the nerd. With blue hair and a difficult home life. Still single and would stay so into my 20s. I was very dedicated to school work, because I wanted to get out. After high school, I left the country by myself for a while, then returned and started college in another, much bigger city. We kept in touch, met on the weekends. I was always the side-kick, she was the star. I was content with that. I met people, I got out, I was cool by proxy. There 

A birthday party. We had been friends for about 20 years. Two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year. Our birthdays were 17 days apart. She had my back emotionally and saw me through tough times with love and kindness. I hoped that I did the same for her. I lost count of the times that she’d called in a panic ‘cos she’d had a flip out at a boyfriends and wanted me to run round in my car and get her out of there before he came home. We laughed about those times. We cried over other times. We watched telly together on the phone when we were in different parts of the country. We share 

Many things. So many. This is going to be very long. We met at school, we weren't in the same class (she was in 9th and I in 10th grade) but some elective courses were for multiple classes so we had one of those together. I saw her drawing something in an anime style one day, and I had just recently gotten into anime and drawing, so I commented about it. We had a few conversations that year, though we didn't become friends just yet. I had to repeat 10th grade due to my grades. We didn't end up in the same class, but we ended up having a bunch of classes together anyways. The first day, I didn't  

“I've watched you bounce in and out of awful relationships every since I've known you, and I've always thought.. Why couldn't it be me?” But that wasn't what killed it… This was my best friend.

She and Mark had moved from Scotland to London as a couple, then she had met someone else, split up with Mark, and asked her new partner to move in, and now they all lived in the same, awkward house!

We spent the next 5 years working side by side sharing our joys, happinesses, trials and tribulations. I shared things with her that I never shared with anyone else and she did the same with me. We were closer than sisters. Annie had a wonderful, carefree life. She and her husband were qui

What relationship sin should you avoid at all costs?
Sean, you’ve read enough of my answers about relationships to know that there is certainly far more than one relationship sin that should absolutely be avoided at all costs. I’m going to write a short list of the three most important things to avoid in any relationship, and then I’ll go into detail about each one in turn: First and foremost, as should be obvious, is infidelity.Secondly, and possibly equally important, is dishonesty, including the keeping of secrets.Refusal to openly communicate one’s feelings in a productive mannerSo obviously, the biggest relationship sin that is almost always  

It's 2019 and still there are some things which haven't changed over the past years. Instead they're getting worse. I'm talking about beliefs that we've developed about love and relationship. Now it's clearly seen nowadays how movies, music, TV, etc flaunt upon us a false picture of true love or an ideal relationship and reinforce us to believe it. We develop some unrealistic ideas in our mind about how a perfect relationship exists! And when we realize how certain things don't work as how we picture and fantasize it, we stumble and collapse! I guess the worst sin you could avoid doing in a rela 

My mind wanders down many paths of contemplation on this one. Several assumption must be made, because words do have meaning. I'll begin by tossing out the probable disqualifiers, so further cement my point later on. So, let's start by assuming that this is a consensual relationship that both people enter in to willingly and with good faith towards the other. Let's say that they both actually want this to work. That throws out the good ol' “Poison him in his sleep with undetectable drugs and collect the insurance money after I'm made a citizen" sin. And that sin is a doozie, but really it's not  

Everybody has a life. Its important to have some “me time” once in a while. For people who wonder what they look like in others' eyes need a break at times to look in the mirror and say , "Hey , I love you" In most relationships , relationships in general , one person is so much into the other, loves them to the moon and back , makes them their first priority and what not. However , to the other person , they are just an important aspect of their lives and not their lives altogether. Its important to note here that just because they don't love us back with the same passion as we do , we don't b 

There are several relationship sins that we should avoid. These include: Having many friends from the opposite sex. This makes people/partners/lovers/spouses jealous.Letting the other person always being the first one to text. You should show that you miss someone too. Today, text first.Taking breaks for no good reason. If we are doing well and not fighting a lot, no breaks are needed.Comparing our love to other people's love. Let us be ourselves.Denying each other sex and time to hang out. If you are of age, these are healthy.Gossiping about others. This shows that you are not happy. Just love

It’s going to be a really tiring day. The meeting is about to start with a major client, and the boss has already loaded you with the next deadline. Pearls of anxiety drop from your forehead. You can’t afford to screw this. You just can’t. You try to calm yourself down, but the negative possibilities start barraging your mind on a loop. You take a deep breath. You enter the room faking a smile. The presentation starts. Slide 1… slide 2… slide 3. The yawning face of the client is already making you dreary. The piercing glance from your boss is adding fear in the right quantities. You so want to sail thr 

1. Pride Does your ego or your pride prevent you from acknowledging your partner and their success? Are you overly consumed by your own importance or appearance and neglect your partner in the process? Do you refuse to admit when you are in the wrong? Or do you refuse to seek help when you need it, then resent your partner for it? If these sound familiar, you need to learn to let go of the ego and embrace humility. Start to acknowledge and appreciate the little things your partner does. Be prepared to concede when you are in the wrong. Swallow your pride and ask for help occasionally. This may 

You should never turn your partner’s generosity into your entitlement. For example: In my previous marriage, I cooked all the dinners. I would make his plate, and bring it to wherever he was. I would do this for anyone I cooked for, because I’m sweet like that. It’s a quiet way of giving affection and being considerate. One time, early in our marriage, he had a busy couple weeks. So, to be thoughtful, I began packing his lunch for those days. He needed to leave early, so I began cooking and packing him a breakfast to reheat at work. These were things I did out of love and kindness. Fast forward fi 

What relationship sin should you avoid at all costs? Avoid the sin of believing or thinking that it’s still all about you. I am kind of aiming all this at my bros, but it’s for either partner. When you were single, it was all about you. But if you are in a serious relationship or are married, it’s now also about him or her. Avoid this sin by considering the following: Don’t be a slob. You come home at the end of the day and the house is a mess or there’s dirty dishes piled in the sink, do not ignore it. Roll up your sleeves and clean it up. Share those responsibilities with your SO. My sweet wife

That girl who approached from Facebook. She was drop dead gorgeous. I’ve sent you a picture no? She - She’s pretty. But the other girl, That one from Instagram was prettier. He - Yes, How can I forget about her! But her messages were lagging. She was taking time between replies. That 

What is it that nobody tells you about having children?
That you will be chained to your house and unable to leave without a gigantic hassle each and every time. And if you have multiple young children (twins or close in age) it will not be twice as hard, but exponentially more hard, to do anything. That you should understand that you are now a prisoner who is dependent on the willingness or ability of others to help you escape your prison, even if it is for a little while. If not, then you have to bring them with your EVERYWHERE. You can't run out to the store for eggs or milk because you forgot them. No, it doesn't work this way. First everyone h 

Since I was told little or nothing about having kids, this question, for me, is a wide-open field. Here are the thoughts I find most helpful: 1. Good parenting is both the simplest thing in the world and the hardest thing in the world. 2. It is the simplest thing because there is one cardinal rule: whatever behavior or character trait you want your kids to display, you must model for them. If you want them to read instead of just mindlessly turning on the tube, let them see you doing that. If you want them to show restraint, let them see you giving a calm and civil answer to an impudent customer 

No one tells you anything truthful about having children. Seriously. I don't know why we keep it all to ourselves. I mean, we tell others the good stuff. How sweet new babies are. How much we learn about love. We tell expecting parents how exciting it is to watch your child grow, how amazingly wonderful it feels when they lay their sweet little heads on your shoulder. When they say ‘I love you’ to you in their tiny toddler voices. Hearing those words really is a rush of pure goodness. And having kids is truly one of my greatest joys. It won't sound like it for a minute- but hear me out. For some  

Everybody generically tells you about having kids “it's hard, but it's SOOOOO worth it.” Ok, but that's not helpful. And most of these people are too far removed from the early transition of going from no kids, to kids, that their advice lacks a memory of the difficult days. So, here's what I wish someone did tell me: You will be sleep deprived in a way you never have been before. This may include consecutive sleepless nights. And sleep deprivation brings out the worst in everyone, including your spouse, and you. You will be irrationalLabor may not go as planned. Birth classes will empower you to

For me, it was the incredible toll it takes on your relationship. I’d like to preface that this is not everyone’s experience and I never for a minute regret my children, I love them dearly and cherish my time with them. So with that all said lets begin! My then girlfriend and I met when we were 16 and just instantly clicked. We had everything in common, we had a very similar sense of humour and we loved doing everything together, conquering life together and just being in that first love bliss that didn’t change at all for over 8 years, we had ups and downs but at the end of the day we had each 

A lot of incredible responses here (I've read them all as of right now). No need to repeat them although kudos especially to Jacob VanWagoner (that PHD comic is right on target), Mira Zaslove, Janice Schwarz, Rab Letham and Jason Silverstein's answers below, among the many other great ones here. My first (currently only) child is now 2.5 months old, so it's still early, but with that disclaimer safely out of the way I'll happily share my current experience: 1. Nobody tells you what it will be that will hit you the hardest in those early first weeks because everybody's "hardest" is different. We 

They don’t tell you, when the labor ends, and the last supportive words of encouragement have finally resulted in the birth of your child…as you lay there out of breath, sweat laddened hair plastered to your face, the beating of your heart so loud in your ears, will gradually begin muting everything else. No beeping heart monitor, no cheerful exclamations, because without realizing it, until you hear him take his first gasping breath of life, you’ve been holding yours. Now the ooohs and awwws of family and nurses play distantly in the background because all you’ll hear is the sound of his cry. 

I have 8 children - 4 girls and 4 boys - and yes, they are all mine.  Once this round of rather close birthdays completes, they will be 26, 22, 20, 18, 16, 14, 5, and 3. also have 3 grandchildren, so I have been doing this for over half of my life, and I have heard most things by now.  In fact I have probably heard both sides of most things.  But I will share a couple that I don't believe I have heard anyone else say. First, no one told me about the strong thread of animosity that exists towards people (and most especially mothers) of many.  Having a big family is challenging and demanding but  

I've read through so many of these answers and I'll tell you the answers to what no one told me. I fully expected it to be hard. I think most people do, just don't expect it will be as hard as it ended up being for them. I deal with severe chronic pain and I never thought being a mom was possible. So hard was what I prepared for. I also expected the fear of something bad happening. That fear can wake you up in the night and fill you horrible images that you never wanted to imagine. I knew bad things could and do happen. I also knew that we remain eternally optimistic that we will be spared that 

I don't know if my observation is true for women, but I'm pretty sure that it is for most men. We men like dramatic situations that allows us to be heroes. We want to prove our love for our children in a single dramatic incident, which in turn also gives us the opportunity for a great story. "Remember that time where that drunk driver almost hit our daughter and I hauled his ass out of the car and held him down while you called the police? That was awesome!" Or perhaps it could be a conflict with another parent who has a child that bullies my child or pretty much whichever circumstances that allo 

What is the weirdest thing a girlfriend has done to make sure you were not cheating on her?
What should I do? My GF is saying that either we get married or she will dump me. We have a 7-year relationship but I'm still not ready to get married. I love her but she is leaving me unless we arrange a wedding in the next 3 months.
Every relationship gets to a point where you decide to get married or break up. Both of you need to break up. I was in your girlfriend’s shoes. Thankfully I wasted 2, not 7 years of my life with a guy. Those types are never serious nor ready for that level of commitment but too scared of being alone. Same thing; had the DTR with him. Later he surprised me with a beautiful proposal, but shortly after, the engagement was extremely stressful; nothing changed. One day he’s like yes let’s get married and next day oh I’m not sure. It was exhausting. Wedding planning helped me get away from that stress  

Been married several times and I’ve got to give you two ends of the spectrum. On one hand, marriage is for suckers. I mean you’ve been with her for 7 years. What have you not done that you can only do in a marriage? File joint taxes? Guarantee each other’s inheritance? Visit in the hospital? Get on the other’s insurance plan? All stupid reasons to get married. You mentioned something about different countries? Immigration is actually a good reason to get married. Other than that, a cynic would say it sounds like she’s got other plans for you or your fortunes. He’d say “If I was in your shoes, I’ 

My grandma had a saying for this. “Shit. Or get off the pot.” If you don’t know that you want to marry a woman after 7 years (!) of being in a relationship, then you need to figure out your mind and fast. I told my (now) husband after less than a year of dating that I was going to have to make a job decision in the next few months. I needed to have a firm decision from him on whether or not we were going to get married or not before I decided to stay where we were living at the time or move back to be closer to my family. I was not staying without a ring on my finger, or at least a firm propos 

Your gf said that to you? You mean your “girlfriend”? 7 years, and she's still your “gf”. Wow! Seven years she's been acting like your wife, you've been treating her like a wife. Sleeping in her bed each night, nursing you through sickness, washing your clothes, sucking your dick…. 7 fuckin' years you've been sucking the youth out of her and you don't respect that woman enough to ASK HER to honor you by becoming your wife.., and she wants to get married. She should have left you a long time ago. You are abusive and self-centered. If after 7 years you “are not ready”, then you really need to give her 

I had a fiancé just like you. He wasn’t ready after many years, almost 7. I one day got sick of his not being ready to just grow up and figure out what he wanted in life and I left him. Two years later (after being with HIM for 7) I was not only married, I was pregnant. No joke. So all these years later, I am happily married to someone else with a child. Coincidentally, my ex-fiancé lives 7 blocks from my new house. We stayed friends on FB, and I got a little concerned about the fact that we both live in the same small town. I looked up his address, wanting to be sure I wasn’t going to run int 

Wow this sounds familiar. I also had a 7-year relationship, in which she wanted to get married and I “wasn’t ready to.” I have to say, your girlfriend is being pretty kind, respectful, and vulnerable to express her needs to you. My girlfriend simply got frustrated, and ended the relationship. In fact, I think most women would just leave. What you have to understand is that your girlfriend loves you, but she also has important life goals which include marriage and probably family. These are very important to her. What you should ask yourself is “Why am I not ready?” For me, there were some important as 

This is a tough &amp; hard question to answer since so many variables can affect you &amp; your decision so I’m just going to try and do this on a basic and “Man to Man” kind of talk. As you’ve said, you have a 7 year long relationship and I will presume that you &amp; her are “In Love” , that you both do truly care for one another and enjoy time spent with each other and consider the past 7+ years a good investment of time. You then need to ask yourself “Why am I not ‘Ready’ for Marriage”? What is holding you back ? What are you afraid of ? What else do you feel you need to do before you feel like you wil 

I knew a guy once that was in a 5 year relationship but he just wasn’t ready to “settle down”. I talked with him a bunch of times about it because he was such a nice and kind guy and the girl was the love of his life and he would only ever get married and have children with her, he said. He couldn’t explain why not now. She was patient and seemed to be okay with the arrangement though. Fast forward 6 years. Whatever barrier makes the thought of being committed so impossible to him has not diminished. She is now in her late-ish 30s and he knows she wants kids. So he tells her she should forget h 

This is such a great question and I’m so glad you made the decision to ask it. NEVER let someone pressure you into marriage! PERIOD! Marriage is a TREMENDOUS commitment and an AWESOME responsibility! If you are not ready, you are NOT READY! NO ONE should pressure someone into marriage and, quite frankly, no one should WANT to pressure someone into marriage! People who want to get married, but are with a partner who feels they are not ready, can ALWAYS leave and go meet someone else, but NO ONE should ever pressure someone into getting married! Let me offer you some thoughts. Many women and men  

Generally, I think giving ultimatums are distasteful. However, context matters, and in the context of a 7 year relationship, I don't think its particularly unreasonable. What you need to do is to be honest with yourself. Question 1: Do you want to marry her? Possible answers: No. If this is your answer, I think its obvious that you have an irreconcilable difference. Your relationship is over, maybe it even lasted too long. You have to accept this and move on, and allow her move on.Maybe/I'm not sure.

My boyfriend and I have been in love for eight years, we had sweets and quarrels, but we are still loving. This period requires long-term effort, time and sincerity. Looking back, I have these suggestions in my relationship that I want to tell you, and I hope it will help you. 1. Give each other appropriate space and trust.  You need a space to enjoy yourself, drink afternoon tea with your girlfriends or go shopping together, and boys also need time to simply play games and exercise with their brothers. You don't need to know exactly what he is doing all the time. You can sublimate yourself in thi 

This is from my (female) experience (top 5): DO NOT SETTLE: Why? Because if you do, you are telling yourself this is the best that is out there and you don’t deserve better. You are also saying, if I settle, at least I won’t be lonely, don’t have to work, can just stay home, take care of the kids, feed the pets, or finally have some financial security. Really? Ask yourself if being lonely is someone else’s problem or just yours. Furthermore, even if you settle you may still feel lonely afterwards. And what about not having to work and just stay at home? This sounds cozy, but does it take all da

I hope that I don’t come across as too self-aggrandising, but the best relationship advice that I ever received was probably from myself. I had stayed in relationship for too long with someone who treated me appallingly as she felt that she was too good for me. She also told me on numerous occasion that she was embarrassed to be with me as she felt that she could do so much better and to twist the knife she told me a lie story that everyone had said the same to her. I’m no psychologist, but I should hazard a guess that this was either to mask her own deep rooted insecurities, or would say these  

Here are some suggestions that I have practiced, which are very useful. In China, interpersonal relationship can even be regarded as a science. With the change of young people's ideas in the 21st century, we are pushing China's interpersonal relationship to become more modern and more bordered. Asians born before the 21st century should attach great importance to the order of the young and the old, especially Koreans. China pays more attention to family relations, visiting each other and giving gifts on holidays. Especially Mid-Autumn Festival, Dragon Boat Festival and Lunar New Year. Chinese frien 

The most shocking realization of an idealist cinephile: Life is not like in the movies I stood there patiently waiting for love to find me, with popcorn in my hand and the heart on my sleeve.

Love yourself first.Don’t talk about your ex. Please don’t. What’s in the past stays in the past.Don’t rush things. Be slow and let time show you the next step.Never get involved in a relationship just because of pressure. Some people try to hold on a relationship until they find something better, or feel they can change the other person to fit what they want.

hi everyone. I would like to share some advice about relationships I have sum up today ,hope you guys will like it. 1. It's not age that brings you into marriage, it's love. 2. Always keep 20% mystery. Unreserved women, like a movie that has been spoiled, snuffed out the idea of letting men see the ending. 3. Cherish the boys who reason with you. Reason for you is that he is seriously planning for your future, and he hopes to create the future with you. 4. Material is not the most important factor in emotion, but it must exist. 5. Most of the pain in love comes from three expectations: He must be th 

This is what I've learnt over the past 8 years of my life Date with a purpose. Even if you're dating just to have sex, let your intentions be loud and clear. In the end the other party can never accuse you of wasting their time.Take time for yourself after a breakup. Finding another mate to help you “forget" your troubles might work temporarily but you'll only end up in furthur problems and end up hurting the other person along the way.If you know what you're looking for in a partner don't get sidetracked and date the opposite. Sure, it might work for a while but eventually all of the differenc

Women are motivated by love and feeling cherished, men are motivated by respect and feeling needed.When a woman is having a rough day and is opening up to you, don’t immediately give advice. Women open up because they want men to listen.When a woman says: “You never care”, “You never make me happy”, “You never apologize”. She doesn’t literally mean that you never do any of these, this is just how she expresses her feelings in the moment, so take it easy and don’t get defensive.Men sometimes demand the right to have some space from time to time and not to continuously express their feelings whe

This was a long time ago when I was still young and always got caught looking at girls. Like father like son I guess. One day I was staring at this girl who is now my fiance and decided to go talk to her and I just directly told her that she looks fine as hell today and she was a shy girl and she just turned red and said thank you. I told her “did you like when I told you that?” and she just nodded. I told her “honestly I like you more than other girls here, you actually look cute” she turned even more red and I told her goodbye. My friend just stared at me and said “did you seriously just say 

My husband cheated on me and I decided to forgive him. We just found out that the woman is pregnant and now my husband wants her to move in with us. Should I support him?
I’ve been that other woman, the one who got pregnant. That was nearly 30 years ago, and I have a different perspective on the whole situation than I had at the time. Wife, get the hell out of that marriage. Your husband might, on some level, love you, but he does not respect you. If you stay with him, you’ll be putting up with this kind of behavior until he’s too old to get it up. You will never be able to trust him. As you cling to him, hoping to save your marriage, you are wasting time—time that you could be spending in a good relationship. I’ll bet you’re worried you’ll never find anyone els 

You have gotten some great answers already. Since I have been in a similar situation I will add my little bit. I discovered that my husband was cheating, and told him I wanted a divorce He said that his dream had been to bring his mistress and her children to our country to be able to alternate living with ’his two families’. I realized I had no idea who this man that I had been married to for 20 years was. He told our children that he found me ‘old fashioned’ for not even wanting to entertain the idea. And then my world went from being a quiet suburban life as a bureaucrat and married mother o 

“Support him” in this plan? Probably not. I think your order of prioritization of well-being should be: the babyyourselfyour husbandyour husband’s girlfriend and co-parentSo, what is best for the baby? The baby will need loving adults to take good care of it, both in the sense of nurturing it and paying for its upbringing. Would you like to help parent a child? If yes, then talk to its biological parents — your husband and his girlfriend — about what role they would like you to play in this child’s life. What are they offering you? If you would not like to raise a child, then it’s certainly bes 

…No, unless you really, deep down on your heart don’t mind… …He’s trying to save money like a “two for one.”…Raise two families in one household so he wouldn’t have to buy a separate home…You know like the most classic case of having your cake and eating it too…What a cad!… …My dad took out a loan to fly a gorgeous 27 year old Korean girl to our home because she was not allowed on the free military aircraft, when I was around 8 and my younger sisters were 7, 6 and 4… …I was so naive…As pretty as she was, I still at the time thought he, being Christian and bighearted, was bringing a refugee from a 

My husband cheated on me and I decided to forgive him. We just found out the woman is pregnant and now my husband wants her to move in with us. Should I support him? This is such a sad and incredibly devastating scenario — both to you, the wife, and the (possibly unknowing), definitely trusting other woman who is in an affair with him. She was quite possibly lied to. Perhaps, it would be easier for all of you if your husband provided and paid for, housing (an apartment) and hired help for the woman (who is pregnant with his child out of wedlock) as he is actually still legally married to you, hi 

I first discovered evidence of my ex wife's dishonesty when I was using her laptop one day; my monitor had cracked and it was being replaced. I was 27 during these events. While I was buying books on Amazon, an instant messenger tab popped up on the screen from one of her ex-boyfriends asking how her day was going. I recognized his name because a year earlier he tried to harass me on Myspace (back then, Myspace was as big as Facebook is now) when our relationship was getting serious. Then i decided to look deep into it, i picked up her cell phone which she pass worded all of a sudden without my  

Good morning…..My first response to you would be “ Are you crazy or out of your mind?” But I've been attracted to someone toxic like your husband and know how we omit reality for the dream state they put us in or the dream state we have put ourselves in. If he wants her to move in to YOUR HOME, it's because he sees her, has discussed the move with her and pretty much can bet you will be amenable with having another woman push you out of your own home. He is no longer yours…..he belongs to her body and soul, until he walks into some venue and meets a hot blond; then she and the baby will be hist 

“My husband cheated on me and I decided to forgive him. We just found out that the woman is pregnant and now my husband wants her to move in with us. Should I support him?” It depends. What does your boyfriend think of this? My husband told me that he didn't want to be with me anymore so I started seeing someone else. All of a sudden he's telling me he wants to work things out, should I tell him about the other man? In May 2019 you were pregnant with 3 weeks to go. Yet you had a baby in March 2019. Color me impressed: I just gave birth to a girl two months ago. My friends and family have always  

If your question is serious, the answer is entirely dependent on only one thing. Your goals for the rest of your life. You have a choice here, and I might add it's a strategic moment, one of those moments where the decision you make has profound and often are irreversible implications for the remainder of your life. Is your is your goal for the rest of your life Journey, to be one of learning, growth and expansion? If the answer that question is yes, then you should provide absolutely no support for this absurd proposition, and seriously reevaluate your husband's intent for the rest of his life 

An unequivocal and emphatic NO. Indeed, it’s hard to understand why you are contemplating the possibility. Looking ahead, at some point in the near future, a child will arrive, who invariably will become the centre of attention, as will the mother. You will then be irretrievably relegated to number 3. You already are at number 2, by dint of his amazingly self-centred request to keep his mistress in your house). You would be allowing to have you husband have his cake and eat it (twice). The quality of your relationship with him will diminish, as will your self-esteem. Your husband could easily st

Always keep 20% mystery. Unreserved women, like a movie that has been spoiled, snuffed out the idea of letting men see the ending. 3. Cherish the boys who reason with you. Reason for you is that he is seriously planning for your future, and he hopes to create the future with you. 4. Material is not the most important factor in emotion, but it must exist. 5. Most of the pain in love comes from three expectations: He must be th 

This is what I've learnt over the past 8 years of my life Date with a purpose. Even if you're dating just to have sex, let your intentions be loud and clear. In the end the other party can never accuse you of wasting their time.Take time for yourself after a breakup. Finding another mate to help you “forget" your troubles might work temporarily but you'll only end up in furthur problems and end up hurting the other person along the way.If you know what you're looking for in a partner don't get sidetracked and date the opposite. Sure, it might work for a while but eventually all of the differenc

Women are motivated by love and feeling cherished, men are motivated by respect and feeling needed.When a woman is having a rough day and is opening up to you, don’t immediately give advice. Women open up because they want men to listen.When a woman says: “You never care”, “You never make me happy”, “You never apologize”. She doesn’t literally mean that you never do any of these, this is just how she expresses her feelings in the moment, so take it easy and don’t get defensive.Men sometimes demand the right to have some space from time to time and not to continuously express their feelings whe

This was a long time ago when I was still young and always got caught looking at girls. Like father like son I guess. One day I was staring at this girl who is now my fiance and decided to go talk to her and I just directly told her that she looks fine as hell today and she was a shy girl and she just turned red and said thank you. I told her “did you like when I told you that?” and she just nodded. I told her “honestly I like you more than other girls here, you actually look cute” she turned even more red and I told her goodbye. My friend just stared at me and said “did you seriously just say 

What was the best relationship advice you ever got?
My boyfriend and I have been in love for eight years, we had sweets and quarrels, but we are still loving. This period requires long-term effort, time and sincerity. Looking back, I have these suggestions in my relationship that I want to tell you, and I hope it will help you. 1. Give each other appropriate space and trust.  You need a space to enjoy yourself, drink afternoon tea with your girlfriends or go shopping together, and boys also need time to simply play games and exercise with their brothers. You don't need to know exactly what he is doing all the time. You can sublimate yourself in thi 

This is from my (female) experience (top 5): DO NOT SETTLE: Why? Because if you do, you are telling yourself this is the best that is out there and you don’t deserve better. You are also saying, if I settle, at least I won’t be lonely, don’t have to work, can just stay home, take care of the kids, feed the pets, or finally have some financial security. Really? Ask yourself if being lonely is someone else’s problem or just yours. Furthermore, even if you settle you may still feel lonely afterwards. And what about not having to work and just stay at home? This sounds cozy, but does it take all da

I hope that I don’t come across as too self-aggrandising, but the best relationship advice that I ever received was probably from myself. I had stayed in relationship for too long with someone who treated me appallingly as she felt that she was too good for me. She also told me on numerous occasion that she was embarrassed to be with me as she felt that she could do so much better and to twist the knife she told me a lie story that everyone had said the same to her. I’m no psychologist, but I should hazard a guess that this was either to mask her own deep rooted insecurities, or would say these  

Here are some suggestions that I have practiced, which are very useful. In China, interpersonal relationship can even be regarded as a science. With the change of young people's ideas in the 21st century, we are pushing China's interpersonal relationship to become more modern and more bordered. Asians born before the 21st century should attach great importance to the order of the young and the old, especially Koreans. China pays more attention to family relations, visiting each other and giving gifts on holidays. Especially Mid-Autumn Festival, Dragon Boat Festival and Lunar New Year. Chinese frien 

The most shocking realization of an idealist cinephile: Life is not like in the movies I stood there patiently waiting for love to find me, with popcorn in my hand and the heart on my sleeve.

What makes a man fall in love with a woman?
Man falls in love with a woman because.. His number desire the need and want for approval and validation. This can mean many ways of showing that; and I can mention some. That she shows him affection, she behaves in a feminine way in recipocrating his flirtatious ways and she shows vulnerability to him. She makes him feel special, needed, wanted in her life. When she sees him or hears from him she is excited, it feels like she has been waiting to hear from him. He is wanted. He is needed. He is loved. How so many women especially young women fail in this first one is crazy. You’d not believe 

From the answers here I say most men have certain (sometimes bizzare!) fantasies, but actually have no idea - or are unwilling to tell - what actually makes them ‘fall in love’ with a women. My answer is not pretty. I am going to tell the truth about men regards women they ‘fall in love’ with and marry.  Basically, a man falls in love with the woman who can best fulfill his EGO. But every man has different ego needs. One man may prize women who are high maintenance, as this fulfills their ego need of being the partner of someone who is high status (which can lend him the status which he lack on hi 

Well, in some cases, utter and complete stupidity and naiveté. In other cases? Physical appearance. In yet others, personality, actions, and the whole kit n kaboodle. There are millions of differing reasons, but ultimately, there are some basic things that do tend to do it. Here's a few of the more usual suspects: Old fashioned gender roles: The woman makes the man feel like a man, virile, like a good provider, and an overall good person. It can feel like a natural high, and who wouldn't want a feeling like that as often as possible, eh? Excuse me for a minute. My wife needs me to open a jar of

Women are sensitive. Some it is really difficult to assure of a lady is truly in love with you or not. Girls are so coquettish so not every man can manage to recognize their mood at first view. Anything that arouses Interest in a person also attracts her. If a girl holds her kook on to you for long, then you can defiantly talk about her interest. Although it's too early to tell about falling in love. Love can make a girl do tyle o clothes, change interests. You must appreciate such a girl who can change her lifestyle just to impress you. A woman in love will be looking for an opportunity with  

just Penned down some incomplete thoughts … “A man falls in love when he feels like he could be a super hero with you in his life. When he feels accepted, appreciated and understood, and knows he can make you happy…he will be yours. Oh…and throw in that he thinks you’re hot!”- Booby Palmer – 1- Men are captivated by the whole Package - Men are often enamored by the entire woman. Someone more than Complete + , Or they call her A+ woman in Brocode drinks..

It was late night, her lines dug deep in her face, the light from the crackling fire told us she lived a long life, with lots of pain because he back so arched, and she was alone, and has been for other half of her 80 year life on planet earth. And she suddenly flowed with the gems of how she screwed up with not just one man of her life but THREE. It was like a man falling in love with her escaped her everytime she thought she got him. Moment she discovered the answer to her question, she added.. “It was far too late. I was now in my 50s and ended up in a fast world you young ones now live in, bu 

Why Man Fall in Love with a women? That seems to be the elusive million dollar question. But … it’s not so elusive. Women can’t always see it clearly because women typically have a goal from the start, the goal being to get a commitment and have that rare, once in a lifetime, loving relationship. But what causes men to fall in love with a woman? What makes one woman special and unique? He feels seen and appreciated for who he is. Men are absolutely starved for appreciation. You may not realize it because he probably doesn’t come right out and ask for it, but you’ll see the effect it has on him whe 

Well, I will answer this question from a woman’s perspective. I mean to say what a woman thinks can make a man fall for her. Certainly, men-women falling for each other is a natural instinct. But, when it comes to the point of what makes a man fall in love with a woman, the touchstones are as follows: How she looks and makes herself presentable in different occasions at different times of the day in different outfitsHer intelligence that glows in her eyes and makes her different from the rest of the worldHow she at the same time be tender and rough, whatsoever and whenever requiredHer emotional

Recently a famous Hollywood actor married a pornstar. She still has her profile on the Hookup Site. When asked what made him fell in love in an interview, here are his reason below.  Honesty: Someone that is brutally honest. Not someone that just tells you what you want to hear. Even if it jeopardizes the relationship itself, honesty goes a long way. Trust: There can’t be love with no trust. Trust is earned and not given away. And from my experience, it’s hard to find. Loyalty: Someone that goes through your life in good and bad. Has your back in the bad times, not just the good. They support you  

1.Women as the safest place for him to go on the planet Your arms, eyes, and lap, those have to be a refuge for him. If you become the safest place on the planet for his heart’s secret needs; he will never leave. 2. Women who make them feel like they matter Appreciate him when he goes out of his way to buy a gift or provide you with much-needed emotional support. Tell him that he made a difference in your life. 3. Women who accept them for who they are If you can encourage him to be his authentic self, it makes you extremely approachable and lovable. When he feels safe and comfortable, he’ll open u 

Why do breakups happen even after being together for years?
Oh, people split up for all kinds of reasons—most of these are not the kind of answer you’re looking for tho: cheating, lying, abuse, addiction… etc. I’m guessing you want to know why two people who love each other and have an otherwise functional relationship end up going their separate ways. Let me tell you a bit about my story. Approximately one year ago I ended a long (nearly 10 year) relationship with a man I loved (and still love) deeply. We had gotten together during the endings of our respective marriages and had a two year courtship; getting to know one another and falling deeply in lo 

In a lot of cases, it’s specifically BECAUSE the people involved have been together for so many years. Almost every one of the cases I’ve seen where long-term couples break up follows the same progression of events from the moment they meet until the bitter end, and it all has to do with an increasingly intolerable familiarity with one another. I think Chris Rock put it best when he said that when you first meet someone, you’re not really meeting THEM, you’re meeting their representative. The reason for this is obvious: when you first meet someone you’re interested in, you want to impress them  

Falling in love is a mix of luck (meeting this one spiritual match that could have been a continent away but just happens to be on your bus, then having the chance to spend enough time to realize you have a connection) and something like magic (good or bad?). The process of being in love creates endorphins that quite literally drug you into loving that person more than you ever thought was possible. Even if you’re aware of the fact that you’re under the influence of one of the most powerful mind altering drugs ever known, you can’t decipher where the “real” person ends and the drug induced awe 

I broke up with a woman to whom I had been married for 19 years. I learned what to do with my pain and now I have a mission to help others who are going through the same thing I did. Here is an earlier post on the subject (not knowing how to post references on Quora, I will repost my experience below, which includes what I did about it and have the delight to help others do as well): I had spent nearly twenty years with a woman I was sure I was destined to be with. We could complete each other's sentences, and it seemed she could even read my mind. Hours and hours we spent talking together abou 

Like everything in life, it’s simple. It was time for it to end lol There’s nothing you or anyone else could do to avoid it. Life has its own timing, and you best go with the flow of life. These questions are all human mind, based on human ignorance. Why did it end. Because you weren’t meant to be together, that’s why lol Can’t break it down more simply than that. You were not meant to be together. You came together, you taught each other what you needed to teach each other, and it ended. Or it ended, because you needed to learn something from the ending. Either way, it ended, because it was su 

Because unconditional love is dead. In fact, it never existed in the first place.  When most of our lives we are flooded by cheesy Hollywood movies and cheap Valentine Days commercials about what true love should be, you can often find yourself running around in a haze trying to pick up the broken pieces of your self-esteem like someone just spilled a bag of Skittles all over the floor. It’s a classic scenario: Boy meets girl.Girl meets boy.Their eyes meet and sparks instantly light up. But wait!There are trials to be passed. There are other people involved. There is drama. There are a lot of u 

Had to go anonymous on this one simply to protect those involved and because it will happen in a few weeks.  ​This is a merry-go-round. One of my favorite rides on the playground as a child and what would later become a metaphor to describe the world how I looked at life being in love with someone I care about deeply. My girlfriend and I have been together for 11 years now. Since we were 15 and in high school. We just clicked. Being in an interracial relationship — in the South this is still a big thing — we saw a lot. Her parents disowned her and didn't speak to her and me for the first 7 years  

It happens for Good. I was in a relationship for nearly 7 years before we broke up. I was head over heels in love with that person. I used to dream about him always. Talk about him always. Think about him always. I was crazy about him. The only thing I ever wanted in life was to be with him.  This is what happens when you fall in love at 16..! Adolescence makes you dumb at times. I was not just in love, I was dumb enough not to notice few things. Because I was so blinded by Love.  I turned 20.. Yes, the excitement reduced. But, there was more to it now than just teenage excitement. There was Value t 

You need to understand the cycle of the sweet drama you call as a Love Affair. You most certainly were doing good if not great before you even met them. Once you started getting closer your mind made up all kinds of reasons to make you believe there is a huge void in your life and this is the person who fits in perfectly. You put in all efforts to make them happy keeping yourself secondary. At first instance you were attracted to their looks, voice, intellect, etc and did not stop to think about your compatibility with each other before pursuing a serious relationship. All you wanted was to som 

There's just one simple reason. People change. They don't remain the same always and therefore, you can't expect their affection towards you to stay the same. I fell in love when we were in class 8th and proposed to her the next year. We were best friends and after a lot of effort and persuasion from my side, we ultimately got into a relationship. Life was just as good as it can get. We were among the toppers of the class and had a lot of fun together. But we were totally opposite. She was an extrovert and loved to socialise while I being an introvert. It caused a lot of problems but we managed  

What's a shallow reason you wouldn't date someone?
Literal Shallow Reason: I wouldn’t date a girl - and have actually rejected at least three in real life - if she had any kind of height requirements. Being my shortness is my biggest - and primary - insecurity, it just kinda pisses me off when a girl tries to think of you as an inferior man just because you’re not tall. And in this case, I mean girls who try to say “I won’t date guys who are [X height] or less” or “I won’t date a guy who isn’t a minimum of [X height] and up,” even if I happened to fall under the “just barely passing” grade for these women. These girls have typically said a 5′10 

Early kids. That’s as shallow as it gets, probably. If there’s a group of potential partners that I try to avoid most, it’s people having those. Not because I hate kids (can’t say I love them either, but still). Not because I hate parents in general (when adult and steady person decides to go that way, voluntarily and all consequences consdered, it deserves only respect). No - this is mostly about young mothers, who got too drunk while being merely a student in the high school and ended up pregnant, while not being mature enough yet to have a bonsai, not to mention raising a human being. Or alte 

They don't smell good to me. For the past twenty years - since I started dating - I've just sort of shrugged at the idea of having “chemistry” with someone. Every time I've been attracted to people, I've been attracted to their mind and heart first, and physical attraction inevitably follows. Until about a year ago, I never dreamed that I could love someone and not be attracted to them. It simply never happened. About a year ago, I was forced to reevaluate my sexuality. This wasn't the first time - I identified as asexual until I was 18 - but since then, I've considered myself bisexual, though m 

Reasons are specific to my own desires. Posture Presentation is most important, and seeing a woman walk in the room with high heels, chest out, and head high is sexy and appealing. It would be virtually impossible for me to pursue a woman with forward-head posture. If I marry you, you run the risk of having your neck permanently damaged at a young age if you continue to sit with crappy posture.  Narcissistic women I like to stay away from “Instagram fitness models,” and women who take plenty of selfies. While a fitness models body may be close to perfect, I would rather stay away from the trouble it  

Here are few reasons for not dating you : (List would be updated as the need arises) :p I would never date a guy who is irresponsible. I want a guy who is responsible and serious about his professional as well as personal life.I would never date a guy who dominates me all the time. I love my own freedom.I would never date a guy who is addicted to all sort of bad habits like drinking, smoking, etc.I would never date a guy who do torture me with anykind of verbal or physical abuse.I would never date a guy who have an orthodox thinking, who do belive in superstitions, etc.I would never date a guy w

i am a guy and its the opposite gender whose superficial demands in a guy and stories of unsuccessful relationships and compromises made me a person who has started hating opposite gender. first of all i am quite good 6feet+ plus a muscular aesthetic freak guy who can open his shirt in crowd. But i am not like that ,i dont believe in showing off my skin. I am shy kind of person when it comes to representing myself. And has many other eligibility criterion to meet any superficial standard and demand. But i seek the person who is very normal,down to earth, having family values,traditional kinda p 

People who are passionate about some political topic. It just gives me a bad vibe. They may be fine about everything else, but once they get the bit between their teeth about some hot topic and get that fanatical flame in their eyes and voice, I start feeling like I’m being dragged into a revolution of sorts, like I’m expected to choose sides, and I get uncomfortable. I was once on a dating site and this guy started chatting me up. He was very nice and all, and said he was Azeri, and asked if I’d ever been to Azerbaijan. I said I hadn’t, and he started describing how nice it was and how I shoul 

I suppose this seems shallow, but I wouldn't date someone who chose a career based on trivial pursuits - one that defines success through popularity or making money (both of these things serve no thing and no one). Basically, this includes any job that requires “selling oneself” or a career where one has “clients.” While I get that not everyone has the choice to go to college or the skills and intelligence necessary to work in certain professions that would connect one to a public thing, the choices we make about how we earn a living say a lot about who we are. In other words, a person who choo 

I certainly wouldn’t date someone who feels that liking the things that I like is the key to success. I also would not date someone who did not have a striving for knowledge, regardless of their perceived intelligence. The first. When I have met new people who are plainly interested in me romantically, one thing I have noticed is that, upon hearing I like something, they will say they do as well- irrespective of what they actually enjoy. This makes for an instant descriptor of those who are so fearful that people will not like them, that they instead subsume their self-worth to the foreign ideas 

My most shallow reason would be if they weren’t from my reservation or in our term, an outsider. This single reason kills many birds with one stone. Ruling out billions of women for the few hundred in my reservation means: Religion: They’ll have the same religion as I do. As worshipers of the Canyon Goddesses, we go on personal pilgrimages and it could cause problems in a relationship with an outsider. Why not have someone who will go on these pilgrimages with you or at the very least understand? Overweight: You won’t find many overweight people in the reservation. We have a culture that thrives 

What is wrong with relationships in today's society?
As somebody who is dating I can answer this: People see relationships as dangerous. Many of my male friends are terrified of relationships because men get the rough deal. A man can marry a woman, get a divorce, and women get half his stuff. Women can screw men over with child support, not letting the father see their children, and get abortions even if the men want the child.Women worry about relationships, too. Many of my friends were served divorce papers from their husband who found younger women and then refuse to pay child support or see their kids. It's heart-breaking to see fathers actin

What is wrong with relationships in today's society? We can answer this question from a number of perspectives. I’ll limit myself to two perspectives I have experienced and felt myself in order to remain authenticity in my answer. *I am assuming you imply the loss of monogamy and the infidelity in modern relationships. If I’m wrong just let me know and I’ll edit my answer to properly help you ;)* The first perspective from which I wish to answer is overstimulus: Nowadays sensory stimuli are everywhere. Especially when we look at the percentage of ads with nude content has gone up dramatically. A r 

Today’s relationship is not really a genuine relationship.  Based on my observation in the West, the individualizing culture has reduced relationship into mere: 1. Individual taste and 2. Consensus between two individuals (best described by the sexual revolution which later results in the perception of marriage as a “risky and traumatic bargain”, and one should always remain “free and open”). In the East, the socialist form of culture has reduced relationship into: 1. Individual obedience and 2. Cultural Demand forcing individuals to have relationship in which there is no love. In both cases, rel 

“I date guys when I am bored…” “Oh I just want to eat, I'm hungry…” The first statement came from a female “friend” and second is a statement I hear very often from females. **I am speaking from the perspective of a guy so fuck off feminists who try to make everything about women.** Okay, that out of the way,.. let me continue It is fucked up on so many different levels to date anyone out of pure boredom. “Oh I have been feeling like a piece of shit these days, so let me see how many hearts I can totally annihilate… mmm sounds like a great adventure!! This one is going to be an exciting one!!!” Now t 

People go into relationships with the expectation they will fail. Why bother being my genuine self. Why bother admitting my own faults. Why bother being vulnerable with my partner. Statistics suggest relationships have an inevitable shelf-life - right? It’s so much easier to forfeit personal accountability than it is to look inwardly and apply any constructive introspection. Furthermore there is a defeatist and pessimistic mentality that directly hinders ones potential to even explore the possibility of intimacy. Conflicting ideals that manifest in the following way: “I just want to be happy, I deserv 

In today's society we have like 4 different generations and each of these has different views and understandings about relationships. Different problems and different approaches. I'll try and generelize my views. People fear getting into commitments nowadays. My friends are constantly telling how they are free to enjoy there youths as much as they can. The tainted picture of living your bestlife is to go clubbing every weekend, drinking with your friends. “ooh you stay at home with your boyfriend, y'all ain't living”We've established so many rules around on dating that we've actually corrupted 

There are a lot of symptoms for what is wrong with relationships nowadays, such as divorce, lack of commitment, MGTOW, and disfunction generally. The reasons for this seem to me to be caused by: We live longer (our great grandparents had a life expectancy of about half of ours so we feel we have more time to try things (i.e. we socially ‘mature’ slower, stay in education longer, start work later, buy a home later, have kids later etc). Unfortunately, our reproductive cycle hasn't kept up with our social changes so we are still bound by our biological clocks. Hence why we have an increasing numb

Relationships, like every other aspect of human life, has been affected by markets. We now have what is called the dating market. Young people who date are great. They can use tinder and things like that, and then buy lots of alcohol, and expensive meals, and spend a lot of money on clothes and so on to try and impress each other. Wanting a family is seen is being controlled by the patriarchy. Dating, and ditching people to find someone else, better looking, superficially attractive, moving on to the better offer on the market, keeping yourself looking ready, and being ready to spend a lot of money 

My experiences might shed a light on the subject. I had a girl dump me precisely because of the “Greener Grass”. There was no marriage proposal, but we dated 2 years and I took her daughter as my own. In my experience, I learned is something very often happens and even now, while single I see the trend why many women are single mothers or just single. Bad judgment calls and then desperate attempts to get back with the one ex who was actually perfect for them. Men are idiots in our own right to be sure. I am far from perfect. Nobody is perfect. But then again, most people lack emotional maturity,  

Well, there are already many great answers on this topic on this post, so I fear that I won’t be able too add too much of value here. Let’s split “relationships” into romantic relationships and non-romantic relationships.Romantic relationships in today’s society are difficult for many reasons, but a couple of significant ones, I believe, are that many people between the ages of say 20 and 35 (imprecise numbers because I don’t have the data in front of me) have come up in households that have been bitten by the divorce bug. This event from a child’s perspective, especially at a young age, can  

Why after ten months of no contact do I still think about her? I have done a good job of moving on but sometimes memories pop up out of nowhere and the hurt returns. I still love this person, and I don’t for the life of me know why.
I can always sense when my partners are cheating or something just isn't right. With no proof or any indication at all, I can just feel it. I'm always right, why do I just know when something sketchy is happening?
Have you ever been stalked? What's your story?
I’ve written this before but I feel it’s worth repeating as it may save someone’s life. My sister was nearly abducted by a pretty dangerous, demented character. Tracy was nineteen at this time. On the way to the photo shoot she noticed a white van kind of following her, changing lanes, driving behind but always staying close. Arriving at the studio, she pulled into the lot and noticed the van slowly kept on driving, but very slowly. Luckily, she glanced at the license plate. She has what is called Eidetic Memory. The number was easily remembered. Tracy went into the studio and spent most of the  

Yes, I have, several times. The first, and scariest for me, was my first serious boyfriend. He was very attractive, very persuasive, played football/lifted weights, and had zero problems doing whatever he felt like doing to get whatever he wanted. He was two years older than I was in age and about a decade older in manipulation. While he never hit me, he would pick me up and throw me over a shoulder, or drag me, or pick me up and shake me until I was dizzy, or lie to me to isolate me from other people, or lie to them to get them to tell him what I was doing when he wasn't around.  He also had no 

Luckily I have never had a male stalker (that I currently know of). Enough awkward, obsessive-ish types in my life up until I was roughly 19-years-old taught me not to get to know guys all that well right off the bat. It became second nature to avoid letting a guy friend from class or dorm notice me in the library or out and about - even when I knew they were normal and never acted strangely or showed interest. It just became a knee-jerk thing: I just hated the idea of once again initiating or welcoming friendly behavior with males that unbeknownst to me translated as a different kind of friend 

Since I’ve moved, I’m finally ready to talk about this online. I don’t really care if this offends him. I always thought that if I got a real-life stalker, it would be the result of Quora. I have a few people that make sock puppet accounts and have messaged me every day on Instagram, but this was a whole other level. I met him at work. He seemed nice enough and really shy. I think I was sat next to him and we became instant friends. I made it clear from the get-go that I wasn’t looking for a relationship. I did confide in him some red flags about my relationship, which in hindsight, was a mistak 

Yes. Although I didn’t realize it was stalking until almost a year after it began. I used to be friends with a boy in middle school. Let’s call him E. And I say friends, but we were more like acquaintances; talking briefly in passing and walking to a corner together on our way home. I stopped talking to him after he went to high school, since he was a grade ahead of me. Nothing bad had happened between us. We just lost contact. Fast forward two, almost three years later. I had just started dating my boyfriend and he and E happened to be friends. We reconnected and eventually developed a friendsh 

The guy who was stalking me ended up with a broken nose and a dislocated knee cap. A bit of an explanation for that dramatic introduction. I worked third shift at a convenience shift (11 PM - 7 AM). At that time I was a 20 year old single female. I worked the cash register while my co-worker (also female) worked in the food service area. One night this gentleman came in and made multiple comments to me about how beautiful I looked, how he would love to have a young woman like me, how I would make a perfect wife for someone. Overall creepy comments that shouldn’t be made to someone you just met wh 

God. Yes. I did. Let me tell you, it’s not a fun experience. With the advent of dating apps it’s easier than ever to meet other gay people, even if sometimes you give away too much information without realizing. I had moved to Lisbon and for the first time in my life I decided to install a dating app, believing that i’d meet interesting people and make new friends, maybe even start a relationship. Since I had so little friends in Lisbon this seemed like a very nifty solution to my social life.  None of that came to pass (except in some rare few occasions like that one time I went on a date with a G 

Literally searched for this question to share my experience. This was written real time in my notes before editing it and copy pasting it here. My experience was not half as bad as some of the answers written here but enough to scare a fourteen year old. Happened here in Singapore. Just now a guy in blue shirt who has dwarfism that is way shorter than me (but obviously older based on the face) was staring at me damn creepily. I looked right into his eye and he was even smiling creepily and still staring. What is scary is that he looks so old and he is shamelessly staring at me in front of a MRT 

Yes a few times throughout my life. I experienced my first stalking incident in high school when an anonymous male would call me and tell me where I was, occasionally he would call the residence I was hanging at just to rattle me. Eventually after some selective choice words from a colorful and influential friend of mine it stopped. I worked at a local mall once upon a time and being a friendly human I always said hello to the mall staff, one of the caretakers there was a male a little older than me, very shy but very nice. We never spoke much other than pleasantries. One day the mall owner who  

I’ve been putting this answer off for over a year but I think I’m ready to share the full story…  2010 was when it all started. A cousin, whom I didn’t know at the time had an obsession with me, asked for my email so that he could share religious teachings. Being 13 and naïve, I did just that; gave him the email address and watched it all unfold like a movie. I trusted him, I mean after-all, he was my blood? Initially the conversations were innocent, he taught me about my religion. I appreciated it. But it turned sinister when he became obsessive. “Reply back to me right now!” And I did… “Reply back t 

My girlfriend is mad at me for "not standing up for her.” She accidentally spilled her drink on a girl in the club. The other girl threw her drink on my girlfriend and her boyfriend shoved me. I grabbed my girlfriend and we left. What should I do?
Yeah, she has every right to be mad at you. Because only a real man will start a fight with drunk, possibly high,  aggressive  strangers with hair trigger tempers  in a charged, highly public atmosphere like a club where everyone there is preening in one way or another, rather than walk away in shame unscathed from the crazy.  &lt;sarcasm off&gt; Your girlfriend sounds like an immature dumbass who thinks that only real men worthy of her attention are aching to get into fights  every time someone does something she doesn't like. That little girl has to realize this isn't the Knights of the Round Table he 

Some time ago a friend of mine was drinking in a bar with his wife when she accidentally did the same as OPs girlfriend and spilled some drink on another girl. The girl she spilled the drink on went crazy and just like in OPs story the boyfriend appeared to see what was happening.  My friend says his biggest mistake was not to just turn and leave immediately,instead he stepped between the boyfriend and his wife to try to de-escalate things. While he was talking to the boyfriend (who it turns out was pretty chill) the crazy girlfriend smashed a glass in his wifes face.   The boyfriend dragged the 

Wow, I'm sorry this happened to you both. What an unfortunate accident that turned into violence and hate toward you and your girlfriend. That just stinks. Look, there was nothing you could have done in that situation. You had to diffuse the anger, and get the heck out. It most certainly could have escalated.  What I'm interested in knowing is how you handled things after you left?  Let me let you in on a little secret. Women still want to be protected by their boyfriends/husbands. It is deeply ingrained in us. If nothing can be done during an escalated situation (which clearly here was the case) 

I am sure you must have heard of the line “Humans are social animals”. The key word here is ANIMAL, we are all biologically programmed in such a way that the male of our species will majorly if not always have the urge to physically support our female counterparts at times of conflicts Let me give a small story from the time i was dating around a decade or so ago, so me and my girl had this thing that we used to have daily dinner after work at the same restaurant which was mid way to both our work places, we didn’t go there for any particular food or beverage but just for convenience. This was  

Of course you made the smart and gentlemanly move. Absolve thyself of all guilt now.  Listen, kid, had you and your woman confronted the aggressors, you both could have ended up badly beaten, damaged physically and financially, ashamed and in jail -- and for what? It's not like you were defending your nation against the friggin' Germans? Engaging in a pointless fight with some drunken nightclub knucklehead trash is not worth any outcomes, even total victory. That only makes you an equally large idiot.  And by the way, your girl sounds like a big, immature baby. If any girl asked me to fight for  

You should leave that girlfriend. What your girlfriend needed to do was to apologize profusely to the couple and ask if there was anything she could do to make up. And you needed to do that too. I don’t know, maybe you did the right thing. But she definitely has a character problem. But it is a sad shame that the immaturity of the couple played out the way it did, and even sadder that your girlfriend is upset with you. Her emotionalism unfortunately betrays her character. She should be upset with herself for causing the whole thing, not with you. I would leave her. Sooner or later she will get  

There are a lot of good answers here. I took a few months of martial arts instruction a few years ago. The instructor was like a slightly smaller version of Shaq. The man could definitely fight. He could have killed me in five minutes with one hand. He said, "It's always better to walk away than fight. You fight only as a last resort, to keep from being killed or maimed." He said that when he lived in Amsterdam, he had returned to his apartment one day to find an intruder in the act of stealing his TV. He said "Hey, so what's up?" Rather than try to demonstrate his fighting skills on the guy, he 

Tell her that brawling with strangers in bars is an excellent way to wind up dead or terribly, life-alteringly injured, whereas apologizing profusely and leaving as soon as humanly possible is the best strategy for continuing to live without injury, criminal charges, or getting sued by anyone for whatever you messed up or broke as you were being mauled by the drunk, violent thug she wanted you to "stick up for her" to.   **Most bar brawls involve either knives or blunt instruments.** They very rarely involve only bare fists, common sense, or fair play. What you see in movies and on TV is call 

Learn Martial Arts, and tell her, that the best weapon, is walk away. Even if you had a gun, the best thing is to walk away. You can be the best fighter treatened by the weakest fighter, just walk away. You did what you should do. Martial artists never fight, do you ever see them fighting? ever? on yt anywhere on street? no, they escalate the situation with words. They are confident enough to stand up for them self, and you wont intimidate them by shouting or looking at thier eyes, but they will handle it calm staying strong. Even if the martial artists could knock the other oponent out, he ju 

You did the right thing. The question is why doesn't your girlfriend understand that, and what, if anything, can you do about it. I can only speculate as to why your girlfriend doesn't understand. Perhaps she's seen too many Sylvester Stallone movies. But clearly she thinks that her honor was at stake, and her honor was more important than getting out alive. Honor of that sort is an expensive concept. A lot of people have died or been hurt in pursuit of honor. And for what? So that other people will admire them?  The problem is that most people don't respect that kind of honor any more. Most peop 

Why do nice guys get rejected even though they're being nice?
10 Reasons Why Good Men Get Rejected By Women even though they're being nice. 1. He tries to get her to like him before she is attracted to him One of the biggest mistakes that good guys make with women is that they try to be “liked” by a woman for being a good man or for being a nice guy, instead of making her feel sexually attracted to him first. For example, He might “be there” for her when she is feeling down or going through a challenging time in life, be a friend, listen, be very courteous and generous all because he is hoping to be liked as a person. Instead of attracting her with his confi 

Wow! So many answers here end up attacking the “Nice Guy” syndrome itself, like it’s some kind of great sin to have. Most of these answers make the exact same argument. It’s like a herd mentality of an angry mob which has descended on some poor soul who just asked politely why girls seem to reject him. They all make the assumption that men cannot be nice to a woman in general, unless he’s some devious shmuck out to deflower her. So I’m going to deviate from the ‘mainstream’ and try to answer the real question. If you are one of the men who wanted to ask this same question, then I hope my answer 

I will be blunt, because I know that a lot of guys struggle with this: It does not matter how nice you are if we aren’t also drawn or attracted to you somehow, and not beating or raping women is not enough to qualify as “nice”. You might be willing to consider any woman who isn’t overtly rude or downright hideous as a potential partner, but unfortunate for you, that just isn’t how most women work. Most of us – and quite a lot of men, for that matter – aren’t the least bit interested in anyone unless that person has some positive traits that actively draw our attention and trigger a spark of att 

Nice guys get rejected because they are being nice for all the wrong reasons. But before I continue, let me explain the difference between a genuine nice guy and a fake nice guy (this is the type of nice guy people look down on and women reject): Genuine nice guys do nice things because they want to do them and not to get something in return for it. Fake nice guys do nice things because they learned that being nice is how they will be loved and validated by others, specifically women. As a result of this, they will become a people pleaser, lack self-confidence and self-respect and become a pushove 

Well, what do you mean by nice guy?, If you are telling me being respectful, being nice to someone is an astonishing quality. And girls will just swoon over you, to be in romantic relationship, just because you are nice, you are polite, you respect women, and all the other good qualities you think you have. Then my friend, you are very wrong. And when I say wrong I don’t mean to say that you just shun all those qualities and become something despicable. However, let me share one anecdote with you, happened with one of my friend in college. You will get the message which I want to convey. So, the 

It’s not that guys who certainly can be a nice fellow — and are Not classic “a-holes” — can’t get a date and are always rejected. That’s not what this is about. What you’re referring to is: Why do Mr. Nice Guys(tm) always get rejected by the cuter girls, and still many girls who aren’t terribly cute? Because Mr Nice Guy is a guy who’s, well, Nice. That’s the first adjective that comes up. It may not be terribly accurate, though. But as you point out — he’s being nice, though! Well, “Nice” is the first word that comes to mind to a gal when asked what she thinks of Guy X, when she’s not drawn to h 

How about this sentence… “Why don’t you want to go out with me? I’ve been nice to you.” Or how about this one…. “Why don’t you like nice guys like me?” Or this one…. “We’ve been friends for a long time. Why don’t you want to go out?” Or…. “Go out with me. I’m not like other guys. I’ll treat you nice.” Or this one that totally left me in shock…. “We’ve been through so much. I’ve been there for you all this time. Why won’t you go out with me?” I’ve met a lot of “nice guys” and they’re not that nice. I don’t know who started this “nice guy” thing to get girls, but it’s a stupid idea…just like the idea that 

Arpit Ghosh has the best answer so far. So I am going to come at this from a different direction. When I was in my teens and early 20’s I was a “nice guy.” Respectful, polite, Mr. Nice Guy. I married at 23. Two years later, my wife, who suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder, decided to start fucking a co-worker while I was in night classes at law school. “I did it to get back at you for not paying attention to me,” she said. I was devastated. My world collapsed. We separated and then divorced. This experience strangled the Mr. Nice Guy in me. I had a good relationship with my mother, so 

When I started reading answers similar questions around early 2018, I remember being offended by statements such as “They don’t owe you a relationship” and “With nice guys if you’re referring to spineless guys…”. I began to gradually accept certain things that seemed objectively true and decided that I should not worry about certain things that seemed absurd. Let’s think through it. Firstly, you need to first figure out “Do nice guys get rejected more often than bad guys?” and reframe your question based on that. Then, I’d suggest you to start thinking by first asking yourself, what all do you  

It's pretty simple, really: being nice isn't a quality that's all that rare in people and you're 1 in every 2 people if that's you're core appeal. That's short and sounds mean but hear me out: if the core aspect of your appeal is that you're nice then I worry for how you can keep someone interested. Nice is what you are to the cashier at the supermarket, your waiter or waitress, the man wheeling a buggy with his toddler inside or the woman in a power suit on her way to work: it is the bare minimum we should expect from an average, mentally well person. It's expected - or rather, it should be. Who

Every time I bring something up to my husband that I don’t like, he says “if you don’t like it, leave.” I always approach him very kindly. Never confrontational. Do you think he really wants me to leave or is he just being a jerk?
OMG my husband used to say that a lot. Exactly as you say, each time I bring up something he doesn't like - such as help around the house by paying part of the bills, cleaning up after himself, being a supportive husband by action and not by name only. His phrase was, “if you don't like it, then go and get a divorce” When he started saying it at the early phase of our marriage, I used to be scared. Then I would back track and tried to calm him down - until the next time - because the issues never go away. 7 years on, things haven't changed. He still does not contribute financially, physically and 

Depends on the ask “Always kindly - never confrontational” Irrelevant Husbands respond to respect and disrespect. Want to turn your husband’s heart from you - treat him with disrespect. Want to drive him into the arms of another woman? Disrespect him in public. If your complaint is to help around the house and pull his own weight - call his bluff My mom said this to me on occasion- but I understood it in sarcasm not reality - most people who use this - intend sarcasm But on serious matters, husband/wife matters - sarcasm is a cheap shot - call him on it And don’t let him get away with treating you with 

It sounds like a coping mechanism to me and, yes, he’s being a jerk. That said, take him up on his threat. Pack a bag of essentials without him knowing: wallet, id, passport, and such, anything that is valuable to you and that you would not want to lose. Put that bag in storage ether in a locker or a trusted friend. The next time he acts out and spews the classic “if you don’t like it, leave.” . . Get up, smile, and say “Okay.” Grab car keys and head for the door and the car. Go spend the night with parents or your trusted friend. If he’s JUST being a jerk, he’ll burn up your mobile trying to rea 

Kindly nagging is still nagging. My guess is that you have done this for a very long time and the love he feels for you is not that strong. And I would dare bet that you don’t feel much love for him either. The key to getting someone to change is through love. Saying a negative thing in a kind way is not love. Not in the least. My guess is that he is not a moron, so don’t treat him like one. So how do you fix things? When you the same thing over and over again, you create a rut. The longer you do this thing, the deeper the rut becomes and the harder it is to get out of the rut. My guess is that y 

Sounds like he’s just being a jerk, but he’s the only one that knows how he really feels. He’s not giving you a safe space in your relationship to have an opinion. It sounds like it is his way or the highway and that puts you in a tough predicament because it doesn’t give you a chance to change anything in your relationship that isn’t working for you. He has no reason to change his behavior because you’re putting up with it and he gets to do whatever he wants. The next time he tells you to leave, I would call him on his bluff and go. He’s going to be in for a big surprise when you actually leav 

Who cares what he wants, he is being a jerk. Me I would the next time he says that go start packing. I would empty out the closet and the drawers. If he says “what’s for dinner?” I would say very sweetly, “what ever you prepare for your self while emptying out the medicine cabinet. If he wants to know where you are going shrug and say why would you want to know about that You want me gone. He has learned he can shut you up by saying that. He has you walking on eggshells terrified to discuss anything. He has trained you to not do anything he doesn’t want you to do, and yup that includes talking 

It seems to me there should be an explanation for his response. He may feel he tries hard to be a good provider and husband in his mind. He may feel you have not noticed well enough that he is at least that. If the only approach you make toward him is when you find something you do not like, his reaction is not likely to be positive. It seems hard to believe however that you would not have been forthcoming somewhat in showing your appreciation for the efforts he had made. Perhaps, it the sense of being hit out of the blue with something negative that provokes his response. Generally, though it 

I married for the first time at 48 years old. I thought it was heaven. For the first 6 weeks. Then, the divorce threats started. Every little thing turned into “maybe we should just get divorced” from him. It doesn’t take long before you are both on that bandwagon. Marriage is supposed to be a promise of stability, not an opportunity to create never ending emotional turmoil. It just made life so uncertain. Nothing could be planned… no trips or concert tickets. Because the “let’s get divorced” theme was always there. I remember reading in a Cosmopolitan Magazine, somewhere in my 20’s, in one of  

For your husband to speak to you that way after you kindly want to discuss an inssue means he doesn’t think he should treat you with respect and doesn’t want to. That, in and of itself, is a big problem for a marriage. In fact, I would work on that before trying to address any other individual issue you may be referring to because without mutual respect, those other things cannot effectively be addressed and the love will die. I’m not a relationship expert but I think people in a relationship should acknowledge that they (like all humans) and imperfect and be open to what their partner has to  

I’m sorry but your husband is an immature dick. He is getting off on a power trip every time he says that to you. Relationships are never perfect. They need constant evaluating, fixing, tweaking. That’s why people say marriage is work. Being willing to change, compromise, and meet someone halfway is part of being married. Listening, discussing, and making decisions together is what two mature people do. A mature person doesn’t say “If you don’t like it, leav,e” when approached with a problem to be solved. Call him on his bluff. Check into a hotel for a week. Have a lawyer send him a letter. Kids?  

What do I do when my fiancé is more interested in a bond with his dog than with his unborn child? I’m almost 7 months pregnant and I can count on one hand how many times he’s touched my stomach and he finds talking and reading to the baby weird.
How do you get back at a narcissist?
The most respectful way, if you are kind to others and don't want that behavior to rub off on you, you should just not contact that person. Leave them alone. They are already suffering internally, more than you can perceive. What they think about themselves is said to you because the weight is too heavy to bare for them but that is not valid justification for abusive or negative behavior. If anything, getting them back just makes their illness worse and also makes you feel like the problem they say you are. It's a lose-lose. If a child misbehaved, do you put them in time out so they can sit and  

The best way to get back at a NPD is to move forward with your life, use this experience to learn about yourself on a deeper level, work at getting good with who you truly are and never look back. No contact. Here’s the thing - when I first began to unravel the unruly mess I was when things ended with my N, I was MAD. I was furious and all I really wanted was to scream at him to slap his face to step on his toes I really wanted to let out the rage inside of me and I wanted him to see it hear it feel it. I wanted to start a Scarlet Letter for N’s worldwide. I wanted his name on a billboard in ev 

Jamie, the best way to get back at a narcissist is, first of all, if you are carrying a load of anger for injuries you sustained, harboring grudges, including.. (the payback sort of grudges), continuous thoughts at the back of your mind consuming your every thought on “how can I make this still work?” to bargain with your anger issues….thinking.. that you still love this person sooo much that you will gladly let it go for another chance at making this relationship right or making it work. I am so sorry honey, it is not gonna happen..say and if it does, it’s only borrowed time before you find y 

I would suggest not doing it. For one nothing good will come of it. Why do ask? How do you know you are dealing with a narcissist? I ask because the term is loosely tossed around by people upset about the way a relationship ended or one considered toxic. The person is hurt and feels like they didn’t the closure or answers they want. There will be no honest heart to heart. There will be no accountability shown. When really if you are involved with a narcissist just go your own way even if you feel like doing something it won’t make you feel better. I guess that would be the best advice and reve 

How to get back at the narcissist, how to get even or make them feel how they made you feel or at least give them a dose of their medicine! If you had a penny for every time a survivor asked themselves that question you would be rich for sure! The problem is if your talking about getting the narc to be EMOTIONALLY hurt or negatively affected by something you do to them then there is only one way to do so! In my opinion the best way to make a narc feel totally defeated by you and actually feel emotional pain, shame, embarrassment, guilt or maybe even regret is to FULLY expose them to the world or 

Be very careful trying to get revenge. A narcissist is a pro at games of revenge, has had many years of practice at deceit and manipulations, and has little or no boundaries. Even if they seem angry, they enjoy these games. Anything you do will be used against you to make you look like a crazy, bitter ex. Hell, half the time you'll be blamed for stuff you didn't do. Someone said post a bad review of him online. if he gets a bad review, he's gonna blame you whether you wrote it or not, and then he's gonna show everyone that bad review and tell everyone that his crazy bitter ex wrote it because s 

All these people are gonna tell you this “no contact, move on and don’t look back” jazz, and it’s true, but they don’t understand. There is a difference between getting revenge vs getting justice. Revenge is petty and to be honest won’t bring a lot of satisfaction long term. Getting justice is different though. It’s more than just you. It’s how this person violated not just you, but basic humanity. It’s something beyond you. This monster is going around smashing up other peoples lives with no freaking consequences. No freaking blotch on their record. No trace of their abuse not just of you, but  

By far the most effective way is to act like the hurt never happened, and you are simply not bothered by what they did. That is a tall order when you are screaming inside, but it is devastating to the narc if you can pull it off. The narc is meant to control you and your world, and you are supposed to be destroyed if you ever split. Act like you are not, and the narc’s world order is upset. So if you ever bump into him or her, instead of glaring or bursting into tears, you give a big smile and a cheery wave, then sail on (things to do, places to go). You will leave behind a very confused narc. 

This question is actually a “catch 22” as consciously “getting back” at a narcissist is actually feeding their supply. You see, you wouldn’t feel the need to exact revenge if they hadn’t already succeeded in “winning” by upsetting you. It’s the functional equivalent of telling your childhood buddy his mom wears army boots after he denounces yours. Fucked up, right? Welcome to the world of narcissism! Where absolutely nothing is as it appears &amp; lying, cheating, manipulating &amp; controlling are the rules of this sick &amp; twisted little mind game.

I am getting angry right now. What should I do if a Korean girl wont date me? 😡
I am getting angry right now. What should I do if a Korean girl won’t date me? Calm down and leave the girl alone. There’s probably a reason why the girl doesn’t want to date you. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t find you attractive. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t like your personality. Don’t take it personally; after all, not everyone’s going to like you back. But if you only want to date a Korean girl because she’s Korean, then that’s just plain stupid and it makes sense why Korean girls wouldn’t want to date you. You’re literally fetishizing them.

Imagine a woman who you are not attracted to in the least, demands that you date her, and when you decline her offer, she becomes furious with you. You would think she has serious anger issues, you would be thankful that you avoided her, and she is a jerk. EVERYONE of us has liked someone who has not liked us back. Each of us has the right to say no, no matter how much the other wants to date. That is how it goes. You will survive this. Show her kindness, leave her alone, and take some time to figure out why you are becoming so angry. Only you can change this about you. It is not their responsib

Learn to not! It's most likely an indication you are not happy with yourself. Let her go! Now work on yourself. You are mostly perpetuating the problem. You need to be okay with rejection and be positive about what you do have. A bit of gratitude goes a long way. So what do you enjoy doing? Go do that and let her go! There is more to life that expecting people to fall at your feet. Just you do life and if she doesn't want to part of it..her loss.

mainly, no offense but this is true, Korean families only look in people for their good jobs and their income like a doctor who makes 200k a year they would consider them a part of the family but if not you know they would just dump you. This wouldn’t be an offense because back then in ancient times they believed in power and wealth also mainly if you don’t respect the Korean culture and you don’t approve the eating ways then that’s a reason why they don’t want to date you and also begging and forcing wouldn’t make it better. 83 views4Cynth GrehnAnswered March 23, 2021Originally Answered: I am lonely and angry.

I saw this question/vent like for so many times and I assume you’re the same guy. Listen, first off if you’re in Korea, try dating apps. It might probably help you. I mean don’t lose hope, there are many half Koreans and half black kids so there might be a chance you’ll find one. It might take some luck or timing as well. Or just accept that korean girls might not be for you but you can try other asian girls that has a resemblance of korean girls features.

I wonder if you’re that same guy that said that Korean girls won’t date them because of their race? I guess it’s because those girls that you are desperately wanted to date refuse to date you because they’re scared of you or because they’re not ready to be in an interracial relationship with you. 69 views · View upvotes4AnonymousAnswered March 23, 2021Originally Answered: I am lonely and angry.

Have you ever had a Quora crush?
Yes I have a major crush on a Quoran, though he is not much popular here. I would have written this answer without being anonymous, but uff he hates these type of answers and he would have reported it instead of replying. Okay so lets see who he is: He is 17 years old and he also has a blog.He lives in a stubborn illusion.He has such an unique name, so much so that many people report his account for fake name, ugh.His name means ‘Curious’.I don’t know why actually does he mentions himself as lunatic, I don’t think he is.He doesn’t follow back or reply to messages generally.

I also use "she" and "he" to make this a little easier on the eyes but at least one, maybe more, of the stories below are same-sex stories. Case #1: She reads his answers and she is blown away. He is funny, outgoing, and he has something to say about most anything. When she clicks on his profile she discovers he's in the same state as her, only a 45 minute drive away. She messages him for coffee and coffee happens. Smart guy, smart gal. More driving, more meeting, then a weekend at his pla

What would you think if a friend (with whom there was never even a kiss) invited you to dine with her, reiterating several times that if it was late you could sleep with her?
Since I foster open communication among my social circle, including making safe spaces for people to say what they feel and to accept and give rejection gracefully, I would think that my friend is saying exactly what she means. Friends can have meals together. I frequently dine with my friends, even one on one (well, I did before the world ended, anyway). Friends can also crash at each other’s houses, especially if it’s late and there are long drives ahead. All my friends have a standing offer to crash at my place if they come all the way out to where I live and it gets too late to drive home, a 

Well I think maybe she's saying IF ITS TOO LATE YOU CAN SLEEP AT HER PLACE not necessarily with her UNLESS SHE VERBALY SAID “sleep with me in my bed “ So I'd think since your “friends “ who've never shared a kiss together I'd think right away (unless she clearly said “sleep with her in her bed “ I'd think she simply means To SLEEP IN HER HOUSE but necessarly with her in her bed .UNLESS SHE STATED IT IN A CLEAR AND CONSISE MANNER .Your default idea should be UNLESS SHE WAS CLEAR ABOUT WHERE YOUR SLEEPING IN HER HOUSE .the default would be since your friends Is that yes you'll sleep in her home  

I can see how that might be a bit confusing. I would say what she meant, but didn’t say clearly, is that if it gets late you can just stay over night there at her place. That’s it, sleep, nothing more. Think of it as, woman lingo. The moment I read what you wrote she said to you I thought of the many times my female friends have said the same to me. It’s a figure of speech not a sexual come on if that’s what you’re wondering. I’m 99.9&amp;1/2% sure that I am correct in my interpretation. HOWEVER, there’s always that possibility that I could be wrong. If I am wrong and it gets late &amp; you decide to sta 

If there are no romantical feelings towards each other, I would think that she just wanted company for dinner and it f I was to sleep with her, then nothing sexual would be taking place ( because that IS possible) and also by her saying repetitively about sleeping with her, I would think she had too much to drink. However, sounds like she has been thinking about you as more than a friend for some time. She mentioned you sleeping with her lots of times because she was trying to read your thoughts on sleeping with her. If you weren't such a gentleman, you prolly could have slept with her that nig 

Sleep with her or sleep over? How long have you known this friend? Has she ever flirted with you or do you get the feeling she's into you more than just a friend? Is she attracted to men? If she said “sleep with me" than that's pretty direct. There's nothing to read into because literally that means sleep with me. If she said sleep over then I could see why you maybe reading into her words. The friends I have invite me &amp; my husband out to their place and typically if it's late they let me know that if we wanted/needed to we could spend the night. (Unless they already specified otherwise that I c 

I’d think that sounds nice. I like my friends, and a dinner and a sleepover sounds lovely, I’d almost certainly accept unless the proposed time crashed with something else on my calendar. There’s some chance that the friend in question has an interest in adding a romantic and/or sexual component to our relationship, how likely this is would depend on what our interactions are like in general though, and not just on this one invitation. (Whether or not I’d want that, would depend on how I feel about the friend in question.) Generally there’s open and honest communication between me and my friends 

Not crash — but sleep over? I think she’s far More than hinting that she like-likes you. Here’s a litmus test: Pretend you have a serious GF. Would your GF be OK with any of this? No? Why? Yah, becomes quite clear, doesn’t it? :) She’s asking for you to sleep in the same bed with her — she invited you over to eat at her place 1-on-1. She obviously at least wants you to want her. If you’re attracted to her — make a move. It’s quite obvious. She’s putting the writing on wall quite clearly. Which means even if she’s kinda screwball in the head and just wants you to want her and if/when verified she’ 

Maybe she's conveying something sneakily, but as a male, please don't take first step without getting a straight answer. Especially in such affairs which requires getting close. If she likes you, wants to go wild with you, let her say it straight forward. If you like her, express it in a friendly, decent and in a safe way possible.

Like many of the other posters, there’s a lot of gray area here that would need to be elaborated on to give the best answer. From what I can glean, you are just good friends and she wanted to have dinner with you and politely offered you a place to stay in case things got too late or you had too much to drink. Very few women I know, and I mean I don’t think I’ve ever met one, repeatedly tell me that if it gets a little late they’re going to “sleep with me” meaning have sex with me. Trust me most men would drag the evening out as long as possible. I’m pretty sure she was just referring to letti

OMG my husband used to say that a lot. Exactly as you say, each time I bring up something he doesn't like - such as help around the house by paying part of the bills, cleaning up after himself, being a supportive husband by action and not by name only. His phrase was, “if you don't like it, then go and get a divorce” When he started saying it at the early phase of our marriage, I used to be scared. Then I would back track and tried to calm him down - until the next time - because the issues never go away. 7 years on, things haven't changed. He still does not contribute financially, physically and 

Depends on the ask “Always kindly - never confrontational” Irrelevant Husbands respond to respect and disrespect. Want to turn your husband’s heart from you - treat him with disrespect.

It sounds like a coping mechanism to me and, yes, he’s being a jerk. That said, take him up on his threat.

Put that bag in storage ether in a locker or a trusted friend. The next time he acts out and spews the classic “if you don’t like it, leave.” . . Get up, smile, and say “Okay.” Grab car keys and head for the door and the car. Go spend the night with parents or your trusted friend.

Kindly nagging is still nagging. My guess is that you have done this for a very long time and the love he feels for you is not that strong. And I would dare bet that you don’t feel much love for him either. The key to getting someone to change is through love. Saying a negative thing in a kind way is not love. Not in the least. My guess is that he is not a moron, so don’t treat him like one. So how do you fix things? When you the same thing over and over again, you create a rut. The longer you do this thing, the deeper the rut becomes and the harder it is to get out of the rut. My guess is that y 

Sounds like he’s just being a jerk, but he’s the only one that knows how he really feels. He’s not giving you a safe space in your relationship to have an opinion. It sounds like it is his way or the highway and that puts you in a tough predicament because it doesn’t give you a chance to change anything in your relationship that isn’t working for you. He has no reason to change his behavior because you’re putting up with it and he gets to do whatever he wants. The next time he tells you to leave, I would call him on his bluff and go.

It seems to me there should be an explanation for his response. He may feel he tries hard to be a good provider and husband in his mind. He may feel you have not noticed well enough that he is at least that. If the only approach you make toward him is when you find something you do not like, his reaction is not likely to be positive. It seems hard to believe however that you would not have been forthcoming somewhat in showing your appreciation for the efforts he had made. Perhaps, it the sense of being hit out of the blue with something negative that provokes his response. Generally, though it 

I married for the first time at 48 years old. I thought it was heaven. For the first 6 weeks. Then, the divorce threats started. Every little thing turned into “maybe we should just get divorced” from him. It doesn’t take long before you are both on that bandwagon. Marriage is supposed to be a promise of stability, not an opportunity to create never ending emotional turmoil. It just made life so uncertain. Nothing could be planned… no trips or concert tickets. Because the “let’s get divorced” theme was always there. I remember reading in a Cosmopolitan Magazine, somewhere in my 20’s, in one of  

For your husband to speak to you that way after you kindly want to discuss an inssue means he doesn’t think he should treat you with respect and doesn’t want to. That, in and of itself, is a big problem for a marriage. In fact, I would work on that before trying to address any other individual issue you may be referring to because without mutual respect, those other things cannot effectively be addressed and the love will die. I’m not a relationship expert but I think people in a relationship should acknowledge that they (like all humans) and imperfect and be open to what their partner has to  

I’m sorry but your husband is an immature dick. He is getting off on a power trip every time he says that to you. Relationships are never perfect. They need constant evaluating, fixing, tweaking. That’s why people say marriage is work. Being willing to change, compromise, and meet someone halfway is part of being married. Listening, discussing, and making decisions together is what two mature people do. A mature person doesn’t say “If you don’t like it, leav,e” when approached with a problem to be solved. Call him on his bluff. Check into a hotel for a week. Have a lawyer send him a letter. Kids?

How do you get back at a narcissist?
The most respectful way, if you are kind to others and don't want that behavior to rub off on you, you should just not contact that person. Leave them alone. They are already suffering internally, more than you can perceive. What they think about themselves is said to you because the weight is too heavy to bare for them but that is not valid justification for abusive or negative behavior. If anything, getting them back just makes their illness worse and also makes you feel like the problem they say you are. It's a lose-lose. If a child misbehaved, do you put them in time out so they can sit and

Jamie, the best way to get back at a narcissist is, first of all, if you are carrying a load of anger for injuries you sustained, harboring grudges, including.. (the payback sort of grudges), continuous thoughts at the back of your mind consuming your every thought on “how can I make this still work?” to bargain with your anger issues….thinking.. that you still love this person sooo much that you will gladly let it go for another chance at making this relationship right or making it work.

I would suggest not doing it. For one nothing good will come of it. Why do ask? How do you know you are dealing with a narcissist? I ask because the term is loosely tossed around by people upset about the way a relationship ended or one considered toxic. The person is hurt and feels like they didn’t the closure or answers they want. There will be no honest heart to heart. There will be no accountability shown. When really if you are involved with a narcissist just go your own way even if you feel like doing something it won’t make you feel better. I guess that would be the best advice and reve 

How to get back at the narcissist, how to get even or make them feel how they made you feel or at least give them a dose of their medicine! If you had a penny for every time a survivor asked themselves that question you would be rich for sure! The problem is if your talking about getting the narc to be EMOTIONALLY hurt or negatively affected by something you do to them then there is only one way to do so! In my opinion the best way to make a narc feel totally defeated by you and actually feel emotional pain, shame, embarrassment, guilt or maybe even regret is to FULLY expose them to the world or 

Be very careful trying to get revenge. A narcissist is a pro at games of revenge, has had many years of practice at deceit and manipulations, and has little or no boundaries. Even if they seem angry, they enjoy these games. Anything you do will be used against you to make you look like a crazy, bitter ex. Hell, half the time you'll be blamed for stuff you didn't do. Someone said post a bad review of him online. if he gets a bad review, he's gonna blame you whether you wrote it or not, and then he's gonna show everyone that bad review and tell everyone that his crazy bitter ex wrote it because s 

All these people are gonna tell you this “no contact, move on and don’t look back” jazz, and it’s true, but they don’t understand. There is a difference between getting revenge vs getting justice. Revenge is petty and to be honest won’t bring a lot of satisfaction long term. Getting justice is different though. It’s more than just you. It’s how this person violated not just you, but basic humanity. It’s something beyond you. This monster is going around smashing up other peoples lives with no freaking consequences. No freaking blotch on their record. No trace of their abuse not just of you, but  

By far the most effective way is to act like the hurt never happened, and you are simply not bothered by what they did. That is a tall order when you are screaming inside, but it is devastating to the narc if you can pull it off. The narc is meant to control you and your world, and you are supposed to be destroyed if you ever split. Act like you are not, and the narc’s world order is upset. So if you ever bump into him or her, instead of glaring or bursting into tears, you give a big smile and a cheery wave, then sail on (things to do, places to go). You will leave behind a very confused narc. 

This question is actually a “catch 22” as consciously “getting back” at a narcissist is actually feeding their supply. You see, you wouldn’t feel the need to exact revenge if they hadn’t already succeeded in “winning” by upsetting you. It’s the functional equivalent of telling your childhood buddy his mom wears army boots after he denounces yours. Fucked up, right? Welcome to the world of narcissism! Where absolutely nothing is as it appears &amp; lying, cheating, manipulating &amp; controlling are the rules of this sick &amp; twisted little mind game.

Yes I have a major crush on a Quoran, though he is not much popular here.

He is funny, outgoing, and he has something to say about most anything. When she clicks on his profile she discovers he's in the same state as her, only a 45 minute drive away.

When dating, especially online dating, how do I bring up that I'm a loser? I want to be honest but I don't want women to be turned off by the fact that I don't have a lot going for me.
What would you think if a friend (with whom there was never even a kiss) invited you to dine with her, reiterating several times that if it was late you could sleep with her?
Since I foster open communication among my social circle, including making safe spaces for people to say what they feel and to accept and give rejection gracefully, I would think that my friend is saying exactly what she means. Friends can have meals together. I frequently dine with my friends, even one on one (well, I did before the world ended, anyway). Friends can also crash at each other’s houses, especially if it’s late and there are long drives ahead. All my friends have a standing offer to crash at my place if they come all the way out to where I live and it gets too late to drive home, a 

Well I think maybe she's saying IF ITS TOO LATE YOU CAN SLEEP AT HER PLACE not necessarily with her UNLESS SHE VERBALY SAID “sleep with me in my bed “ So I'd think since your “friends “ who've never shared a kiss together I'd think right away (unless she clearly said “sleep with her in her bed “ I'd think she simply means To SLEEP IN HER HOUSE but necessarly with her in her bed .UNLESS SHE STATED IT IN A CLEAR AND CONSISE MANNER .Your default idea should be UNLESS SHE WAS CLEAR ABOUT WHERE YOUR SLEEPING IN HER HOUSE .the default would be since your friends Is that yes you'll sleep in her home  

I can see how that might be a bit confusing. I would say what she meant, but didn’t say clearly, is that if it gets late you can just stay over night there at her place. That’s it, sleep, nothing more. Think of it as, woman lingo. The moment I read what you wrote she said to you I thought of the many times my female friends have said the same to me. It’s a figure of speech not a sexual come on if that’s what you’re wondering. I’m 99.9&amp;1/2% sure that I am correct in my interpretation. HOWEVER, there’s always that possibility that I could be wrong. If I am wrong and it gets late &amp; you decide to sta 

If there are no romantical feelings towards each other, I would think that she just wanted company for dinner and it f I was to sleep with her, then nothing sexual would be taking place ( because that IS possible) and also by her saying repetitively about sleeping with her, I would think she had too much to drink. However, sounds like she has been thinking about you as more than a friend for some time. She mentioned you sleeping with her lots of times because she was trying to read your thoughts on sleeping with her. If you weren't such a gentleman, you prolly could have slept with her that nig 

Sleep with her or sleep over? How long have you known this friend? Has she ever flirted with you or do you get the feeling she's into you more than just a friend? Is she attracted to men? If she said “sleep with me" than that's pretty direct. There's nothing to read into because literally that means sleep with me. If she said sleep over then I could see why you maybe reading into her words. The friends I have invite me &amp; my husband out to their place and typically if it's late they let me know that if we wanted/needed to we could spend the night. (Unless they already specified otherwise that I c 

I’d think that sounds nice. I like my friends, and a dinner and a sleepover sounds lovely, I’d almost certainly accept unless the proposed time crashed with something else on my calendar. There’s some chance that the friend in question has an interest in adding a romantic and/or sexual component to our relationship, how likely this is would depend on what our interactions are like in general though, and not just on this one invitation. (Whether or not I’d want that, would depend on how I feel about the friend in question.) Generally there’s open and honest communication between me and my friends 

Not crash — but sleep over? I think she’s far More than hinting that she like-likes you. Here’s a litmus test: Pretend you have a serious GF. Would your GF be OK with any of this? No? Why? Yah, becomes quite clear, doesn’t it? :) She’s asking for you to sleep in the same bed with her — she invited you over to eat at her place 1-on-1. She obviously at least wants you to want her. If you’re attracted to her — make a move. It’s quite obvious. She’s putting the writing on wall quite clearly. Which means even if she’s kinda screwball in the head and just wants you to want her and if/when verified she’ 

Maybe she's conveying something sneakily, but as a male, please don't take first step without getting a straight answer. Especially in such affairs which requires getting close. If she likes you, wants to go wild with you, let her say it straight forward. If you like her, express it in a friendly, decent and in a safe way possible. Let her pick up the hint, take you to bed and take it to next level.

Like many of the other posters, there’s a lot of gray area here that would need to be elaborated on to give the best answer. From what I can glean, you are just good friends and she wanted to have dinner with you and politely offered you a place to stay in case things got too late or you had too much to drink. Very few women I know, and I mean I don’t think I’ve ever met one, repeatedly tell me that if it gets a little late they’re going to “sleep with me” meaning have sex with me. Trust me most men would drag the evening out as long as possible. I’m pretty sure she was just referring to letti

Is it impossible to find a pure girl these days?
Every time I bring something up to my husband that I don’t like, he says “if you don’t like it, leave.” I always approach him very kindly. Never confrontational. Do you think he really wants me to leave or is he just being a jerk?
OMG my husband used to say that a lot. Exactly as you say, each time I bring up something he doesn't like - such as help around the house by paying part of the bills, cleaning up after himself, being a supportive husband by action and not by name only. His phrase was, “if you don't like it, then go and get a divorce” When he started saying it at the early phase of our marriage, I used to be scared. Then I would back track and tried to calm him down - until the next time - because the issues never go away. 7 years on, things haven't changed. He still does not contribute financially, physically and 

Depends on the ask “Always kindly - never confrontational” Irrelevant Husbands respond to respect and disrespect. Want to turn your husband’s heart from you - treat him with disrespect. Want to drive him into the arms of another woman? Disrespect him in public. If your complaint is to help around the house and pull his own weight - call his bluff My mom said this to me on occasion- but I understood it in sarcasm not reality - most people who use this - intend sarcasm But on serious matters, husband/wife matters - sarcasm is a cheap shot - call him on it And don’t let him get away with treating you with 

It sounds like a coping mechanism to me and, yes, he’s being a jerk. That said, take him up on his threat. Pack a bag of essentials without him knowing: wallet, id, passport, and such, anything that is valuable to you and that you would not want to lose. Put that bag in storage ether in a locker or a trusted friend. The next time he acts out and spews the classic “if you don’t like it, leave.” . . Get up, smile, and say “Okay.” Grab car keys and head for the door and the car. Go spend the night with parents or your trusted friend. If he’s JUST being a jerk, he’ll burn up your mobile trying to rea 

Kindly nagging is still nagging. My guess is that you have done this for a very long time and the love he feels for you is not that strong. And I would dare bet that you don’t feel much love for him either. The key to getting someone to change is through love. Saying a negative thing in a kind way is not love. Not in the least. My guess is that he is not a moron, so don’t treat him like one. So how do you fix things? When you the same thing over and over again, you create a rut. The longer you do this thing, the deeper the rut becomes and the harder it is to get out of the rut. My guess is that y 

Sounds like he’s just being a jerk, but he’s the only one that knows how he really feels. He’s not giving you a safe space in your relationship to have an opinion. It sounds like it is his way or the highway and that puts you in a tough predicament because it doesn’t give you a chance to change anything in your relationship that isn’t working for you. He has no reason to change his behavior because you’re putting up with it and he gets to do whatever he wants. The next time he tells you to leave, I would call him on his bluff and go. He’s going to be in for a big surprise when you actually leav 

Who cares what he wants, he is being a jerk. Me I would the next time he says that go start packing. I would empty out the closet and the drawers.

If he wants to know where you are going shrug and say why would you want to know about that You want me gone. He has learned he can shut you up by saying that. He has you walking on eggshells terrified to discuss anything. He has trained you to not do anything he doesn’t want you to do, and yup that includes talking 

It seems to me there should be an explanation for his response. He may feel he tries hard to be a good provider and husband in his mind. He may feel you have not noticed well enough that he is at least that. If the only approach you make toward him is when you find something you do not like, his reaction is not likely to be positive. It seems hard to believe however that you would not have been forthcoming somewhat in showing your appreciation for the efforts he had made. Perhaps, it the sense of being hit out of the blue with something negative that provokes his response. Generally, though it 

I married for the first time at 48 years old. I thought it was heaven. For the first 6 weeks. Then, the divorce threats started. Every little thing turned into “maybe we should just get divorced” from him. It doesn’t take long before you are both on that bandwagon. Marriage is supposed to be a promise of stability, not an opportunity to create never ending emotional turmoil. It just made life so uncertain. Nothing could be planned… no trips or concert tickets. Because the “let’s get divorced” theme was always there. I remember reading in a Cosmopolitan Magazine, somewhere in my 20’s, in one of  

For your husband to speak to you that way after you kindly want to discuss an inssue means he doesn’t think he should treat you with respect and doesn’t want to. That, in and of itself, is a big problem for a marriage. In fact, I would work on that before trying to address any other individual issue you may be referring to because without mutual respect, those other things cannot effectively be addressed and the love will die. I’m not a relationship expert but I think people in a relationship should acknowledge that they (like all humans) and imperfect and be open to what their partner has to  

I’m sorry but your husband is an immature dick. He is getting off on a power trip every time he says that to you. Relationships are never perfect. They need constant evaluating, fixing, tweaking. That’s why people say marriage is work. Being willing to change, compromise, and meet someone halfway is part of being married. Listening, discussing, and making decisions together is what two mature people do. A mature person doesn’t say “If you don’t like it, leav,e” when approached with a problem to be solved.

                   What's love????Its a miraculous magic... You just love being in LOVE. ..So don't fall in love. ..Rise with love.  

Why does a woman who has rejected you twice say "You are the most terrific guy. Any woman would be lucky to be with you."? Why doesn't she jump on the opportunity herself and why is she BS'ing me when she knows I'm not interesting enough for her?
The first and most obvious reason is that she is trying to ease any pain of rejection you might be feeling. That's considered polite, so if nothing else, that would be enough reason. Of course, she might also be sincere when she describes you as a terrific guy and a good catch, though obviously not ANY woman would be lucky to have you. She, for instance, would not be lucky to have you — she would likely be unhappy if she was stuck with you. That doesn't mean you're not “terrific.” A man or woman can have plenty of terrific qualities and yet not be right for a specific partner. You could be kind,  

I’ve gotten that a lot in my life. In my younger days, it was a source of frustration for me, so I understand why you feel put off by it. I used to joke that I’m the perfect guy for every woman’s best friend. But I’ve actually made a number of good female friends who started out as a date that didn’t go anywhere. It is quite possible to really like someone and think they are great without being romantically inclined toward them. And I’ve found that, if I put the whole romance thing out of mind, strong friendships can form. It always hurts to be rejected, but you can reframe it in your mind as a 

She probably does sincerely believe you're a terrific guy. That part doesn't have to be BS. The second part, “Any woman would be lucky to be with you,” is BS, however. If it were true that any woman would be lucky to be with you, she would be with you, and count herself lucky. The truth is, “Any woman who is attracted to you and compatible with you would be lucky to be with you, because you would treat her well.” But she probably lacks the awareness and precision to say that, so she falls back on a cliche. A sensible person chooses a partner based on a mixture of attraction, compatibility, and q 

I don’t know you or the woman in question, so I have no idea whether she really believes you’re a wonderful guy or whether she just THINKS she’s being nice and letting you down easy. Maybe she really thinks you’d be perfect for some other girl, or maybe she’s just trying to get rid of you without causing a scene. But ultimately, it doesn’t matter. You have been given the brush off. It hurts when a woman you love doesn’t feel the same way about you. But now you know: she isn’t interested in you as a boyfriend. So, forget about that and move on. Should you be “just friends”? That’s entirely up to  

About 45 years ago, a woman to whom I was deeply attracted explained that while I was her dear friend, romance wasn’t there. She thought I was likely to be a great husband, but not for her. I was a bit wounded for a while, but shortly resumed the friendship. It’s lasted all these years. She called me yesterday and we had a nice gabfest about our spouses, our kids, and other interests. We were warm and comfortable friends. I like her husband a great deal and clearly she made the right decision for her life, and coincidentally helped me find my love. Here’s the deal: if you truly cared about this  

25 years ago I met a manic depressive, ex-speed freak, man (hereafter called §). § was (to me) as unattractive sexually as it was possible to be. I was happily “married” (not legally, but in very other way) to another man, but § and me “clicked” mentally. I introduced § to my husband - they became friends. § met a woman (¥) I befriended her. It is now 30 years later. § still rings me up once a week for “a nice chat”. That girlfriend (¥) is still his girlfriend, even if she is now 77 years old. $ is a terrific guy. Any woman would be lucky to be with him. But “sexually attractive” he is not. Even  

It’s called “letting you down easy.” There are lots of reasons why someone might reject someone, and we couldn’t possibly know her reasons. There are also reasons why she would let you down easy: She doesn’t want to hurt you. Most people would rather not hurt other people, especially is they like them.She honestly likes having you as a friend and does not want to lose that. People whine about “the friend zone,” but really, being a friend is a good thing, if you can handle it. If you can’t, well, that’s nothing to be ashamed of. It can hurt to be close to someone when your feelings are at odds.Sh

The flattering reason for this is that she's aware that you'd objectively be "a catch" she just doesn't seem to be attracted to you because attraction doesn't function as a checklist. So "It's not you, it's me!", go and find the one/s you'd be perfect for! The less flattering reason (possibly likely, since she's rejected you twice and you're still arguing about it) is that women and girls get heavily socialised not to hurt the feelings of boys and men, so this tends to mean a "No" is couched in indirect and kind terms. This is partly because they get told not to be a bitch, and partly because t 

People feel what they feel. I can objectively look at someone and say, “that person has the right kind of personality, sense of humour and ambition that I'd think they’d make a good partner”… but if I’m not attracted to them, it’s all meaningless. Either there’s a spark or there’s not. In my past I *wished* I was attracted to certain people because they would have been better choices for me but attraction simply doesn’t work that way. Attraction is involuntary. It’s not something anyone can control. She doesn’t feel it for you. She’s not BS’ing you, she’s actually complimenting you while at the sam

I am getting angry right now. What should I do if a Korean girl won’t date me? Calm down and leave the girl alone. There’s probably a reason why the girl doesn’t want to date you. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t find you attractive. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t like your personality. Don’t take it personally; after all, not everyone’s going to like you back. But if you only want to date a Korean girl because she’s Korean, then that’s just plain stupid and it makes sense why Korean girls wouldn’t want to date you. You’re literally fetishizing them.

Imagine a woman who you are not attracted to in the least, demands that you date her, and when you decline her offer, she becomes furious with you. You would think she has serious anger issues, you would be thankful that you avoided her, and she is a jerk. EVERYONE of us has liked someone who has not liked us back. Each of us has the right to say no, no matter how much the other wants to date. That is how it goes. You will survive this. Show her kindness, leave her alone, and take some time to figure out why you are becoming so angry. Only you can change this about you. It is not their responsib

Learn to not! It's most likely an indication you are not happy with yourself. Let her go! Now work on yourself. You are mostly perpetuating the problem. You need to be okay with rejection and be positive about what you do have. A bit of gratitude goes a long way. So what do you enjoy doing? Go do that and let her go! There is more to life that expecting people to fall at your feet. Just you do life and if she doesn't want to part of it..her loss.

mainly, no offense but this is true, Korean families only look in people for their good jobs and their income like a doctor who makes 200k a year they would consider them a part of the family but if not you know they would just dump you. This wouldn’t be an offense because back then in ancient times they believed in power and wealth also mainly if you don’t respect the Korean culture and you don’t approve the eating ways then that’s a reason why they don’t want to date you and also begging and forcing wouldn’t make it better. 83 views4Cynth GrehnAnswered March 23, 2021Originally Answered: I am lonely and angry.

I saw this question/vent like for so many times and I assume you’re the same guy. Listen, first off if you’re in Korea, try dating apps. It might probably help you. I mean don’t lose hope, there are many half Koreans and half black kids so there might be a chance you’ll find one. It might take some luck or timing as well. Or just accept that korean girls might not be for you but you can try other asian girls that has a resemblance of korean girls features.

I wonder if you’re that same guy that said that Korean girls won’t date them because of their race? I guess it’s because those girls that you are desperately wanted to date refuse to date you because they’re scared of you or because they’re not ready to be in an interracial relationship with you. 69 views · View upvotes4AnonymousAnswered March 23, 2021Originally Answered: I am lonely and angry.

I was aged 21 years and I had no one to call my own. But there was a 18 years old boy who gave me the respect of an elder sister. I always blind folded belived in him. I know him since he was just 12. One day during Saraswati puja I worshiped goddess saraswati and obviously I had to wear a saree, so that whole day I was wearing a saree.

I was going through a very rough time mentally and emotionally. I had just lost the best job I ever had (when the economy collapsed several years back) AND my girlfriend had just left me for another guy. I was a mess. So my (only) brother invited me to come and live with him for a little while out in California until I got back on my feet. He had a great job and and talked to his boss about hiring me once I got out there. Cool. A new place, a new job, hangin out with my bro. Sounds great. Well, my brother had a girlfriend at that time (who I never liked and fortunately he’s no longer with her)

I came out to Maggie by casually saying that I was bi, and my girlfriend at the time subsequently came out as a lesbian. Her parents raised her on stereotypical “conservative christian” values, which happened to include treating queer people as sinners.

2 stories… A Best friend: I had a best friend that I had been friends with for about 3 years+ who also happened to be gay. This particular friend (we’ll call him Dante) had been diagnosed with HIV the year prior. I always felt really bad about that and wanted to do nice things for him when and while he was feeling good. Most of the time on the meds he would get easily sick or tired 70% of the time. He also partied more than the average person so there was that too. I had received a large payment from a client and I decided it would be fun to celebrate my birthday (Feb) in Spain. I knew that I’d  

When was the first time you realised that your cat really loved you?
What should I do? My GF is saying that either we get married or she will dump me. We have a 7-year relationship but I'm still not ready to get married. I love her but she is leaving me unless we arrange a wedding in the next 3 months.
Every relationship gets to a point where you decide to get married or break up. Both of you need to break up. I was in your girlfriend’s shoes. Thankfully I wasted 2, not 7 years of my life with a guy. Those types are never serious nor ready for that level of commitment but too scared of being alone. Same thing; had the DTR with him. Later he surprised me with a beautiful proposal, but shortly after, the engagement was extremely stressful; nothing changed. One day he’s like yes let’s get married and next day oh I’m not sure. It was exhausting. Wedding planning helped me get away from that stress  

Been married several times and I’ve got to give you two ends of the spectrum. On one hand, marriage is for suckers. I mean you’ve been with her for 7 years. What have you not done that you can only do in a marriage? File joint taxes? Guarantee each other’s inheritance? Visit in the hospital? Get on the other’s insurance plan? All stupid reasons to get married. You mentioned something about different countries? Immigration is actually a good reason to get married. Other than that, a cynic would say it sounds like she’s got other plans for you or your fortunes. He’d say “If I was in your shoes, I’ 

My grandma had a saying for this. “Shit. Or get off the pot.” If you don’t know that you want to marry a woman after 7 years (!) of being in a relationship, then you need to figure out your mind and fast. I told my (now) husband after less than a year of dating that I was going to have to make a job decision in the next few months. I needed to have a firm decision from him on whether or not we were going to get married or not before I decided to stay where we were living at the time or move back to be closer to my family. I was not staying without a ring on my finger, or at least a firm propos 

Your gf said that to you? You mean your “girlfriend”? 7 years, and she's still your “gf”. Wow! Seven years she's been acting like your wife, you've been treating her like a wife. Sleeping in her bed each night, nursing you through sickness, washing your clothes, sucking your dick…. 7 fuckin' years you've been sucking the youth out of her and you don't respect that woman enough to ASK HER to honor you by becoming your wife.., and she wants to get married. She should have left you a long time ago. You are abusive and self-centered. If after 7 years you “are not ready”, then you really need to give her 

I had a fiancé just like you. He wasn’t ready after many years, almost 7. I one day got sick of his not being ready to just grow up and figure out what he wanted in life and I left him. Two years later (after being with HIM for 7) I was not only married, I was pregnant. No joke. So all these years later, I am happily married to someone else with a child. Coincidentally, my ex-fiancé lives 7 blocks from my new house. We stayed friends on FB, and I got a little concerned about the fact that we both live in the same small town. I looked up his address, wanting to be sure I wasn’t going to run int 

Wow this sounds familiar. I also had a 7-year relationship, in which she wanted to get married and I “wasn’t ready to.” I have to say, your girlfriend is being pretty kind, respectful, and vulnerable to express her needs to you. My girlfriend simply got frustrated, and ended the relationship. In fact, I think most women would just leave. What you have to understand is that your girlfriend loves you, but she also has important life goals which include marriage and probably family. These are very important to her. What you should ask yourself is “Why am I not ready?” For me, there were some important as 

This is a tough &amp; hard question to answer since so many variables can affect you &amp; your decision so I’m just going to try and do this on a basic and “Man to Man” kind of talk. As you’ve said, you have a 7 year long relationship and I will presume that you &amp; her are “In Love” , that you both do truly care for one another and enjoy time spent with each other and consider the past 7+ years a good investment of time. You then need to ask yourself “Why am I not ‘Ready’ for Marriage”? What is holding you back ? What are you afraid of ? What else do you feel you need to do before you feel like you wil 

I knew a guy once that was in a 5 year relationship but he just wasn’t ready to “settle down”. I talked with him a bunch of times about it because he was such a nice and kind guy and the girl was the love of his life and he would only ever get married and have children with her, he said. He couldn’t explain why not now. She was patient and seemed to be okay with the arrangement though. Fast forward 6 years. Whatever barrier makes the thought of being committed so impossible to him has not diminished. She is now in her late-ish 30s and he knows she wants kids. So he tells her she should forget h 

This is such a great question and I’m so glad you made the decision to ask it. NEVER let someone pressure you into marriage! PERIOD! Marriage is a TREMENDOUS commitment and an AWESOME responsibility! If you are not ready, you are NOT READY! NO ONE should pressure someone into marriage and, quite frankly, no one should WANT to pressure someone into marriage! People who want to get married, but are with a partner who feels they are not ready, can ALWAYS leave and go meet someone else, but NO ONE should ever pressure someone into getting married! Let me offer you some thoughts. Many women and men  

Generally, I think giving ultimatums are distasteful. However, context matters, and in the context of a 7 year relationship, I don't think its particularly unreasonable. What you need to do is to be honest with yourself. Question 1: Do you want to marry her? Possible answers: No. If this is your answer, I think its obvious that you have an irreconcilable difference. Your relationship is over, maybe it even lasted too long. You have to accept this and move on, and allow her move on.Maybe/I'm not sure. If this is your answer, we'll come back to that shortly.Yes, but not in 3 months. This also requir

When was the first time you realised that your cat really loved you?
Just after college, I responded to an ad from an overloaded animal shelter in NYC. They were looking for volunteers to house cats temporarily while they searched for permanent homes. I was given a mother with her eight week old kittens. I had no prior experience with cats much less kittens, but was elated to have them. They five would climb up my boyfriend’s jeans and sit on his shoulders. Sometimes one would make it all the way to his head. I had no idea they had so much personality! We were to look after them for a month while they were weaned. Gradually it occurred to us that one kitten woul 

My parents were violent people. My mom would use our bodies as an outlet for stress whenever my dad was not around. She would time these “punishments” when my dad would be away for days so he would not see the wounds, bruises, and bite marks. On an almost daily basis, she would get away with hitting and kicking us in areas of our bodies hidden by clothing. I had a cat then, and she was a real bitch. I attributed this mean behavior of hers to her past, as a stray cat who was used to being neglected and abused on the streets of a local wet market, where i picked her up. Seeing myself in her, I to 

My brother was studying in Copenhagen. In November 2018, his laptop exploded and burned everything in his room, except his expensive phone that he had bought with his own money and things in the cupboard. He was already depressed and it was going to be Christmas vacation at his uni so we decided to bring him home to India after his exams were done. In less than a month, someone at a train station stole his phone. He had NOTHING left with him. I booked his flight immediately and asked him to make EC as his passport was burnt too. He came home for a month and left. When he reached his house in C 

My first cat, Tiger, my sweet sweet boy, used to cuddle up to me when I was crying. I would be sobbing quite softly in my room, with my door closed, at the age of 13 or 14, and he would pidder padder from wherever he was and start meowing at my door. I used to find it so annoying because I’d prefer to be alone and he had a habit of coming into rooms after I had gotten up to let him in, and then trying to leave as soon as I sat down. But then, I realised, If I kept the door open a crack for him to paw open, he felt much more at ease. I guess confined spaces scared him. He would come right next to m 

My cat’s name is Marmalade, and she’s an Indie street breed whose mother was brought up as a house cat. She was brought to me on my birthday when she was bareky 2.5 months old because her new young mom was beginning to abandon her kittens. This was happened in March (I got her in october), the last yead had been rough for me cause I lost my grandma just 2 months prior getting her. She wasn’t very keen with humans and didn’t like to show much appreciation towards us (Now she’s about 1 year old and there’s something difference in her bahabiour now). It was in the evening and I recieved a call abou 

We got Bootsie from a local shelter. He is a beautiful male Snowshoe and was about 2 1/2 years old when we got him. He had been used for breeding, and was then sold to a family who had a very dominant male cat, and a husband who didn’t like this little Snowshoe. They kept him for about 3 months and then turned him over to the shelter. Bootsie spent 6–8 weeks at the shelter before we adopted him. When we adopted Bootsie he had been neutered and we were told he was up to date on all of his vaccinations. We weren’t told that he had no social skills. That being said, the first few months Bootsie was 

I didn’t usually have to wait long. I have rescued cats for years, so I’ll just mention 3. I went to a shelter to get a companion for my little dog, who was used to being surrounded by animals and people all day. I was moving out of my parents’ house and into my own apartment, and as a full time teacher, I would be gone for long periods of time. I didn’t want to get another dog, so I had decided on a cat. I went not planning to get a male (I had grown up with female cats), a black cat (I had light furniture), or a long haired cat (too much grooming involved for a first year special ed teacher t 

Sushi was his name. I'd known for a long time that he loved me. He came to me as a tortured kitten. Often scared of his own shadow, he bonded to me immediately. I just never realized how much he loved me, until I got sick.  ( I was pretty sick, like lucky to be alive sick. I even had weird visions of him in the hospital, but that's a story for another time.) When I got home he clung right back to me, and life became a new normal for us. He learned to be careful around me. (I sat on him once because I didn't see him, which was a scary weekend for sure), but he adapted, and so did I.  It 

Meet my kitten Brownie:  This is the story of how i discovered she really loves me. When I graduated from highschool, I was offered a great opportunity to study in one of my country's best universities, thank God. Problem is, the university is 2 hours away from home, so I needed to rent a dormitory. I did, and I share it with a classmate of mine. Even though I come back home every weekend to see my family , it is really difficult to leave every Sunday night and spend a week away. I am very attached to my cats, and the hardest thing to do is saying goodbye to them every Sunday. However, the first tim 

In 1983 the economy was booming in Anchorage faster than construction could keep up with it. There was a zero vacancy rate in town. People with good jobs were living in their cars because there were no places available. Naturally, our landlord jacked up our rent so my wife and I had to move out. All we could find was a cockroach infested apartment that became vacant because the previous inhabitant was arrested for contract murder. No pets were allowed. I assume the mice and cockroaches had grandfather rights. My wife decided we needed a cat. I’m a cat person, but as hard as it had been to get t 

How do married people stay in love with their spouse when they are old, wrinkled, and grey?
I’m not quite wrinkled yet but I’m definitely past mid-life so the grey hairs have well and truly taken over. My husband and I have now reached the point where we’ve been together longer than we’ve lived apart. We met in Santorini, Greece, a few decades ago, when neither of us were necessarily looking to fall in love. He was on his way to Gallipoli to visit his great grand-father’s grave, while I had just finished university in France and wanted to spend the rest of my summer in Greece. He was the first person I remember meeting on my second day on the island. I suppose everybody was new and i 

Hmmm… let me try to answer this. When I first met my wife I thought she was crazy beautiful. I was not, however, in love with her. I didn’t know her but saw her from afar. To me she was like beautiful art. Truly gorgeous. Then I got to know her. We became best friends first. No sexual relationship. Just friends. I then learned that she was truly beautiful inside also. This is why I began to fall in love with her. It was not because of her looks, it was because of the person she is. So now we have been married for 27 years. Perhaps she is not as physically beautiful as she was back then. She is, h 

If you marry your spouse of the same age give and take about five years different then you will grow old together. Men and women will have wrinkles , white hair, arthritic joints, and all signs of ageing. If you have loving kindness for each other then you will be together until death do us apart. You will have your children to comfort you in your old age. Many men in their fifties committed adultery normally with a woman young enough to be his daughter because of unrealistic expectations .

I can only speak for myself and not for old, married couples. I’m still young and unmarried, but here’s my input anyway. I do not plan to marry any woman for her physical appearance. I want a woman with a certain type of personality and mindset. Physical appearances change over time, but good personalities can remain the same or even improve as spouses grow older. I will always associate my future wife’s physical appearance with her positive qualities which I’ll greatly treasure for life. When she’s old, wrinkled and grey, we will have spent so much time together and experienced so many positiv 

When I met my now wife, she was a young 26year old with long blond hair, she was the most beautiful person I had ever seen and way out of my league. Anyway I started to chat to her online, it was wonderful even though I was 16 years her senior she made me feel at ease with all we talked about, I had just come out of a loveless relationship and honestly thought I would be alone for the rest of my life. As time passed I grew close to her Sam, and looked forward to getting home from work every day so I could log on and chat to her, I would tell her about my day and she would tell me about hers, I  

You begin by choosing your partner wisely. You don't settle. You must ask yourself: Is this person the love of your life? Is this person someone you find difficult to be apart from? Is this someone who compliments you and your lifestyle? I've heard people say about the companion they're with, “She's (or he's) a good person.” Yes, that's all well and good, but it's not enough. Do they light a fire of passion within you? Do you find it hard to keep your hands off them? Next month, my wife and I will celebrate 47 years of marriage, although we've been together a lot longer having met when we were 

Being in love isn't the same thing as being in lust. All people get old and grey if they are lucky, there is no avoiding that. There is also no human right that states that we all deserve to be with someone that stays hot for their entire life. Doesn't it sound silly to expect that when you think of it that way? Everyone would be single, that's not even feasible. When you love someone, you like their personality and being with them. That doesn't necessarily go away. If you were attracted to them in the beginning, that attraction is strengthened by love. An old grey husband still looks like his y 

If you need a perfect, in-context example of what love is, read James Meszaros’ previous response to this question. If you want to understand on a more conceptual level, I’ll try to explain here… To begin with, this question conflates love with lust. And this is problematic. As a former high school English teacher, I used to spend quite a bit of time working through the difference with my students. (Note: this conversation wasn’t off-topic, as Romeo and Juliet was part of the core curriculum.) This is what I used to tell them: Sonnet 116 by William Shakespeare (reprinted below for ease) is the mos 

In the event that you marry your better half of the identical age give and take about 5 years different then you'll definitely grow old together. Both women and men may have lines and wrinkles , white tresses, arthritic bones, and all signs of ageing. When you have loving-kindness per other then you will be together until demise do united states aside. You will have your young ones to comfort you within old age. A lot of men within their fifties committed adultery normally with a female younger adequate to be their girl as a result of unrealistic expectations . Be practical it is your dollars  

Old, wrinkled, and grey? Sheesh, sonny. I bet you're a real charmer with the ladies, eh? Come closer, I can't hear ya. Ok, well…because it's too darn annoying to get up and move and start all over when you're old, wrinkled, and grey. That's why! Your joints ache, your back gives out on an almost daily basis, and gods forbid you should trip over something. You'll fall and break your dang hip. That hurts! Have you ever fallen, and not been able to get up? It's not nearly as fun as it sounds, let me tell ya. For the ones that last, part of how it happens is that you've been together for years, you 

Did you ever fall in love in a war zone/deployment?
Yes.  With this young girl right here. I met her in a small village on the outskirts of Marjah, Afghanistan. I can honestly say that this little girl made me who I am today. So we were out on patrol, you know the usual…       You know, what humans normally do, burn stuff, try to get the radio to work, and do your damnedest to make it look cool. Well it was about a quarter of the way through the patrol. I was walking along, looking around. Hating myself. Hating the desert. Hating people. Hating the sun. Hating Afghanistan. And hating Afghans. I was at a point in my life then when I would have gladly let th

Any Muslim male can marry a Christian female even if her family didn't accept this. but they got married anyways. but a Christian male can't marry a Muslim female even if she loves him. He will just get his ass threw in the jail for lifetime and his family will destroyed and burned by the law and his nighbourhood Muslim people. Last year, I had relationship with a Muslim girl. I just loved her so much that I take a risk for her, even if I'm gonna die in t 

My stories are not nearly as noble or romantic as some of the other answers. I met a stripper in Texas. Absolutely stunning gal, dead ringer for porn star Savanna Samson. To take it up just a notch, when I met her, her mother was also stripping in the same club. I asked her out and she said yes. I spent the last 4 days we were in port there with her. I talked to her about her dreams. She wanted to be a Dental Hygienist. Well I told her that the Navy has a great program for Dental Techs. We parted ways but I came back a year later for another visit. Went to the strip club, I didn’t find her but  

A2A. Close and yes, in two very different ways. My “baby-san” in my unit area - a woman I paid a very small amount to wash my uniforms and mind my hootch - was a physically beautiful, soft-spoken young woman who rarely spoke, about age 22. I never put a hand on her, unlike what I later understood was a common approach. She could easily have made ten times more ‘P hooking. But she was honorable. I later found out that she had already been widowed twice, and had two children. One of the most haunting photos of the hundreds I took in country was of her, in 1968, wearing that cone hat, with those e 

Yes, i'm sure it happens very often. It did to me in 1966, when I was in the Navy, and our ship pulled into Hong Kong, itself a very alluring and seductive place to a seventeen year old. While having some suits custom made (the cost back then was $25.00 apiece) at a tailor shop, a cute little girl named Hoi Poi Poi, peeked from around a curtain and even though the proprietors (her legal guardians as she was an orphan) discouraged us, I was smitten! I saw her the next time our ship was back in Hong Kong. Then I volunteered to stay in Viet Nam the next time our ship anchored off the coast near Da 

We met during training. It was a month long, we flirted a little but there was no free time to get together. Once training wound down and we had just a few days left, we went to see a movie. After, we went up to my hotel room. Never thought we’d see each other again. Skip to a month into my deployment to Iraq. My team is requested to work with Special Forces 5th Group so our office moves closer to their part of the base. Since we are on their side, we are allowed to eat at their dining facility. During lunch one day, I spot him. He comes over and says hi. We chat a little and go our separate wa 

Why yes. Yes I have, and I’m still very much in love to this very day. Have you ever had a buttcrack full of sweat? Has the part of the world you were in at the time been so dirty, that even the air itself is dirty? Well, if you mix dirt, and buttcrack sweat together, you get mudbutt. Mudbutt becomes sandpaper between your cheeks. On a long patrol, that sandpaper does a fine job of destroying your skin, and your will to live. When you get back to your shack, with a raw bottom, life gets even better, when the only place you can go is a 130° porta-potty, swarming with POO flies that like to land

Yes, in Vietnam. I met a girl working for the Red Cross there. I was an infantry platoon leader. We fell in love and got married when we both came back to the states.

Not I. It does happen though. Generally it is only a problem if one partner is in the others chain of command, or if there is a substantial rank difference. The practice of generals diddling junior enlisted is frowned on, regardless of whether flowers are involved. The great warning to be given is that lovers often get married, and the military isn't great about stationing married pairs together. You'll only get that partner's comfort and attention on the deployment you meet on. After that you are likely to conduct your relationship via phones and letters. 6K views · View upvotes · Answer requested by Abdullah Zubair Khan17Sophia-Helene Mees de Tricht, If I had a nickel for every weird relationship I've had, I'd quit this job.Answered 3 years ago · Author has 5.8K answers and 27.9M answer views

What happened in that moment when you realized you are in love with your significant other?
Do parents automatically love their child?
How do I negotiate a healthy relationship with my partner despite the fact that I don't want to help him raise his daughter? My daughter is now twenty and I am finished with raising kids. I do love my partner very much and want to grow old with him.
I once dated the male version of you, except I didn’t realize it at first. He approached me, well aware that I had a four year old daughter. His own children were adults. I assumed he was ok with the fact I had a young child or why else had he approached me? But no, he informed me he was done raising children and ready to retire. That he loved me and wanted a future with me and wanted to marry me. When I pointed out he’d just made two diametrically opposed statements he assured me he hadn’t. That he wanted me but not the responsibility that my young daughter would bring. I informed him that if h 

You don’t. You can’t have a healthy relationship with the love of your life while excluding the people he loves the most in this world and expect him to be fine with it. My wife and I are both people of faith, born again Christians. There are many flavors of Christianity, and ours is of the belief that your spouse comes before your children. I know this may tick off some people, but do hear me out. When I met my now wife, she was a single mother of a beautiful 6 year old girl. Back then, we weren’t established in our faith, but we still gave each other the respect we wanted from the other. I knew 

I was that child. My “mother" decided that this dashing man in uniform was more important than her daughter. Yet, still, she would not allow me to go and live with my father. At first, he was just cold and uninterested. He ignored my attempts to interact with him and my mother told me to leave him alone. He then began to discipline me “for" my mother. His preferred methods were physically beating me; dragging and jerking me around by my hair; and mental and emotional degradation and humiliation. Keep in mind I was a young child. They married when I was 3 and this began during the first year of t 

Surprisingly, I've seen this work out but not in the way that you may think. One thing I have to ask how old is the daughter because that can change things. Also there is a difference between treating her as an unwelcome house guest/stranger versus literally being a second mother. If the daughter is a teenager or older, it's easier as they understand the concept of these boundaries to not expect you to be their actual mother. However if you think that you can ignore the daughter completely and pretend she doesn't exist, or think that you may never ever be in a position where you feel responsible 

Hey there! I have a relatively contradictory answer to some that you have received. Here’s the thing - people have a knee-jerk emotional reaction to step/blended family questions and often individuals hold very contradictory and impossible standards for step or potential step parents. On one hand, they want you to love the child like your own, but on the other hand you are to never discipline the child and step back from an actual parental role. What actual researchers say is much different, at least from what I have read. What Wednesday Martin explains in her book, Stepmonster, is that trying to 

When I was 21 years old I married a man ten years older than me, who had a 9 year old daughter. She was a spoiled only child and I honestly didn’t wish to be a mother. First few years we had her only two weeks each summer plus a long weekend during her Christmas holiday (we lived out of state). When I was 24 years old, my stepdaughter along with her mother (my husband’s ex) and the man her mom had married were in the crash on a small airplane he was piloting. Her mother and stepfather died in the crash but my stepdaughter, age 12, was found alive (it took 24 hours for the plane to be found as  

You aren't going to be able to have a healthy relationship with your partner, because single parents and their child/children are a package deal. Both my grandmother's were single parents at different points in their lives, and at a time period during our history that was considered taboo to date or marry someone with children from a prior marriage. My maternal grandma left an abusive husband when her son was just a few months old and filed for a divorce, when her son was about 4 years old she met and fell in love with my grandfather and it wasn't long after they got married that my grandma beca 

My mother died when I was ten. My brother was nine and my sister, who has cerebral palsy, was four. My father married a woman who had 17-year-old daughter a few years later. Her daughter was already married and had a baby. They dated off and on for a couple of years before they got married. It took a lot of persuading for her to marry him. He mostly stayed at her apartment when they were dating and left us kids on our own. I prayed for them to get married when they first started dating. I missed my mother so much and wanted my father’s girlfriend to be a mother figure to me. But by the time th 

I left a relationship with a man who was my everything. I told him I was a packaged deal as I had twin sons who, at the time were 2 years old. He lovingly accepted my sons along with me. My sons loved him and he was terrific in every way in raising them. However as our relationship grew, he wanted me to fly off to any part of the world for extended periods of time with him and leave my sons with their father. He is an anesthesiologist and did free work in areas in need. I also had started a new job as a RN at the time we met and had zero vacation accrued nor could I take off for extended time. I 

Well your choice is this, you either love and accept all of him, or you don't and move on. All of him includes the aspects about him you may not like. This also includes the people he chooses to have in his life including his daughter. You choosing this man also chooses his daughter. You can not have him and only him. You can not keep the bits you like and discarge the rest. Love doesn't work like that. He is a package deal. If there is some aspect you really don't want to deal with then the relationship is incompatible. Incompatible means it's not going to work between you two. This is especiall 

What little quirks do your pets have that make you love them?
 This is my pet chicken the first day I got her. She was so calm after only a minute in her new pen she fell asleep. She had three other chicks to have as companions but she wanted to spend time with humans instead. The other three slept together, but she would go off by herself and sleep in the corner nearest to my husband and I. Sometimes while the others were sleeping she would look up at us with sad little eyes till we picked her up, then she'd nestle into our hands and go right to sleep. We socialized all four of them equally in the beginning, but when it was obvious that the other three only  

I am the custodian of a Great Dane, and I have been his “pack alpha" since he was ten weeks old. Although he was fully, up-to-date vaccinated, he contracted canine parvovirus when he was seven months old -- about a five percent chance. At that time he had become quite the “big baby", weighing in at over one hundred pounds. If you know anything about canine parvo, you can imagine what a mess THAT made! We sequestered him in the kitchen and had food delivered. I administered intravenous liquids (Pedialyte and so on) and got him through the illness, although it took over two weeks. When it was ove 

Great question here! I am in awe of Chanler's Dylan. All my pets had quirks. I had a series of miniature rabbits who had the run of my college apartment. One hated men and if one of them appeared, she would make a beeline for his ankles and bite him THROUGH his socks! She would also bite anyone on the bottom who sat in her seat on the couch. Another had to be returned because he ate plaster off the walls. All of them paced in the hallway if the door to the bathroom was closed where their litterbox was kept. I had a cat who ‘shook out’ her paws while walking. I had a Singapura cat who was the pre 

Sometimes I think our dog is more of a person than a dog. She’s a golden doodle who’s not yet 2. Since we got her at 7.5 weeks, it seems she lost a lot of doggie traits and gained human ones. She actually likes to be held in your lap even though at 35 lbs., she’s too big to be a lap dog. We hold her like we would hold a sitting toddler and she insists that you put your arm in front so her hind paws have a “resting bar.” That’s where she props up her legs and her left paw will always rest on the “armrest.” (my forearm).  She doesn’t even come for breakfast/dinner when called. And when she gets to  

Mooch is a butter. If he wants affection, he'll let you know by butting the crap out of you. He's a big cat and it can be quite painful, but I like it. He's also the explorer of my cats and will go on hunger strike if we try to keep him in. He doesn't like food much anyway and only eats to survive. He won't eat wet food at all and won't touch any crunchies that have different coloured biscuits - they have to be all brown or he'll starve himself. He's my first and biggest baby.  Mooch. My Cheeky-Chops was my talker. He would demand attention by standing in front of me and screaming. I would answer 

This’ll be a bit long winded but I will eventually get to the point. Besides, if I make it short and to the point Quora will collapse it. I’ve been trying to live trap a very intelligent escape artist feral cat. Instead I caught,  A possum  Our cat Mia, Twice.  My dog Dolly, Twice like Mia.  And a racoon that I’d have loved to keep.  Our Tuxedo cat Teo had better sense than to enter the trap as did her momma Fiona, and sister Lilly.  My dachshund is an intelligent dog. I was a bit disappointed with her that she was so easily fooled. I told my wife that the canned cat food I’d used as bait must have cancell 

My dog, Stanley, is lovable by all. He likes new people, and jumps on them all the time, (his way of saying hi, which we haven’t been able to train out) He has a curly tail, mostly confused eyes, back legs that are way longer than his forelegs, and a hilarious underbite. Here’s a picture:  Quirks? Don’t get me started. He’s scared of his food bowl and he will get a mouth-full of food, then run over to his bed and eat them there. Then he will come back over, grab more, and repeat. He will finish by kicking his hind legs and growling as if he has defeated a great enemy. He hates the neighbor’s dogs 

So i currently have 3 pets. Each is his own animality.   So heres the youngest. About 9 months old. He's still a stupid baby with genius running under the fool. He plays in the sand box with my kids which wins me over watching him gleefully bury each laughing child then nudges them out to refill the hole only to start all over again. But the thing I love most, above his smarts and goofy childs play, his super floofiness and genial attitude above all the excitement and love he showers us with, is his love of mouthing off. I tell this little toothy monster no and if he disagrees we end up having a ha 

ahhh… where to begin? I’ve always grown up around cats, and I can honestly say I have never met one quite like my Milo. he is scared of EVERYTHING! The hoover, strangers, noises, the pet bunny, inanimate objects. Seriously, I saw him jump out of his skin the other day because my wife had left her shoes on the stairs and he wasn’t sure what to make of them!Despite being toilet trained since he got him, he sometimes, just to spite me I’m sure of it, decides to wee on the carpet. Usually when I am otherwise engaged, like using the toilet myself, so I can’t grab him and shove him in his litter box.W

Jack is the most … unusual dog I had all my life, and I have had some of them. “Dog” is not the proper description for him. He doesn’t have anything to do with other dogs. He is interested in humans. And following us around, whether there are other dogs in the house or not. He clearly does not identify himself as one of them, but rather as one of us. He’s not hostile or shy with dogs: just not interested. He tried to mimic me and sit on my chair and type on my keyboard and move my mouse. I needed to change the peripherals few times. It didn’t go well. He was as gentle as possible, but he’s stil 

Do cats actually love their owners?
For a long, long time, it has been said of domestic cats that they are very greedy animals, and only look for their humans when they need food. They are directly opposed to dogs, which are treated as animals faithful by nature, and capable of giving absolutely everything for their owner. While there is talk of dogs that have waited for years for their owners, in the case of cats we talk about cats that ate their owners once they died. The stories can not be more opposite. But is this really the case? Are cats so opportunistic? Or are these nothing more than clichés? Those of you who have a cat will 

Yes, they do, but it is not as straightforward as it is with say, a dog. Their love, and here i am writing based on my own experience, is conditional, meaning the more you put into the relationship, the more they give back. By their definition, they are not a pack animal, so there is no hierarchy like it is with dogs. Therefore, the relationship can become rather complex. When people try to “own” them, i.e. try to subject them to some form of hierarchy (because we are also a pack-forming animal) or when people don’t make an effort to understand them and their needs, things start to go bad and  

Former dog person here. I’ve switched to the dark side. Here’s the thing. The cat-owner relationship depends on several different factors. Some cats definitely love their owners. Others see their owners as a simple food source. From my experience, here are the main factors at play: Is he an indoor or an outdoor cat? Different people see and raise their cats differently. In turn, the relationship they have with their cat reflects these differences.Outdoor cats are given the freedom to hunt on their own, and therefore, they develop a level of “hardness” to their personality. Their relationships, ev

I am allergic to cats, so I tried for years to not be a cat person. But cats are drawn to me for some reason. My guess is that they don't feel pushed to socialize because I don't make the first move. One day, not so long ago, I was quarantining with family and one of them brought a tiny sick kitten in. “They know how to deal with this.” I tell myself “Be strong, stay away.” But the next afternoon while I was working on homework I heard the most wretched rasping. It resounded throughout the whole house. “Raaa! Raa!” I looked high and low for a responsible adult to care for this tiny being that was 

Cats are difficult to read, mainly because they’re not like humans or dogs, they work backwards from how we work. To put it another way and make a comparison, actions speak louder than words. This is the belief that what you do overrides what you say, and in my own way I find it a fitting description for cats and dogs. Cats typically show love through small actions. Little, tiny things that most people wouldn’t notice if they never had a cat. I’ve owned both a cat that saw me as barely more than a provider and a cat that sees me as a legitimate mother. The first cat grew old and died (just cle 

Owh, they really do love their owner. Only dog people will never understand. Cat-owner relationship is different as you can think about dogs with their owner. Once you developed their trust, you are like parents to them. Yes, having a cat is definitely like having children. Cats only understand you, your family and the house they live. Their loving and affectionate are mostly what they already trust on. Even some cats, if you move to another house, they need some time to be comfortable with their new environment. Dogs are different. Dogs can be friendly with anybody (not all dogs though, once I 

Absolutely. I will use myself as an example. I used to not care so much for cats. I did not despise them but I was indifferent towards them until I had my own first cat. His name was Chengze. It means orange in Mandarin.  Chengze and I bonded quickly. He was my orange hyper furball. One of the things he used to love doing was every morning trying to jump from my tv to where I was laying on the bed. He succeeded most times in waking me up. Then he would lay on my chest or back and pur his heart out. If he was on my chest then he would try and bite my goateche. Also, he preferred this way of me hol 

I didn't realize how much my cat really loves me until my mom came to visit for a few days and witnessed what Buddy does when I leave my home. Normally when I arrive home Buddy greets me at the door. He starts meowing on the other side even before I have my key in the lock, and as soon as the door cracks open his little face is peeking through, big green eyes looking up at me expectantly. Then he jumps around, meows excitedly and rubs up against me the way cats do to transfer their scent: “My human! Mine!” I figured he does what lots of pets do — he hears me coming and stops whatever he’s doing t 

I would say they do, as long as you’re the one they bond too. I’ve had tons of cats in my lifetime, Most of them would bond to other parts of my family, or be the kind of cat who only wants attention when they want food. I’ve fortunately struck incredible luck with my current baby Macchiato. This answer is pretty fitting because one year ago, I decided to adopt my first cat as a adult. (Any other time it was always my parents making the desicion of what pet we have) I was however finally making money and the first thing on my “ starting my life “ to do list was to have a lifelong fur baby of my 

I read an extremely interesting article recently, an article that showed how the bond between humans and cats are stronger than the bond between humans and dogs, and here’s why. Dogs have been in the process of human domestication for the last 18,800–31,100 years according to primarily European fossil records. We have bred dogs to look the way we want, act the way we want, and respond the way we want. If you’ve ever owned a dog, you may have noticed that their facial features will often mimic yours when you are angry, sad, or happy. Have you ever seen the funny FB picture of the guilty dog? Yea 

Is it okay to love my two sons (ages 13 and 16) more than I love the 14-year-old daughter? My sons are much easier to raise. My daughter has drama that my sons don’t come with. Additionally, she’s ran away from home and self-harms.
It is absolutely ok to love your sons more than your daughter. In your case your daughter appears to be less loveable and this is because of her behaviour. Were she more cooperative you would like her more. It is that simple. It is not your fault that you feel the way you do. My mother preferred my brother to me. She made it very clear. As she put it, they thought the same way about things so there was much accord between them. They used to criticise and denigrate other people or even laugh in circumstances that I adjudged to be unfair or downright cruel. I am more of a softie and they were har 

I don't know if your male or female. If your a male I can understand that you relate more to your boys. Teenage girls have more drama then the boys. Remember high school when the guys got high 5's for hitting 2nd base and the girls were called sluts? Maybe that was just my school, but I doubt it. When I was 14 I was overweight. I was made fun of. I had my group of friends and the drama got annoying, but they were my friends. Did my parents know I was made fun of? No. Did they know about the drama? No. I didn't talk to them about that stuff. Add in that around that age hormones are all wacky and 

As a mother who has a teenage daughter that has been quite difficult and 3 sons who yes are much easier at times does not mean that I love them any more then I love my daughter. Let me explain why. When I had my oldest and after his diagnosis I never thought I would carry another child because his father and I carried a 1:4 chance of having another child with Cystic Fibrosis. Our dreams seemed to be shattered since we wanted a big family. Our dreams were to have all boys to make up a baseball team which I prayed heavenly on and dear lord knows when I hit 16 years old I was not the easiest child 

Parents are told its not right to have a favorite among their kids, and it may be, but most parents if honest have one they enjoy spending time with more than the others. It isnt that one kid is a better human than the others ir that you would allow the others to be treated differently (that's bull shit to it happens) it's just that your kids are like every other humam in the world, they have traits you like and traits you despise and it's only natural you become closer to people who are more like you. I love my two sons with all my heart, but my daughter is the one I worry about when she is as 

Say what now??!!?? I can only imagine (although it makes me physically ill to do so) that not only is your daughter blatantly AWARE every waking and sleeping moment that you feel this way, but to add fuel to the fire, I'm sure your boys are aware too. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you are probably the reason she self-harms/runs away. And as for the drama….. HELLO ✊✊…. Do you remember being a teenage girl?? Drama comes with it at some level, especially during puberty. She not only needs the regular amount of love that ‘parents’ (used that word loosely here referring to you) 

I'd say that she already knows you love her brothers more than her. She runs away from home and self harms for a reason. Could be you treat her very differently to her siblings, even very slightly and, knowing you are unloved or, less loved, messes up a child's mind. Yes, they become rebellious and they act out. I say this as the daughter who was less loved. I have 2 younger brothers. I'm not saying it was purposeful but, they were certainly more loved and treated better than I was. As a result, after many years of it, I started rebelling at 16. I stayed out late and I was drinking, mostly to b 

Common-sense!!!!! She is the middle child which can be difficult in itself…trusted elder child with whom you have a longer history and connection, youngest (the baby), who quite often is a bit spoilt..then the middle child who can become invisible, and she's a girl, who you obviously weren't counting on…let me tell you, the man decides the sex of a child, not the mother. This young woman, is not deaf, blind and stupid, and can soon tell that's she's 3rd best in the pecking order.. but, if loved and encouraged, would become an absolute advocate for daddy, daughters usually love their daddy's. Y 

She sounds like she's in a crisis phase and i get what that's like. She probably explosive and volatile and angry. She's probably miserable and hayes herself and everything and, instead of coming to you or wanting cuddles and kisses to make it better- she's behaving in ways that push you away. She's making herself hard to love or want to be around. She's creating the external reality to reflect her internal reality. My daughter's always been the challenging one, and as we are both female/women it is different than it is with my son. Girls are complicated. They can often be harder- buy hey, it's 

NO. and to even say this isnt very good. you should LOVE your kids equally , that being said you dont have to LIKE your daughter as much as the low effort boys, but you should Love them all equally. i love both my monsters the same but totally disagree with the older kids choices and attitude and alot of the time dont like him very much, but i still love him just as much as the younger less mouthy child.and they are both adults now but the feelings are the same. whether your child or anyone else, some people we just dont see eye to eye with and generally dont like, but that shouldnt affect the l 

No. Your daughter self-harms. That's what sticks out most to me here, very concerning. And you love her less for it? What the hell is wrong with you? Get her some help, that is if she trusts you enough to do so. It may be too late. I was an only child and my mom didn't love me. I ran away. I self-harmed. I wanted to die. Every day I wondered why I wasn't good enough. I can't imagine how it would have felt to have people around who my mom did love, and for her to still not love me. I'd probably kill myself. Your daughter might be considering it. When my parents realized what was going on, my da 

What happened in that moment when you realized you are in love with your significant other?
I was friends with my boyfriend for a year before we got together. We talked every day. We went out together. We laughed together. I loved him - as a friend. Four days after we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend, exactly one month ago, I had a date night planned with him, but his roommate got sick, and we had to cancel. I was in the middle of moving into my flat, and had no furniture, food, or stuff to do. He stopped by at lunch time with pizza, flowers, strawberries, and ice cream. We ate, using a moving box as a table. We cuddled on a blanket on the floor. He told me I was beautiful, cal 

When I realized that I was in too deep. We started dating during my senior year and his first year of college after knowing each for three years. I had been single for a long time with the intention that I was not going to continue dating just to prove that I was worthy of having a boyfriend. Sure, dating happened, but the other parties knew that they would not become my significant other. He wanted a relationship with me and was forward about it, clearly stating his intentions. That got my respect and I told him that we could explore our options and if a foundation existed for trust and respect 

I had just gotten back from being away from home for about 10 months. My ex, who I lived with during that time in New Orleans, Louisiana I had caught cheating and needless to say I was in pretty rough shape. I was very confused, very hurt, and so very tired from being up for 48 hours. Thankfully the drive back home gave me much needed time to think and process what had happened but the one thing that I kept coming back to was being excited to be going back home. Despite being in that state my thoughts always strayed back to my best friend and I couldn’t contain the feeling of being absolutely e 

If you were to die tomorrow, I would treasure these two amazing dates we’ve shared. And, if you were to die in a month, I would have had a month to get to know you. And, if you were to die in six months, I would have had the chance to fall in love with you. Anything after that is icing on the cake. Those were the words she used to tell me that she was comfortable dating a man with late-stage cancer. Here we are. This photo sits in a frame at the top of the stairs to our second-floor living room, in our home.  In May of last year, I was in dating mode. I had a profile on a few dating apps, and I ha 

I've known my boyfriend since I was twelve years old. We were friends for a year or two, then we started to be friends who held hands, and then friends who kissed, and as we got older our relationship just kept changing. We still talked about history, watched Hank Green videos together, and fought over the proper way to solve social justice issues, but we physically started to be closer. We never dated, but we knew we were friends who also had feelings for each other that weren't platonic. We blamed it on teenage hormones for a long time. Sometimes we would stop doing our friends with benefits 

I had known my husband for 6 years before he finally asked me out. There was an opportunity where we were both single and finally set our sights on each other. I had gotten my wisdom teeth surgically removed the morning after our first date. I developed serious dry socket infections in all four gaping wounds in my mouth where the teeth were dug out. It was the most painful and horrible experience of my life up to this point. Childbirth didn’t even come close. My mom was looking after me in the days following my surgery. I couldn’t function from the pain, couldn’t get out of bed, and I kept throw 

The first time I saw her…well, our eyes didn’t meet, I was straining to catch some more subtle elements. Her thick wavy hair won’t permit, they sheathed most of her face. Some days later, our eyes met. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I was transfixed for a little longer than normal. She claims to have no memory of it though. The day I heard that coy girl speak for the first time, I loved it. That was the day I took up that botched up mission of asking for her notes, ended up asking her equally pretty friend. I quickly transformed from an insignificant-nobody to a buffoon, that wasn’t funny at al 

Ours was a complete arrange marriage. During our 10 months of courtship (a long distance one) though we got along well but I was not entirely happy with the course of our relationship. It was not anything even an inch similar to what it is shown in movies or I have seen happening with my cousins and friends, where the two people either since day 1 or sometimes later are in head over heels love with each other. I even confronted him regarding my insecurity to which his reply always remained the same, he constantly made me understand that we are living apart and contacting over texts/phones so th 

When i realized i actually wanted to do things with him, when i was willing to put in effort. Before my current boyfriend and i began seeing each other in December’s 2018, I was having a rough year. Had just graduated high school, had spent 10 months of that year in an unhappy relationship where i was abused, undermined, and ignored. I finally told my ex to hit the road when our 3 year anniversary had rolled around and I was drunk 3 hours away from his university. It was a difficult breakup. He stalked me for months after. Sending me pictures of his self mutilation, walking all over his city at  

I missed her. We were friends for years, having met in church. I always got the feeling that she liked me, but she drove me crazy. We kind of drove each other crazy, actually. We were asked to lead church events together, because we were good at it, but that often led to fights because she had trouble seeing how often I had the correct perspective on things… :-) She was about as different from me as anyone could be, so if there were two ways to do something, guaranteed we each chose a different way. We had lots of fun dates over the years with our other friends, just casual stuff. Game nights, di 

Why is my therapist acting more interested in me through email? Usually, she replies by just saying thank you, but this time she said, “have a lovely evening, I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.”
How will you describe your crush?
okaaaaaay at this point its not even a crush anymore, its MORE than that. imma give you a little background first. like, how i started noticing him and all. If u wanna skip all that, then just skip all the way up to the horizontal line further down. So this was last year, and i was walking down the hallway with my friends. we were talking about God knows what, and then i see him. He had crutches! I swear thats why i noticed him. Then i point to him and say to my friends, “i wonder how he got that.” and they were just like, “i dunno.” and then they went on with the conversation. but i was still looki 

ummm… so from where to start? first of all, he is one year older than me (i’ve just turned 15 and he is 16 now) and his birthday is two days after mine, so he is saggitarius as me and his mbti personality is intj. he goes to special informatics class for smarter kids and he is reallly into programming and goes to some competitions for that stuff (so yup he is really smart but i am also one of the better students too ;)). we met on guitar classes and i liked him from the first class but i saw he is a little bit depressive so i didn't know how to start talking with him. we started talking a lot in 

I don’t think my crush has Quora so thank God for that. But if HE ever sees this, I think he’ll know that I’m talking about him. (If you do see this, I’m sorry for still liking you even though you have a girlfriend. And sometimes I hate myself for liking you.) My crush is the kindest person that I’ve ever met. He has pretty short hair but I find it cute and it matches his personality. When he’s sad his eyes tend to look more brown and when he’s happy they look more green. He has light brown hair. His nose is a little crooked but it’s adorable. One of his upper teeth on both sides in his mouth i 

I have 2 crush actually, i kinda stare at them from afar bc they’re older than me TT (I’m asian living in an asian country so &lt;3) the first guy I had a crush on: natural black hair - sometimes dye it cat like eyes - one of his eyes is a double eyelid and the other is a mono lid (I actually have the same thing as him! Except my eye shape isn’t rlly the same) cute button nose gummy smile!! he’s very fair he’s always pouting (≧w≦) he recently got an undercut uwu he’s quite good at math he’s adorable, he acts like he doesn’t care about his friends but everyone know he does ( ´ ▽ ` ) (hes quite popular here) I 

I’m only admitting any of this because A. I don’t think it’s a crush, I’m denying it. &amp; B. It would be nice to tell someone, even strangers on the internet, and it’s anonymous. Now- I guess this is more of a story time then describing her. It’s my best friend. And it’s horrible. I’ve known her for 8 years, since 1st grade. I plan on being her best friend for forever. Even once we’re dead and gone, even if she doesn’t want me, no matter what, I want to be her best friend. We planned doing everything together. Sharing a future together. Collage, apartment, double weddings, watching each others kids, et 

Okay let's start!! ✨❤️ -He has dark hair. -He is 13 years old. -He likes athletic and confident girls. (which is not me) -His hair is a little bit long. -His smile is so so so so cute. -He has a diary. -He’s respectful to girls and elders as well. -He's really friendly but I cannot talk to him properly because his friends are popular, judgy and 💩. -He understands and forgives right away. (depends tho) -He has tan skin. -I know I will be called as a stalker but according to his instagram bio, his height is 5′6 ft (my height is 5′1 normal ryt?) -His texts are dry. -His face expressions are always joyful and 

He’s basically my dream guy. As much as I hate to admit it, he’s actually hilarious. Even his horrible accents could always make me smile.I can’t get over how sweet and genuine he is. I’ve seen the way he acts around his little sister, who obviously adores him. And how he’s so kind to everyone, even though he doesn’t have to be.Damn, his smile…Even though I’m sure he’s been through crap, he has the greatest outlook on life.Not gonna lie, he’s really cute. He has these light brown eyes that I literally could not stop thinking about.Even after 9 months, I am still not over him, even though I know

The first time I read your answer was close to a year and a half ago. You wrote about people staring at you. I opened the answer, read it, couldn’t really appreciate it, and moved to the next answer. There was no spark. No connection. Or so I thought, and boy was I wrong! The next answer of yours which popped up a few months later changed everything. You had written about how you made customised messages for your co-workers as a parting gift. Maybe a lot of people read the answer and were like whatever, but it struck a chord so deep in me that words fail to describe the emotion. Every single so 

What made your heart break today?
I'm heart broken about my life. The circumstances that has made my life the way it is. How I grew up. No excuse for things I've done. But man I am sure of my feelings this time. But I think it's too late. No matter what effort we do or try it just seems like some things a person won't let go of. People sometimes dont believe a person can change. The accusations are just more constant. I feel like I'm always going to be punished for the things I've done in my past. I am not perfect or ever claimed to be. I'm liked Lot. But percieved as something else in everyone's eyes. You never really know th 

What is something that broke my heart today?My so-called best friends.. So, it all starts when I was in grade 7. not a grade I was very fond of. In fact, I hated it. I had no friends I knew. The class teacher was horrible, and most terrible thing was that I was paired up with someone to such an extent that I nearly broke down. That incident broke our friendship and we don’t talk till this date. We practically ignore each other. When our friends meet we don’t go with them.  So what happens is I make a handful of friends who I don’t know completely. They are the most brilliant students of the clas 

Not today but 4 days ago….Yes this made my heart break…👇👇      Preview: There’s app called “BRAINLY”… so called educational app..this app has become really the worst app I’ve ever seen   The Guckinf creeps are just using the Google meet for all the bad purposes and misusing the girls who join … Day by day this is increasing a lot that even middle aged women are joining those meet..

I created a fake account with name and pic of my girl classmate with her consent and j 

I’ve been having pretty bad depression today. I just woke up in a terrible mood. It doesn’t help that I just moved and have no idea where my toothbrush is (bad hygeine just makes my depression 100x worse.) But I woke up, and had this realization I’ve been really, really stupid. And this is going to sound childish but hear me out here. I’m a 30 year old woman and have been crushing on this man for over a year now. He knows I like him, and we will talk on the phone sometimes (i have lived to far to be able to hang out.) And literally, I was crazy about him. He checked all the right boxes. Total opp 

Today, My daughter, Amelia Grace was born at 1136. The delivery was mercifully quick. The midwives, the nurses, the doctors and support staff were amazing and wonderful. My thanks are owed to the whole team at Reading's Royal Berkshire Hospital. Today, I descended into the deepest, darkest depths of grief. Deeper, darker, and more visceral than I ever dreamed imaginable. My daughter was born without the signs of life to which we so needed to see and hear. Her eyes were closed, her open mouth soundless, her lungs and heart not operating. Amelia was dead. The skin was separating from the subdermal l 

Well.. I broke down crying… You’ll see it… (End of video) &nbsp;0:00-0:30 I am heartbroken that he doesn’t even understand.. That.. He says he’s sorry but then later does things that make it contradictory.. Says things like this  Denies the abuse I experienced and gaslights me.. I’m heartbroken that I’m broken.. And well… People don’t cut me slack.. And that breaks me all the more. I’m trying hard to stay alive everyday I haven’t even yet slept because my PTSD has kept me up  I know I look bad.

If anyone has any advice about this, please help me out. I’m going crazy. It’s very difficult to find the words. But here goes. I’ve found a man who I think might be my soulmate. But I’ve chosen to cut him off completely rather than try dating him. Why the hell would I do that? Especially as this man is a healthy, kind and happy person with no mental health or addiction problems, who could make me very happy if I let him? It’s our age differences. I’m 27 and he’s 51. We met through a weekly book group I’ve attended for a few years. When this guy rolled up a few months ago, I was immediately intrig 

    This did. My childhood sweetheart. After loving him for 12 years and when our marriage is scheduled 4 months from today, I discover this. And, he looks straight into the eye and he says he did this as one of his seniors wanted him to talk to an escort for him. His version of story kept changing for like 30 times within half an hour. The moment I read this, I felt my heart pounding and blood rushing into my cheeks. I was sitting next to him in car, as we went to celebrate my birthday. I gained control in a couple of minutes. He wanted to explain and I wanted no explanation as it really does not both 

I am not heartbroken but I am flummoxed. Not as flummoxed as I was about 5 months ago. I think about it and if only I had an answer as to why he chopped my head off, metaphorically, it would have helped. But no matter what I asked, there was no answer. Yes, it was only about 3 months and via email but it was very, very nice, I do believe we both got something out of it. I asked a question that sent him over the edge. He cut me off abruptly and out of his life. And here I thought we had a very nice friendship; simply etalking, sharing, he helping me with some things I needed help with. I’ve rea 

Yeah today morning, I got up at night. Jokes apart I was unable to sleep last night as I had got tired of taking rest in the lockdown. So I decided to take some rest again to get rid of the tiredness, so that again I can relax after getting relaxed. Finally I woke up around 5.30 am in the morning. I was excited to see my childhood favorite serial Shaktimaan. I completed my daily routine stuffs in next 1 and a half hour, and still it was 2 more hours for Ramayana to start. Suddenly I heard a peculiar noise and believe me I rushed to my balcony. And I was very excited to see that entering in our  

What happened in that moment when you realized you are in love with your significant other?
I was friends with my boyfriend for a year before we got together. We talked every day. We went out together. We laughed together. I loved him - as a friend. Four days after we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend, exactly one month ago, I had a date night planned with him, but his roommate got sick, and we had to cancel. I was in the middle of moving into my flat, and had no furniture, food, or stuff to do. He stopped by at lunch time with pizza, flowers, strawberries, and ice cream. We ate, using a moving box as a table. We cuddled on a blanket on the floor. He told me I was beautiful, cal 

When I realized that I was in too deep. We started dating during my senior year and his first year of college after knowing each for three years. I had been single for a long time with the intention that I was not going to continue dating just to prove that I was worthy of having a boyfriend. Sure, dating happened, but the other parties knew that they would not become my significant other. He wanted a relationship with me and was forward about it, clearly stating his intentions. That got my respect and I told him that we could explore our options and if a foundation existed for trust and respect 

I had just gotten back from being away from home for about 10 months. My ex, who I lived with during that time in New Orleans, Louisiana I had caught cheating and needless to say I was in pretty rough shape. I was very confused, very hurt, and so very tired from being up for 48 hours. Thankfully the drive back home gave me much needed time to think and process what had happened but the one thing that I kept coming back to was being excited to be going back home. Despite being in that state my thoughts always strayed back to my best friend and I couldn’t contain the feeling of being absolutely e 

If you were to die tomorrow, I would treasure these two amazing dates we’ve shared. And, if you were to die in a month, I would have had a month to get to know you. And, if you were to die in six months, I would have had the chance to fall in love with you. Anything after that is icing on the cake. Those were the words she used to tell me that she was comfortable dating a man with late-stage cancer. Here we are. This photo sits in a frame at the top of the stairs to our second-floor living room, in our home.  In May of last year, I was in dating mode. I had a profile on a few dating apps, and I ha 

I've known my boyfriend since I was twelve years old. We were friends for a year or two, then we started to be friends who held hands, and then friends who kissed, and as we got older our relationship just kept changing. We still talked about history, watched Hank Green videos together, and fought over the proper way to solve social justice issues, but we physically started to be closer. We never dated, but we knew we were friends who also had feelings for each other that weren't platonic. We blamed it on teenage hormones for a long time. Sometimes we would stop doing our friends with benefits 

I had known my husband for 6 years before he finally asked me out. There was an opportunity where we were both single and finally set our sights on each other. I had gotten my wisdom teeth surgically removed the morning after our first date. I developed serious dry socket infections in all four gaping wounds in my mouth where the teeth were dug out. It was the most painful and horrible experience of my life up to this point. Childbirth didn’t even come close. My mom was looking after me in the days following my surgery. I couldn’t function from the pain, couldn’t get out of bed, and I kept throw 

The first time I saw her…well, our eyes didn’t meet, I was straining to catch some more subtle elements. Her thick wavy hair won’t permit, they sheathed most of her face. Some days later, our eyes met. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I was transfixed for a little longer than normal. She claims to have no memory of it though. The day I heard that coy girl speak for the first time, I loved it. That was the day I took up that botched up mission of asking for her notes, ended up asking her equally pretty friend. I quickly transformed from an insignificant-nobody to a buffoon, that wasn’t funny at al 

Ours was a complete arrange marriage. During our 10 months of courtship (a long distance one) though we got along well but I was not entirely happy with the course of our relationship. It was not anything even an inch similar to what it is shown in movies or I have seen happening with my cousins and friends, where the two people either since day 1 or sometimes later are in head over heels love with each other. I even confronted him regarding my insecurity to which his reply always remained the same, he constantly made me understand that we are living apart and contacting over texts/phones so th 

When i realized i actually wanted to do things with him, when i was willing to put in effort. Before my current boyfriend and i began seeing each other in December’s 2018, I was having a rough year. Had just graduated high school, had spent 10 months of that year in an unhappy relationship where i was abused, undermined, and ignored. I finally told my ex to hit the road when our 3 year anniversary had rolled around and I was drunk 3 hours away from his university. It was a difficult breakup. He stalked me for months after. Sending me pictures of his self mutilation, walking all over his city at  

I missed her. We were friends for years, having met in church. I always got the feeling that she liked me, but she drove me crazy. We kind of drove each other crazy, actually. We were asked to lead church events together, because we were good at it, but that often led to fights because she had trouble seeing how often I had the correct perspective on things… :-) She was about as different from me as anyone could be, so if there were two ways to do something, guaranteed we each chose a different way. We had lots of fun dates over the years with our other friends, just casual stuff. Game nights, di 

How can I tell if my girlfriend really loves me?
Girls can be quite expressive and obvious. When a woman loves you, she will dive into your world and make you her world. She will try to know everything about your world, mix up in your world. Your family will interest her more than her own family.She will take efforts for you, she will do lots of stuff for you. She will make you feel special. She will try to know what bothers you and cover up for it. She will try and understand you more, your preferences and tastes, and surprise you more often than that.She would care for you and advise you like you are her baby. Well, it's inherently there in

Actions and emotions are always in tune. If a girl truly loves you, her actions will be in tune with it. Never judge a girl by her words, the truth always lies in her actions. Most guys find girls confusing because girls usually don’t follow up on what they seem to be saying. The thumb rule to follow with girls is to base your judgments on their actions, rather than their words. Just because a girl tells you that she loves you, does not mean that she really feels love for you deep down. Girls are usually not very decided about what they want so they just follow their intuition unconsciously. That 

You don't.  Even though texting is now a huge part of how we convey information with each other, it misses out on a very crucial part of human communication: body language or nonverbal communication.   When we talk to one another in person, the majority of the way we communicate does not involve words!  With an emotion like love, how your girlfriend interacts with you in a physical space is a much more important indicator of how she feels about you than what she says in text messages.  She might say, "I love you SOOO much! &lt;3 &lt;3" in a text message, but when you're together, for example, she mai 

I think the question here is why are you questioning that she does? Is is because you’re hearing warning bells about her behaviour or is it because you really can’t see why she loves you? If its the first, one of the hardest lessons I learned and one of the wisest is, if you hear warning bells, listen to them, as long as they are genuine warning bells and not bells of your own making. Humans have a remarkable ability to self sabotage, due to our own lack of belief in ourselves and sometimes we can start reading signs and portents into things because we’re so afraid of losing someone and we end u 

Thanks for such a lovely A2A. Well, I think here are some of the points. If she is walking with you, suddenly she holds your hand tightly after seeing a gang of boys. Yes, she loves you.If she acts with complete maturity in front of others but behaves like a two year old, in front of you, yes she loves you.If your, just a Hi message sets a big smile on her face, and she puts her hair flick beside her ear. Yes, she loves you.If she really cares more for you and your family, aww, she loves you.If she says that she wants a junior you in the future, yes she loves you.If she is jealous and angry when

There various ways to know if your girlfriend loves you or not... 1. If your girlfriend loves you, she will be anxious to please you.2. If she loves you, she will be eager to see you all the time.3. If your girlfriend loves you, she will not expect you to be the only one who calls her more frequently. If your girlfriend hardly call you with the excuse that she doesn't have call credit all the time, then re-evaluate your relationship again!4. If she loves you, she will trust you unconditionally - even when she sees you in the company of other girls. She will not just jump to hasty conclusions 

Well this is interesting. Just understand this, if she really loves you, the first thing is that you will start doubting yourself whether you deserve her or not. And besides “ I love you”, she'll do things unconditionally. If you are really confused, you can look for signs. Tell her you're down with fever and you will find that the only person who is as worried as your mom and sister is your girl. Those hourly calls asking how you feel, have you eaten something, say it all.Tell her to wake you up at an odd hour. Let's say 4am. Trust me, it doesn't matter when she sleeps. She will get up at 3:30

Women are unpredictable beings. They are emotional and they change their minds easily. They can be impulsive and surprising. They can easily fall in love, and later on have a change of heart. This is one of the causes of men’s heartbreaks. However, when a woman matures and experiences true love, she can be so selfless that she becomes so vulnerable. She would not let emotions sway her from side to side. She will be faithful to you. 1. She takes care of you like a mom. You would know how much your girlfriend loves you based on how she takes care of you. Her mother instinct makes her do everythin 

I’d been someone’s girlfriend for 4 years, so I think I can answer this question based on my experience in a serious relationship. You’ll know if your girlfriend really loves you when: She cares for you more than you would even care for yourself; she’ll even encourage you to take supplements and share with you her own vitamins/supplements that she thinks are really good for the health.She can’t wait to tell you stories about her day; she will text/chat you throughout the day even if you don’t reply right away. (Girls are better multi-taskers than boys; it’s a fact)She’ll ask you how’s your day, 

Oh my; this is a question I struggle with myself. We all want to be loved the way we want to be loved. And all of us have different love languages, and different styles and different measurements. So; I can get right down and tell you that it's how she makes you feel loved. But that's not accurate enough because sometimes you can't just base your answer on how you "feel" loved (maybe you cannot "see" or comprehend the level of love she has for you). Since different people show love in their own unique way; let's explore further. I suggest you to take a pen and paper and sit yourself down and try y

What is love?  Like, love, or ‘in love’? Psychological research over the past 50 years has investigated the differences between liking someone, loving someone, and being “in love”. Liking is described as having positive thoughts and feelings towards someone and finding that person’s company rewarding. we frequently also experience warmth and closeness towards the people we like. In some instances, we elect to be emotionally intimate with these people.  When we love someone we experience equivalent positive thoughts and experiences as once we sort of a person. But we also experience a deep sense of c

  Meet this man- Arunachalam Muruganantham, the man who wore a sanitary pad to break a taboo. He defined love not by his words(which anyone can do) but by his actions(which very few can do). He showed what true love really means and he did that by showing his love towards his wife by providing the permanent solution for her wife's problem. One fine day, Arunachalam Muruganantham asked his wife about a dirty rag she was sneaking with. Realizing that she was managing her 'menstrual problem', he was shocked to know that using a sanitary pad would affect the family's budget for milk. Adamant to impre

Love is when your mother doesn’t care what shape, size, form, gender, type you are born with and keeps you close to your heart in every situation. Love is when you don’t care the breed, gender, type of the puppy you see and go Awwww and start to pamper it!

Before I answer the question, I have to ask: Do you guys ever misspell love with live and vice versa? I know I do. Quite strange, isn’t it? Love and life. That reminds me when our life, as infants, are very dependent on parental help. Love therefore has been a mechanism to promote the same parental support of children. According to neurochemistry, neurotransmitters and neuropeptides are what love is. Testosterone, estrogen, dopamine, oxytocin, and vasopressin drive the feeling of what we call 'love'. Central dopamine pathways effect the partner's behavioor. Vasopressin in the ventral pallidum and

I'm probably not capable of answering this question either. But one thing that I have understood is, It's a VARIABLE. For a child , it's a fairy tale. For an old person , it's a solution to loneliness. For the young , it's a profit or loss statement. For a lover , it's the best thing that can ever happen. For a love failure , it's an illogical meaningless emotion. For a man , it's all about

What type of women should you never date?
Are you constantly asking your friends why you can't meet a decent girl? If you find that the women you date always turn out to be annoying or weird in some way, maybe you're just choosing the wrong type of woman. For example, you should beware of the Club Veteran, who has been practically been living in bars and clubs since she hit the legal drinking age, as well as the Mystery Girl, who deliberately tries to confuse you with her elusiveness. Obviously, there isn't just one type of woman that is right for every guy. There are thousands of fish in the sea and you will never find two that are ex 

A2A “What type of women should you never date?” I shall just put this in list format and heavily state that this is personal opinion alone that I go by, and not one I am saying everyone or even the majority goes by. Gold-diggersThey are very noticeable and will drain you dry, often one of their first questions is asking what you do, aka knowing your rough income, and others more bold will actually ask how much said job brings in. They mask many of their questions around “getting” to know you where they are actually assessing your assets. Quick to be discontented or disinterested in “mundane” dat 

Why do I have a fairly short list? Women who are goldiggers: Stay away from leeches please. Always look for strength and ambition in the women you date. Women who are willing to carve their own path and become distinguished by their own effort are usually much better dates than women who leech off your wealth or reputation. This goes for any girl who only dates you to mooch off your status if you possess it.Women who make fun of others in a very mean spirited way: Trust me, it’s a really bad sign. Women who instead of making contextually relevant jokes (like about the weather or a shopping spre

Scared of being rejected, scared of looking like a fool, scared of not being good enough…. I can not tell you how many opportunities and beautiful connections I missed playing this game. Then I tried a different game I heard of the pickup artists and I thought perhaps I am not good enough but 

Because you’re not special enough to have no self esteem. Have you ever noticed how the most average looking guys have the hottest girlfriends? Why are they together then? Well, it happened that the guy was around at the right time. He was probably somewhat normal, confident and witty. And he showed intent without being clingy or pushy. That’s about it in 90% of the cases of a hot girl with an average guy. So the guys who are confident with hot or beautiful women know one thing: Beautiful women are not special (besides their looks obviously). They have the same things going on as everybody else.

I would take the bus to Toronto and had a wait of some hours while he finished his work as a rapid transit driver. This left me plenty of time to go exploring. I had told BF (Bigoted Fascist, patent pending) that I would be at some small mall not far from his  

For a while, I was dating Z. We were both engineering students together, and while I came from a middle class family in the US, he came from a very wealthy family in Egypt. He was charming, funny, and we really, really liked each other. But when I graduated before him, and moved to another city for an internship (soon to be followed by graduate school) we decided breaking up would be best. I was in a new city, starting an exciting new internship, but I was still hung up on Z, so my good friend decided to set me up on a date with “Kevin” (name changed) to help me move on. Kevin was her husband’s  

I was about 25 years old and living in my first apartment with no roommates in the city. I invited some friends over and one of them was riding home with her co-worker’s son. I was on the phone with her while they were still in the car. I asked if she could have him bring her over to the apartment instead. He agreed but only if I agreed to let him meet me because he liked my voice. I was flattered so I said yes. It was no big deal really. I had dated outside of my race before. Although those relationships were a bit more challenging due to cultural differences and a lot of pushback from their f 

There was a Turkish guy from the Netherlands I was dating so that day he called me and we were talking on the phone and I was downstairs waiting for my son to get back from school by the school bus. He was telling me something so I said: “Hold on, I will get back to you a.s.a.p.” and put the phone in my pocket. I did not hang up. I never met that bus driver before, so he introduced himself. This is a small bus that takes kids with special needs (autism etc.) to schools that provide special care they need so it is a normal situation that the bus driver introduces himself to the parents and someti 

This was more xenophobic then racist I guess, but it still left quite a mark. In May I spent a week in Bogota, the capital of Colombia, which if you aren’t aware is right next to Venezeula, a country that is going through a huge crisis. Many citizens of Venezuela simply Can no longer live there due to crime , insane inflation or violence and are immigrating however possible to other places. On my second night in Bogota, I went to a bar and was approached by a very good looking man who introduced himself as Miguel. He spoke English pretty well and with that and my intermediate Spanish we actually 

I am sorry for a lot of experiences I am reading here! Most are absolutely horrid and I am sure my blood would have boiled if anyone ever dared to say something like that to me! My experiences with inter-racial dating have been comparatively innocuous but extremely annoying nevertheless. My fiance is catholic-caucasian btw. For me, race, religion, etc. do not hold much weight when it comes to love and attraction. So to start with, I live in Utah, in which 88.6% of the population is White or European (source: Wikipedia). Being a university student, I am fortunate to live in a diversity hotspot. Ho 

I breifly dated a guy I met online who is black. Before this happened I already knew there was something I didn’t like about his attitude. He seemed like an interesting person, and his profile said he was an artist and gamer. Great, something we could connect over! However, even though I was just as good as he was (or better) he talked down to me and put down my work even though he exclusively produced very amateurish anime. He would also take it out on me and act like a jerk if something completely unrelated had him in a bad mood. He also kept on with that icky “you’re not like ‘other girls’, 

Alright, well let me start by saying I'm Mexican. So, this happened a few years ago when I was a sophomore in college, I was friends with this guy who is almost 10 years older than me, he knew me and my friends since we were in high school. Also, I need to mention that he is Cuban and he only did high school back in his country, a very long time ago. (Which i dont care about but it is an important part of the story). Anyway, so I used to go to my local Barnes &amp; Noble to study like almost everyday, and one day I invited him over to get a cup of coffee and chat. Well, he criticized me the whole ti 

That's really hard to narrow down. As a colored woman on a dating website (OkCupid), I get so many messages where I don't feel like I'm even a person to these guys anymore. I see multiple profile where they list the women they will date, or won't date. Usually the men who do this will write on their profile that they will only date white women, others say that they will only date Whites and Asians but will make an exception for some Hispanics and Blacks. Many of the messages I get feel so awkward with things like "I love Hispanic girls", "You're weirdly attractive", "You're exotic", "oddly hot" 

Not exactly a date but let me explain. In 1998 i was working in Moscow. One summer evening a group of guys i worked with decided we should go to a nightclub. Im not sure who picked “Hippapotam” but thats the one that was selected and thats where we met up. I arrived a little late. Unlike most of my male colleagues i liked to dance - so thats what i did. It marked me out as different because dancing was not popular among russian men in nighclubs. I found myself dancing with several young russian ladies -we were just having fun. Eventually i got tired and retired to the bar for sone kind of soft 

For anyone who felt like they "settled" with someone, what led you to that point, and how did it turn out?
I definitely settled. Why? I had been single for years, I was exhausted from dating and longing to have someone who would love me. My last relationship took away my self esteem and self worth. After 5 years of being single a friend started flirting with me, but I was not interested, even found him physically unattractive. But then another friend said: Aww he is so cute and he really likes you and she told me to not be superficial and give him a chance. And he was so in love with me, but to be honest I was out of his league. Not being arrogant here, but that´s just how it was. I had studied, wa 

Settled? I assume you are asking based on attractiveness or success. Here are some truths in life. I have known the most attractive women and men who married people less attractive than them and, 30 years later, guess who was now more attractive. I have know attractive people who have turned out to be the most unattractive people inside and vice versa. I have seen successful people lose it all and less seccussful people work for years before it suddenly pays off. Or do you mean chemistry between two people? Which invariably fades over the years as comfort sets in. In this world of instagram stars  

“For anyone who felt like they "settled" with someone, what led you to that point, and how did it turn out?” With the perspective of the years I’ve been observing myself and other people, I see this question a bit differently than others who have responded. “Settling” actually isn’t necessarily as simple a matter as saying “oh well, whatever,” and marrying or otherwise committing to someone who isn’t what you originally hoped for. From my own point of view, almost all of human existence includes some level of “Settling,” since pretty much none of the ideals and fantasy versions of life that we be 

This story comes from an older friend. It is one of the most impactful relationship stories I have ever heard. Why did you settle for your partner when you could have done better?  “You’re 34 now Mike. Am I ever going to get my grandkids?” I just nodded my head to mom. “No laugh? Does this mean you’re serious?” I laughed and finished up seeing mom. This time she was right. I sat in the car realising that I really do need to find a nice girl and start a family. I was never really sure how I got to this point. Still on my own. Time seems to sneak up on you until it’s too close to ignore. I have always b 

So I settled for someone. After years of chasing skirts, my friends suggest I should try dating someone who likes me more than I like her. And one day I met her at an event. I would say she's not my type though I did find her mildly attractive at the event where our faces are covered in paint. After the event we went for drinks and things got pretty quick. Right after which, she was expressing her interest in me which makes me feel very doubtful. A friend bumped into her blog accidentally and showed it to me. It should have been really good red flags that she's not a good partner for me. Her life 

I never believed in love at first sight until I met this boy the summer before I started college. He was like something straight out of a movie. He had a strong jawline, green eyes, and dark, messy curls. He had a scar above his eyebrow, and never told me how he got it. He said it was part of the “mystery,” and I think the mystery was part of why I was attracted to him. I had a chain of bad boyfriends throughout school. High school boys were immature, and generally uninteresting assholes, so I wasn’t looking for a relationship right then. But I met him, and all reasoning flew out the 

Settling with someone in today's times sounds so negative, well settling and then letting it waste away is negative. I believe that settling with someone and then building it up together is the right way to do it, but I did not always believe this. So how did I come to this belief. I believe that sex is for marriage and except for fooling around, I was saving it for marriage. Therefore getting married was a high priority for me and I dated mostly girls with the goal of finding one to marry. The problem is that I mostly looked for someone I wanted to marry, but never really considered whether the 

Oh, I settled. I settled big time. I just didn’t know it at the time. Sometimes you meet someone who ticks off all of your compatibility boxes, and this one did: he didn’t have kids or want them; we shared the same political and religious ideologies; we were very close in age; and, of course, physical attraction was present on both parts. All of the intrinsic qualities that should have logically led to a highly successful, happy, lifelong marriage. And had he been any other man, this would have been more than enough. I was deeply in love with him for a time insofar that my mind had painted a pi 

I have in the past been in a relationship that I realised after 7 years that he was with me only because he thought he couldnt do better because he was insecure… never settle for those reasons.. you will hurt the person you are with far more than you could ever know.. I have also settled in other relationships by putting up with behaviour that was less than acceptable or different values.. never do this either.. it will hurt you and your self esteem and trust of others if the person you are with does not treat you well or does not share the same values and makes you compromise what is truly imp 

I ‘settled’ with my husband. I dated a few guys before I married him. And most of them were selfish. Some loved me for my job or for my beauty and one because I was helping him progress at work by doing his reports. Some were boasting about how rich they were and it turned me off. And I could not open up to them. Some cheated on me. When I met my husband, it took a while for me to see that he cares genuinely for me(because of all the bad experiences I have had). We care for each other. He can be himself around me and I can be ME around him. He treats me like a lady and I treat him as a real ma 

When dating, especially online dating, how do I bring up that I'm a loser? I want to be honest but I don't want women to be turned off by the fact that I don't have a lot going for me.
When did being a "nice guy" become a bad thing?
Let’s clarify the ‘nice’ bit here. I’ve recently tried to explain to someone else who didn’t understand why women aren’t fond of ‘Nice Guys™’ and confuses the dislike of ‘Nice’ and the general usage of nice. Being a nice guy is not and has never been a bad thing → Being a ‘Nice Guy™’ is a bad thing. Let’s flip the genders:  Imagine you’re a man and you meet a couple of women at a bar. One of them is a “Nice Girl™”. She’s polite. She’s spent a little time talking to you, asking about your job and family and listening to you talk about your day. She seems nice enough and you don’t mind chatting but  

Look, this is actually quite simple. The narrative around ‘nice guy’ typically goes something like this: Guy encounters some girl, decides he fancies her.Guy interacts with said girl in a nice, polite manner on several occasions.Guy asks said girl to enter a romantic relationship, girl declines.Guy gets upset and demands to know why she won’t be in a relationship with him—he is very nice, after all!Guess what? Being nice to people does not obligate them to date you. It may help you find people willing to spend time with you (though to be fair, some people seem quite willing to hang out with peop 

Perhaps it always has been so: Nice is bland. Nice is expected. Nice doesn’t say anything about who you are, what your interests or passions are, or how you live your life. In many cases, a “nice guy” simply has nothing more interesting to recommend them, and may in fact have a number of things to not recommend them. A “nice guy” probably doesn’t go skydiving or hiking — if he did, he’d be a “skydiver” or “hiker.” A “nice guy” may live with his parents at an age when independence is socially expected, or may retain immature tendencies. A “nice guy” may in some cases think that “being nice” is al 

For me, being a “nice guy” is to be accommodating and agreeable to an exasperating degree and to one which fosters and encourages no connection or interest. No matter a man’s looks, wealth or status then that is not attractive. There is never a sense of the nice guy occasionally taking their own interests into account. When dating they are overtly accommodating to their date, they are doing what they think their date wants to do or they are doing what their date has said they want to do i.e. letting them decide. There is never a sense of the nice guy thinking “…let’s go see that movie I read a 

When the nice guy set himself on fire in order to keep others warm. I think at some point or other, we've all been a nice guy in our lives for someone, we'd let our guards down for them, we'd let their actions sweetly hurt us without ever questioning them, we'd even share the last piece of our favorite food with them, fuck. Nice guy is actually just a sugar-coated and modernized word for Hindi slang term commonly known as Chutiya :). Perhaps the word “nice" here has been misinterpreted with the word “kind", like, what the heck being nice even mean? Being kind at least means something, we should a 

- - The question “why do girls say they want a nice guy but really don’t” has become a touchstone for many men these days. They try to be nice but get rebuffed, leaving them mystified. Maybe if guys understood other men have tried the “nice routine” just to lure women, the problem would be obvious. Women may need to explain to men they don’t have to try so hard to appear nice, just be themselves. If he’s a decent guy it will show in time. And I’m convinced being nice, kind, sharing time and friendship, wanting to be supportive or helpful will always matter regardless of circumstance. A counselor  

Because ‘being nice’ is one of the absolute lowest-level qualifications a person can have to be able to minimally interact and function within the rest of human society. It’s at about the same level as managing to dress yourself before leaving the house. It’s such an easy bar to clear, such a base-level thing, that it doesn’t, or shouldn’t, need to be explicitly stated. You don’t go around telling people you managed to put your own clothes on today. You don’t put it on your CV, you don’t expect it to earn you cookies, you don’t expect it to open doors for you or smooth your path through life. Or  

Indians who know the best of Indian television serials might be familiar with the show Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi which aired on Sony TV in 2016 and 2017. I will introduce you to 3 characters of the show here: Dev DixitSonakshi BoseRitik Sen Dev Dixit Dev Dixit is a rich businessman.He falls in love with Sonakshi and then soon they both are together.But when he comes to know that his mother (whom he considers as his God due to their difficult past) does not like Sonakshi, instead of taking a stand for his love, he breaks up with Sonakshi.After break up, he is unable to move on, still madly loves S

Its not, it never was. Summarizing being meek, not expressing your sexuality, not going for what you want, and being passive with the word nice is what’s wrong. Be nice to people. If you come from a happy and healthy loving family, you will be nice to others. If you have no insecurities you will be nice. You will be happy and spread joy and make other feel good around you. And people(and girls) will love you for that. Try being a jerk to your boss or your professor or your parents and see what returns you get. The only thing is apart from being nice is to be assertive, be outspoken, say what’s on 

When did being a "nice guy" become a bad thing? Euphemism. Being a “nice guy” became a bad thing when douchebags with underhanded seduction techniques started describing themselves as such to hide their blatant misogyny. Here’s a clue — when you need to tell people you’re a nice guy, you’re probably not a nice guy. Inevitably, whenever a man mentions being a nice guy, it’s meant to put down a woman who isn’t interested in dating the speaker. As if they are a decent human being who is being rejected for being decent by a woman who chooses to love someone they determine to be “not a nice guy”. These 

What's it like to date a supermodel?
What should I do? My GF is saying that either we get married or she will dump me. We have a 7-year relationship but I'm still not ready to get married. I love her but she is leaving me unless we arrange a wedding in the next 3 months.
Every relationship gets to a point where you decide to get married or break up. Both of you need to break up. I was in your girlfriend’s shoes. Thankfully I wasted 2, not 7 years of my life with a guy. Those types are never serious nor ready for that level of commitment but too scared of being alone. Same thing; had the DTR with him. Later he surprised me with a beautiful proposal, but shortly after, the engagement was extremely stressful; nothing changed. One day he’s like yes let’s get married and next day oh I’m not sure. It was exhausting. Wedding planning helped me get away from that stress  

Been married several times and I’ve got to give you two ends of the spectrum. On one hand, marriage is for suckers. I mean you’ve been with her for 7 years. What have you not done that you can only do in a marriage? File joint taxes? Guarantee each other’s inheritance? Visit in the hospital? Get on the other’s insurance plan? All stupid reasons to get married. You mentioned something about different countries? Immigration is actually a good reason to get married. Other than that, a cynic would say it sounds like she’s got other plans for you or your fortunes. He’d say “If I was in your shoes, I’ 

My grandma had a saying for this. “Shit. Or get off the pot.” If you don’t know that you want to marry a woman after 7 years (!) of being in a relationship, then you need to figure out your mind and fast. I told my (now) husband after less than a year of dating that I was going to have to make a job decision in the next few months. I needed to have a firm decision from him on whether or not we were going to get married or not before I decided to stay where we were living at the time or move back to be closer to my family. I was not staying without a ring on my finger, or at least a firm propos 

Your gf said that to you? You mean your “girlfriend”? 7 years, and she's still your “gf”. Wow! Seven years she's been acting like your wife, you've been treating her like a wife. Sleeping in her bed each night, nursing you through sickness, washing your clothes, sucking your dick…. 7 fuckin' years you've been sucking the youth out of her and you don't respect that woman enough to ASK HER to honor you by becoming your wife.., and she wants to get married. She should have left you a long time ago. You are abusive and self-centered. If after 7 years you “are not ready”, then you really need to give her 

I had a fiancé just like you. He wasn’t ready after many years, almost 7. I one day got sick of his not being ready to just grow up and figure out what he wanted in life and I left him. Two years later (after being with HIM for 7) I was not only married, I was pregnant. No joke. So all these years later, I am happily married to someone else with a child. Coincidentally, my ex-fiancé lives 7 blocks from my new house. We stayed friends on FB, and I got a little concerned about the fact that we both live in the same small town. I looked up his address, wanting to be sure I wasn’t going to run int 

Wow this sounds familiar. I also had a 7-year relationship, in which she wanted to get married and I “wasn’t ready to.” I have to say, your girlfriend is being pretty kind, respectful, and vulnerable to express her needs to you. My girlfriend simply got frustrated, and ended the relationship. In fact, I think most women would just leave. What you have to understand is that your girlfriend loves you, but she also has important life goals which include marriage and probably family. These are very important to her. What you should ask yourself is “Why am I not ready?” For me, there were some important as 

This is a tough &amp; hard question to answer since so many variables can affect you &amp; your decision so I’m just going to try and do this on a basic and “Man to Man” kind of talk. As you’ve said, you have a 7 year long relationship and I will presume that you &amp; her are “In Love” , that you both do truly care for one another and enjoy time spent with each other and consider the past 7+ years a good investment of time. You then need to ask yourself “Why am I not ‘Ready’ for Marriage”? What is holding you back ? What are you afraid of ? What else do you feel you need to do before you feel like you wil 

I knew a guy once that was in a 5 year relationship but he just wasn’t ready to “settle down”. I talked with him a bunch of times about it because he was such a nice and kind guy and the girl was the love of his life and he would only ever get married and have children with her, he said. He couldn’t explain why not now. She was patient and seemed to be okay with the arrangement though. Fast forward 6 years. Whatever barrier makes the thought of being committed so impossible to him has not diminished. She is now in her late-ish 30s and he knows she wants kids. So he tells her she should forget h 

This is such a great question and I’m so glad you made the decision to ask it. NEVER let someone pressure you into marriage! PERIOD! Marriage is a TREMENDOUS commitment and an AWESOME responsibility! If you are not ready, you are NOT READY! NO ONE should pressure someone into marriage and, quite frankly, no one should WANT to pressure someone into marriage! People who want to get married, but are with a partner who feels they are not ready, can ALWAYS leave and go meet someone else, but NO ONE should ever pressure someone into getting married! Let me offer you some thoughts. Many women and men  

Generally, I think giving ultimatums are distasteful. However, context matters, and in the context of a 7 year relationship, I don't think its particularly unreasonable. What you need to do is to be honest with yourself. Question 1: Do you want to marry her? Possible answers: No. If this is your answer, I think its obvious that you have an irreconcilable difference. Your relationship is over, maybe it even lasted too long. You have to accept this and move on, and allow her move on.Maybe/I'm not sure. If this is your answer, we'll come back to that shortly.Yes, but not in 3 months. This also requir

What makes a man fall in love with a woman?
Man falls in love with a woman because.. His number desire the need and want for approval and validation. This can mean many ways of showing that; and I can mention some. That she shows him affection, she behaves in a feminine way in recipocrating his flirtatious ways and she shows vulnerability to him. She makes him feel special, needed, wanted in her life. When she sees him or hears from him she is excited, it feels like she has been waiting to hear from him. He is wanted. He is needed. He is loved. How so many women especially young women fail in this first one is crazy. You’d not believe 

From the answers here I say most men have certain (sometimes bizzare!) fantasies, but actually have no idea - or are unwilling to tell - what actually makes them ‘fall in love’ with a women. My answer is not pretty. I am going to tell the truth about men regards women they ‘fall in love’ with and marry.  Basically, a man falls in love with the woman who can best fulfill his EGO. But every man has different ego needs. One man may prize women who are high maintenance, as this fulfills their ego need of being the partner of someone who is high status (which can lend him the status which he lack on hi 

Well, in some cases, utter and complete stupidity and naiveté. In other cases? Physical appearance. In yet others, personality, actions, and the whole kit n kaboodle. There are millions of differing reasons, but ultimately, there are some basic things that do tend to do it. Here's a few of the more usual suspects: Old fashioned gender roles: The woman makes the man feel like a man, virile, like a good provider, and an overall good person. It can feel like a natural high, and who wouldn't want a feeling like that as often as possible, eh? Excuse me for a minute. My wife needs me to open a jar of

Women are sensitive. Some it is really difficult to assure of a lady is truly in love with you or not. Girls are so coquettish so not every man can manage to recognize their mood at first view. Anything that arouses Interest in a person also attracts her. If a girl holds her kook on to you for long, then you can defiantly talk about her interest. Although it's too early to tell about falling in love. Love can make a girl do tyle o clothes, change interests. You must appreciate such a girl who can change her lifestyle just to impress you. A woman in love will be looking for an opportunity with  

just Penned down some incomplete thoughts … “A man falls in love when he feels like he could be a super hero with you in his life. When he feels accepted, appreciated and understood, and knows he can make you happy…he will be yours.

It was late night, her lines dug deep in her face, the light from the crackling fire told us she lived a long life, with lots of pain because he back so arched, and she was alone, and has been for other half of her 80 year life on planet earth. And she suddenly flowed with the gems of how she screwed up with not just one man of her life but THREE. It was like a man falling in love with her escaped her everytime she thought she got him. Moment she discovered the answer to her question, she added.. “It was far too late. I was now in my 50s and ended up in a fast world you young ones now live in, bu 

Why Man Fall in Love with a women? That seems to be the elusive million dollar question. But … it’s not so elusive. Women can’t always see it clearly because women typically have a goal from the start, the goal being to get a commitment and have that rare, once in a lifetime, loving relationship. But what causes men to fall in love with a woman? What makes one woman special and unique? He feels seen and appreciated for who he is. Men are absolutely starved for appreciation. You may not realize it because he probably doesn’t come right out and ask for it, but you’ll see the effect it has on him whe 

Well, I will answer this question from a woman’s perspective. I mean to say what a woman thinks can make a man fall for her. Certainly, men-women falling for each other is a natural instinct. But, when it comes to the point of what makes a man fall in love with a woman, the touchstones are as follows: How she looks and makes herself presentable in different occasions at different times of the day in different outfitsHer intelligence that glows in her eyes and makes her different from the rest of the worldHow she at the same time be tender and rough, whatsoever and whenever requiredHer emotional

Recently a famous Hollywood actor married a pornstar. She still has her profile on the Hookup Site. When asked what made him fell in love in an interview, here are his reason below.  Honesty: Someone that is brutally honest. Not someone that just tells you what you want to hear. Even if it jeopardizes the relationship itself, honesty goes a long way. Trust: There can’t be love with no trust. Trust is earned and not given away. And from my experience, it’s hard to find. Loyalty: Someone that goes through your life in good and bad. Has your back in the bad times, not just the good. They support you  

1.Women as the safest place for him to go on the planet Your arms, eyes, and lap, those have to be a refuge for him. If you become the safest place on the planet for his heart’s secret needs; he will never leave. 2. Women who make them feel like they matter Appreciate him when he goes out of his way to buy a gift or provide you with much-needed emotional support. Tell him that he made a difference in your life. 3. Women who accept them for who they are If you can encourage him to be his authentic self, it makes you extremely approachable and lovable. When he feels safe and comfortable, he’ll open u 

How do married people stay in love with their spouse when they are old, wrinkled, and grey?
I’m not quite wrinkled yet but I’m definitely past mid-life so the grey hairs have well and truly taken over. My husband and I have now reached the point where we’ve been together longer than we’ve lived apart. We met in Santorini, Greece, a few decades ago, when neither of us were necessarily looking to fall in love. He was on his way to Gallipoli to visit his great grand-father’s grave, while I had just finished university in France and wanted to spend the rest of my summer in Greece. He was the first person I remember meeting on my second day on the island. I suppose everybody was new and i 

Hmmm… let me try to answer this. When I first met my wife I thought she was crazy beautiful. I was not, however, in love with her. I didn’t know her but saw her from afar. To me she was like beautiful art. Truly gorgeous. Then I got to know her. We became best friends first. No sexual relationship. Just friends. I then learned that she was truly beautiful inside also. This is why I began to fall in love with her. It was not because of her looks, it was because of the person she is. So now we have been married for 27 years. Perhaps she is not as physically beautiful as she was back then. She is, h 

If you marry your spouse of the same age give and take about five years different then you will grow old together. Men and women will have wrinkles , white hair, arthritic joints, and all signs of ageing. If you have loving kindness for each other then you will be together until death do us apart. You will have your children to comfort you in your old age. Many men in their fifties committed adultery normally with a woman young enough to be his daughter because of unrealistic expectations . Be realistic it is your dollars which will attract some of this young women to your old body . Many an o 

I can only speak for myself and not for old, married couples. I’m still young and unmarried, but here’s my input anyway. I do not plan to marry any woman for her physical appearance. I want a woman with a certain type of personality and mindset. Physical appearances change over time, but good personalities can remain the same or even improve as spouses grow older. I will always associate my future wife’s physical appearance with her positive qualities which I’ll greatly treasure for life. When she’s old, wrinkled and grey, we will have spent so much time together and experienced so many positiv 

When I met my now wife, she was a young 26year old with long blond hair, she was the most beautiful person I had ever seen and way out of my league. Anyway I started to chat to her online, it was wonderful even though I was 16 years her senior she made me feel at ease with all we talked about, I had just come out of a loveless relationship and honestly thought I would be alone for the rest of my life. As time passed I grew close to her Sam, and looked forward to getting home from work every day so I could log on and chat to her, I would tell her about my day and she would tell me about hers, I  

You begin by choosing your partner wisely. You don't settle. You must ask yourself: Is this person the love of your life? Is this person someone you find difficult to be apart from? Is this someone who compliments you and your lifestyle? I've heard people say about the companion they're with, “She's (or he's) a good person.” Yes, that's all well and good, but it's not enough. Do they light a fire of passion within you? Do you find it hard to keep your hands off them? Next month, my wife and I will celebrate 47 years of marriage, although we've been together a lot longer having met when we were 

Being in love isn't the same thing as being in lust. All people get old and grey if they are lucky, there is no avoiding that. There is also no human right that states that we all deserve to be with someone that stays hot for their entire life. Doesn't it sound silly to expect that when you think of it that way? Everyone would be single, that's not even feasible. When you love someone, you like their personality and being with them. That doesn't necessarily go away. If you were attracted to them in the beginning, that attraction is strengthened by love. An old grey husband still looks like his y 

If you need a perfect, in-context example of what love is, read James Meszaros’ previous response to this question. If you want to understand on a more conceptual level, I’ll try to explain here… To begin with, this question conflates love with lust. And this is problematic. As a former high school English teacher, I used to spend quite a bit of time working through the difference with my students. (Note: this conversation wasn’t off-topic, as Romeo and Juliet was part of the core curriculum.) This is what I used to tell them: Sonnet 116 by William Shakespeare (reprinted below for ease) is the mos 

In the event that you marry your better half of the identical age give and take about 5 years different then you'll definitely grow old together. Both women and men may have lines and wrinkles , white tresses, arthritic bones, and all signs of ageing. When you have loving-kindness per other then you will be together until demise do united states aside. You will have your young ones to comfort you within old age. A lot of men within their fifties committed adultery normally with a female younger adequate to be their girl as a result of unrealistic expectations . Be practical it is your dollars  

Old, wrinkled, and grey? Sheesh, sonny. I bet you're a real charmer with the ladies, eh? Come closer, I can't hear ya. Ok, well…because it's too darn annoying to get up and move and start all over when you're old, wrinkled, and grey. That's why! Your joints ache, your back gives out on an almost daily basis, and gods forbid you should trip over something. You'll fall and break your dang hip. That hurts! Have you ever fallen, and not been able to get up? It's not nearly as fun as it sounds, let me tell ya. For the ones that last, part of how it happens is that you've been together for years, you 

What happened in that moment when you realized you are in love with your significant other?
I was friends with my boyfriend for a year before we got together. We talked every day. We went out together. We laughed together. I loved him - as a friend. Four days after we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend, exactly one month ago, I had a date night planned with him, but his roommate got sick, and we had to cancel. I was in the middle of moving into my flat, and had no furniture, food, or stuff to do. He stopped by at lunch time with pizza, flowers, strawberries, and ice cream. We ate, using a moving box as a table. We cuddled on a blanket on the floor. He told me I was beautiful, cal 

When I realized that I was in too deep. We started dating during my senior year and his first year of college after knowing each for three years. I had been single for a long time with the intention that I was not going to continue dating just to prove that I was worthy of having a boyfriend. Sure, dating happened, but the other parties knew that they would not become my significant other. He wanted a relationship with me and was forward about it, clearly stating his intentions. That got my respect and I told him that we could explore our options and if a foundation existed for trust and respect 

I had just gotten back from being away from home for about 10 months. My ex, who I lived with during that time in New Orleans, Louisiana I had caught cheating and needless to say I was in pretty rough shape. I was very confused, very hurt, and so very tired from being up for 48 hours. Thankfully the drive back home gave me much needed time to think and process what had happened but the one thing that I kept coming back to was being excited to be going back home. Despite being in that state my thoughts always strayed back to my best friend and I couldn’t contain the feeling of being absolutely e 

If you were to die tomorrow, I would treasure these two amazing dates we’ve shared. And, if you were to die in a month, I would have had a month to get to know you. And, if you were to die in six months, I would have had the chance to fall in love with you. Anything after that is icing on the cake. Those were the words she used to tell me that she was comfortable dating a man with late-stage cancer. Here we are. This photo sits in a frame at the top of the stairs to our second-floor living room, in our home.  In May of last year, I was in dating mode. I had a profile on a few dating apps, and I ha 

I've known my boyfriend since I was twelve years old. We were friends for a year or two, then we started to be friends who held hands, and then friends who kissed, and as we got older our relationship just kept changing. We still talked about history, watched Hank Green videos together, and fought over the proper way to solve social justice issues, but we physically started to be closer. We never dated, but we knew we were friends who also had feelings for each other that weren't platonic. We blamed it on teenage hormones for a long time. Sometimes we would stop doing our friends with benefits 

I had known my husband for 6 years before he finally asked me out. There was an opportunity where we were both single and finally set our sights on each other. I had gotten my wisdom teeth surgically removed the morning after our first date. I developed serious dry socket infections in all four gaping wounds in my mouth where the teeth were dug out. It was the most painful and horrible experience of my life up to this point. Childbirth didn’t even come close. My mom was looking after me in the days following my surgery. I couldn’t function from the pain, couldn’t get out of bed, and I kept throw 

The first time I saw her…well, our eyes didn’t meet, I was straining to catch some more subtle elements. Her thick wavy hair won’t permit, they sheathed most of her face. Some days later, our eyes met. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I was transfixed for a little longer than normal. She claims to have no memory of it though. The day I heard that coy girl speak for the first time, I loved it. That was the day I took up that botched up mission of asking for her notes, ended up asking her equally pretty friend. I quickly transformed from an insignificant-nobody to a buffoon, that wasn’t funny at al 

Ours was a complete arrange marriage. During our 10 months of courtship (a long distance one) though we got along well but I was not entirely happy with the course of our relationship. It was not anything even an inch similar to what it is shown in movies or I have seen happening with my cousins and friends, where the two people either since day 1 or sometimes later are in head over heels love with each other. I even confronted him regarding my insecurity to which his reply always remained the same, he constantly made me understand that we are living apart and contacting over texts/phones so th 

When i realized i actually wanted to do things with him, when i was willing to put in effort. Before my current boyfriend and i began seeing each other in December’s 2018, I was having a rough year. Had just graduated high school, had spent 10 months of that year in an unhappy relationship where i was abused, undermined, and ignored. I finally told my ex to hit the road when our 3 year anniversary had rolled around and I was drunk 3 hours away from his university. It was a difficult breakup. He stalked me for months after.

I missed her. We were friends for years, having met in church. I always got the feeling that she liked me, but she drove me crazy. We kind of drove each other crazy, actually. We were asked to lead church events together, because we were good at it, but that often led to fights because she had trouble seeing how often I had the correct perspective on things… :-) She was about as different from me as anyone could be, so if there were two ways to do something, guaranteed we each chose a different way. We had lots of fun dates over the years with our other friends, just casual stuff. Game nights, di 

What was the best relationship advice you ever got?
My boyfriend and I have been in love for eight years, we had sweets and quarrels, but we are still loving. This period requires long-term effort, time and sincerity. Looking back, I have these suggestions in my relationship that I want to tell you, and I hope it will help you. 1. Give each other appropriate space and trust.  You need a space to enjoy yourself, drink afternoon tea with your girlfriends or go shopping together, and boys also need time to simply play games and exercise with their brothers. You don't need to know exactly what he is doing all the time. You can sublimate yourself in thi 

This is from my (female) experience (top 5): DO NOT SETTLE: Why? Because if you do, you are telling yourself this is the best that is out there and you don’t deserve better. You are also saying, if I settle, at least I won’t be lonely, don’t have to work, can just stay home, take care of the kids, feed the pets, or finally have some financial security. Really? Ask yourself if being lonely is someone else’s problem or just yours. Furthermore, even if you settle you may still feel lonely afterwards. And what about not having to work and just stay at home? This sounds cozy, but does it take all da

I hope that I don’t come across as too self-aggrandising, but the best relationship advice that I ever received was probably from myself. I had stayed in relationship for too long with someone who treated me appallingly as she felt that she was too good for me. She also told me on numerous occasion that she was embarrassed to be with me as she felt that she could do so much better and to twist the knife she told me a lie story that everyone had said the same to her. I’m no psychologist, but I should hazard a guess that this was either to mask her own deep rooted insecurities, or would say these  

Here are some suggestions that I have practiced, which are very useful. In China, interpersonal relationship can even be regarded as a science. With the change of young people's ideas in the 21st century, we are pushing China's interpersonal relationship to become more modern and more bordered. Asians born before the 21st century should attach great importance to the order of the young and the old, especially Koreans. China pays more attention to family relations, visiting each other and giving gifts on holidays. Especially Mid-Autumn Festival, Dragon Boat Festival and Lunar New Year. Chinese frien 

The most shocking realization of an idealist cinephile: Life is not like in the movies I stood there patiently waiting for love to find me, with popcorn in my hand and the heart on my sleeve. I did everything right, according to every script I ever saw. I had my fair share of drama, gave away second chances like free coupons, paired efforts with compromises and loved foolishly. Movies taught me about love. They cemented a predefined vision of love that was impossible to shake off later in life. Every relationship I’ve embarked on followed a playbook I knew to be true and that went a somewhere al 

Love yourself first.Don’t talk about your ex. Please don’t. What’s in the past stays in the past.Don’t rush things. Be slow and let time show you the next step.Never get involved in a relationship just because of pressure. Some people try to hold on a relationship until they find something better, or feel they can change the other person to fit what they want.

hi everyone. I would like to share some advice about relationships I have sum up today ,hope you guys will like it. 1. It's not age that brings you into marriage, it's love. 2. Always keep 20% mystery. Unreserved women, like a movie that has been spoiled, snuffed out the idea of letting men see the ending. 3. Cherish the boys who reason with you. Reason for you is that he is seriously planning for your future, and he hopes to create the future with you. 4. Material is not the most important factor in emotion, but it must exist. 5. Most of the pain in love comes from three expectations: He must be th 

This is what I've learnt over the past 8 years of my life Date with a purpose. Even if you're dating just to have sex, let your intentions be loud and clear. In the end the other party can never accuse you of wasting their time.Take time for yourself after a breakup. Finding another mate to help you “forget" your troubles might work temporarily but you'll only end up in furthur problems and end up hurting the other person along the way.If you know what you're looking for in a partner don't get sidetracked and date the opposite. Sure, it might work for a while but eventually all of the differenc

Women are motivated by love and feeling cherished, men are motivated by respect and feeling needed.When a woman is having a rough day and is opening up to you, don’t immediately give advice. Women open up because they want men to listen.When a woman says: “You never care”, “You never make me happy”, “You never apologize”. She doesn’t literally mean that you never do any of these, this is just how she expresses her feelings in the moment, so take it easy and don’t get defensive.Men sometimes demand the right to have some space from time to time and not to continuously express their feelings whe

This was a long time ago when I was still young and always got caught looking at girls. Like father like son I guess. One day I was staring at this girl who is now my fiance and decided to go talk to her and I just directly told her that she looks fine as hell today and she was a shy girl and she just turned red and said thank you. I told her “did you like when I told you that?” and she just nodded. I told her “honestly I like you more than other girls here, you actually look cute” she turned even more red and I told her goodbye. My friend just stared at me and said “did you seriously just say

I was in the middle of moving into my flat, and had no furniture, food, or stuff to do. He stopped by at lunch time with pizza, flowers, strawberries, and ice cream. We ate, using a moving box as a table. We cuddled on a blanket on the floor. He told me I was beautiful, cal 

When I realized that I was in too deep. We started dating during my senior year and his first year of college after knowing each for three years. I had been single for a long time with the intention that I was not going to continue dating just to prove that I was worthy of having a boyfriend. Sure, dating happened, but the other parties knew that they would not become my significant other. He wanted a relationship with me and was forward about it, clearly stating his intentions. That got my respect and I told him that we could explore our options and if a foundation existed for trust and respect 

I had just gotten back from being away from home for about 10 months. My ex, who I lived with during that time in New Orleans, Louisiana I had caught cheating and needless to say I was in pretty rough shape. I was very confused, very hurt, and so very tired from being up for 48 hours. Thankfully the drive back home gave me much needed time to think and process what had happened but the one thing that I kept coming back to was being excited to be going back home. Despite being in that state my thoughts always strayed back to my best friend and I couldn’t contain the feeling of being absolutely e 

If you were to die tomorrow, I would treasure these two amazing dates we’ve shared. And, if you were to die in a month, I would have had a month to get to know you. And, if you were to die in six months, I would have had the chance to fall in love with you. Anything after that is icing on the cake. Those were the words she used to tell me that she was comfortable dating a man with late-stage cancer. Here we are. This photo sits in a frame at the top of the stairs to our second-floor living room, in our home.  In May of last year, I was in dating mode. I had a profile on a few dating apps, and I ha 

I've known my boyfriend since I was twelve years old. We were friends for a year or two, then we started to be friends who held hands, and then friends who kissed, and as we got older our relationship just kept changing. We still talked about history, watched Hank Green videos together, and fought over the proper way to solve social justice issues, but we physically started to be closer. We never dated, but we knew we were friends who also had feelings for each other that weren't platonic. We blamed it on teenage hormones for a long time. Sometimes we would stop doing our friends with benefits 

I had known my husband for 6 years before he finally asked me out. There was an opportunity where we were both single and finally set our sights on each other. I had gotten my wisdom teeth surgically removed the morning after our first date. I developed serious dry socket infections in all four gaping wounds in my mouth where the teeth were dug out. It was the most painful and horrible experience of my life up to this point. Childbirth didn’t even come close. My mom was looking after me in the days following my surgery. I couldn’t function from the pain, couldn’t get out of bed, and I kept throw 

The first time I saw her…well, our eyes didn’t meet, I was straining to catch some more subtle elements. Her thick wavy hair won’t permit, they sheathed most of her face. Some days later, our eyes met. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I was transfixed for a little longer than normal. She claims to have no memory of it though. The day I heard that coy girl speak for the first time, I loved it. That was the day I took up that botched up mission of asking for her notes, ended up asking her equally pretty friend. I quickly transformed from an insignificant-nobody to a buffoon, that wasn’t funny at al 

Ours was a complete arrange marriage. During our 10 months of courtship (a long distance one) though we got along well but I was not entirely happy with the course of our relationship. It was not anything even an inch similar to what it is shown in movies or I have seen happening with my cousins and friends, where the two people either since day 1 or sometimes later are in head over heels love with each other. I even confronted him regarding my insecurity to which his reply always remained the same, he constantly made me understand that we are living apart and contacting over texts/phones so th 

When i realized i actually wanted to do things with him, when i was willing to put in effort. Before my current boyfriend and i began seeing each other in December’s 2018, I was having a rough year. Had just graduated high school, had spent 10 months of that year in an unhappy relationship where i was abused, undermined, and ignored. I finally told my ex to hit the road when our 3 year anniversary had rolled around and I was drunk 3 hours away from his university. It was a difficult breakup. He stalked me for months after. Sending me pictures of his self mutilation, walking all over his city at  

I missed her. We were friends for years, having met in church. I always got the feeling that she liked me, but she drove me crazy. We kind of drove each other crazy, actually. We were asked to lead church events together, because we were good at it, but that often led to fights because she had trouble seeing how often I had the correct perspective on things… :-) She was about as different from me as anyone could be, so if there were two ways to do something, guaranteed we each chose a different way. We had lots of fun dates over the years with our other friends, just casual stuff. Game nights, di 

What was the best relationship advice you ever got?
My boyfriend and I have been in love for eight years, we had sweets and quarrels, but we are still loving. This period requires long-term effort, time and sincerity. Looking back, I have these suggestions in my relationship that I want to tell you, and I hope it will help you. 1. Give each other appropriate space and trust.  You need a space to enjoy yourself, drink afternoon tea with your girlfriends or go shopping together, and boys also need time to simply play games and exercise with their brothers. You don't need to know exactly what he is doing all the time. You can sublimate yourself in thi 

This is from my (female) experience (top 5): DO NOT SETTLE: Why? Because if you do, you are telling yourself this is the best that is out there and you don’t deserve better. You are also saying, if I settle, at least I won’t be lonely, don’t have to work, can just stay home, take care of the kids, feed the pets, or finally have some financial security. Really? Ask yourself if being lonely is someone else’s problem or just yours. Furthermore, even if you settle you may still feel lonely afterwards. And what about not having to work and just stay at home? This sounds cozy, but does it take all da

I hope that I don’t come across as too self-aggrandising, but the best relationship advice that I ever received was probably from myself. I had stayed in relationship for too long with someone who treated me appallingly as she felt that she was too good for me. She also told me on numerous occasion that she was embarrassed to be with me as she felt that she could do so much better and to twist the knife she told me a lie story that everyone had said the same to her. I’m no psychologist, but I should hazard a guess that this was either to mask her own deep rooted insecurities, or would say these  

Here are some suggestions that I have practiced, which are very useful. In China, interpersonal relationship can even be regarded as a science. With the change of young people's ideas in the 21st century, we are pushing China's interpersonal relationship to become more modern and more bordered. Asians born before the 21st century should attach great importance to the order of the young and the old, especially Koreans. China pays more attention to family relations, visiting each other and giving gifts on holidays. Especially Mid-Autumn Festival, Dragon Boat Festival and Lunar New Year. Chinese frien 

The most shocking realization of an idealist cinephile: Life is not like in the movies I stood there patiently waiting for love to find me, with popcorn in my hand and the heart on my sleeve. I did everything right, according to every script I ever saw. I had my fair share of drama, gave away second chances like free coupons, paired efforts with compromises and loved foolishly. Movies taught me about love. They cemented a predefined vision of love that was impossible to shake off later in life. Every relationship I’ve embarked on followed a playbook I knew to be true and that went a somewhere al 

Love yourself first.Don’t talk about your ex. Please don’t. What’s in the past stays in the past.Don’t rush things. Be slow and let time show you the next step.Never get involved in a relationship just because of pressure. Some people try to hold on a relationship until they find something better, or feel they can change the other person to fit what they want. Chances are high that this isn’t gonna work and you will hurt their feelings later.Never date someone after a breakup. You don’t know if he chose you because of love or obviously because he wants to forget his ex.When a woman ask you a q

hi everyone. I would like to share some advice about relationships I have sum up today ,hope you guys will like it. 1. It's not age that brings you into marriage, it's love. 2. Always keep 20% mystery. Unreserved women, like a movie that has been spoiled, snuffed out the idea of letting men see the ending. 3. Cherish the boys who reason with you. Reason for you is that he is seriously planning for your future, and he hopes to create the future with you. 4. Material is not the most important factor in emotion, but it must exist. 5. Most of the pain in love comes from three expectations: He must be th 

This is what I've learnt over the past 8 years of my life Date with a purpose. Even if you're dating just to have sex, let your intentions be loud and clear. In the end the other party can never accuse you of wasting their time.Take time for yourself after a breakup. Finding another mate to help you “forget" your troubles might work temporarily but you'll only end up in furthur problems and end up hurting the other person along the way.If you know what you're looking for in a partner don't get sidetracked and date the opposite. Sure, it might work for a while but eventually all of the differenc

Women are motivated by love and feeling cherished, men are motivated by respect and feeling needed.When a woman is having a rough day and is opening up to you, don’t immediately give advice. Women open up because they want men to listen.When a woman says: “You never care”, “You never make me happy”, “You never apologize”. She doesn’t literally mean that you never do any of these, this is just how she expresses her feelings in the moment, so take it easy and don’t get defensive.Men sometimes demand the right to have some space from time to time and not to continuously express their feelings whe

This was a long time ago when I was still young and always got caught looking at girls. Like father like son I guess. One day I was staring at this girl who is now my fiance and decided to go talk to her and I just directly told her that she looks fine as hell today and she was a shy girl and she just turned red and said thank you. I told her “did you like when I told you that?” and she just nodded. I told her “honestly I like you more than other girls here, you actually look cute” she turned even more red and I told her goodbye. My friend just stared at me and said “did you seriously just say 

Would you be willing to be friends with someone who had different political views than you?
It's an interesting question. Now that you've forced me to sit down and think about my friends and their views, I'm actually surprised that I have very few friends in real life who would actually mirror my views politically. I would say there are maybe three friends who I could reliably call on to back me up on my social democracy agenda, one of whom is a little prone to being led by conspiracies and as such is a bit of a wild card and a bit cringey. I don't know anyone in real life further to the left of me, but I think I'm probably seen as something of a bootlicker to the real hard left so I do 

This question is not merely a personal one. It is also a question that, in regards to the United States, has significant relevance for the entire nation. This year has seen political and social divides deepen in this country. People on both sides of the political spectrum are no longer seeing themselves as one nation anymore. This is very dangerous for the long term stability of the United States. Ultimately, I think that values are important. I won't be dishonest and say that it is easy to be friends with someone who has a different view or perspective on essential issues. Nevertheless, one wo 

Well yeah, The funny thing about political views is they tend to change. Its not a religion or a cult, it’s malleable. Sure you get the odd person who is a die-hard x or y but generally thats out of ignorance or stubbornness. I know people who always support the same party because they support something they founded on 100 years ago or whatever that was resolved 95 years ago but sure whatever :P. Nearly every political parties views and intent changes over the years. Most people dont see the other side of the argument.  Here in Ireland one of the big issues at the moment is housing and there is a  

Of course. I think the ability to be friends with someone with differing political views than yourself depends upon the depth and breadth of those views. I do think for friendships to happen, the would-be friends *do* need to agree upon some aspects of life, just like anything else. Think of it like anything else in life. You probably met your friends through mutual hobbies and tastes. If you somehow became friends with someone (maybe you both like to knit or you both are enthusiasts for cats or something), but it turns out you have different tastes in movies. Let’s say you like RomComs and hate  

Well, of course. First of all, “different” doesn’t necessarily mean “opposite”. You may agree on some issues and disagree on others and, unless it’s something absolutely vital - not a big deal. Secondly, there are many people who are just not particularly interested in politics,and sometimes their different views are actually views they never really thought through. They just learnt at some point what’s good and what’s bad and never cared enough to analyse. For example, something like “Free education for everybody!” sounds tempting, until you realise that education is not sunshine or water in th 

Absolutely, because I have many friends whose political views differ from mine. Sometimes these differences are minor, sometimes they are quite large. It is important, In my opinion, especially in today’s polarized AF political climate to actively seek out as friends, those whose political beliefs are different from our own. Too often, today, the response to views that differ from our own is a knee jerk combination of distrust, disgust, and vilification if not outright dehumanization of those #%*~$&amp;@ “Republicrats” oops sorry, I meant “Demublicans”. We’ve become a barely cohesive pressure cooker 

For me, my political views are not random preferences or a team affiliation; they derive directly from a coherent ethic of how people should treat one another — peacefully, voluntarily, consensually, win-win. So, it’s a caution flag when I meet someone who has a different political view from me. My friends do not necessarily share my political views, but they do share my ethics, and so given a political view that contradicts the ethic, I do have to investigate further.  Because if she is in fact someone who holds the opposite ethic — that it is okay to treat other people with violence, coercion,  

Would you be willing to be friends with someone who had different political views than you? I would and I do. My friends are a mixed bunch of liberals and conservatives along with at least 2 libertarians. I honestly cannot fathom the life most of the people who answer these types of questions have. It seems like a lot of you spend an inordinate amount of times talking politics in your day to day lives. I tried to write a semi political blog once at the urging of some friends but it didn't last long. I just don't wake up pissed off enough at the world to pull it off. I could never be the kind of per 

Interesting question. I feel a bit ashamed to say that I don't think I could be friends with someone who has different views than I do. The thing is that my political views are based on philosophical and moral thinking that is very strongly held. In other words, I can divide people into good and bad based on their moral opinions. I find that political opinions are based on moral opinions. So, for example, Republicans are big on this idea that they call personal responsibility. They believe that a person's circumstances are irrelevant. If you accept personal responsibility, regardless of ability 

RE: “Can you be friends with someone who has different political views than yourself?” My initial reaction to this question was that I don't choose friendships on the basis of political views, but that's no longer true. Anyone who is a Drumpf supporter is an immediate block from my life. They have nothing of value to offer and their toxic ignorance is a destructively caustic influence on society. AFAIAC, they need to undergo a significant degree of psychological counseling and an education to correct them of their egregious wilfull ignorance. Anyone who proudly declares themselves a conservative

What is the cutest photo of you and your significant other?
Now here’s the real problem in posting one picture of one significant person. There are many people who puts up significance in your life and are needed to be highlighted !! Like way if I just start with, the first person in my mind is 1. My Dad &lt;3 Having him is the real blessing for me. He’s surely the coolest dad in town. We both can discuss almost anything together, hang-out togther and share drinks together. He always puts up trust in me which make me more connected to him.  “We both love beer” 2. My MOM &lt;3 She puts up equal significance in my life. The most prettiest woman I have ever seen. ( I ser 

The way I look at her. Love. Fondness. Awestruck. Admiration.  And the way she looks at me. Seriously, Tapesh. WTF.  Dancing to the tunes at our first DJ night. Things I learnt that night… She is an amazing dancer.Tappu can't dance salla. A long solitary stroll in the lap of Himalayas. I still remember each and every word of the conversation we had.  Enjoying the ice-cold water on our feet at Kullu. She loves swimming and playing in the water. I have a phobia of large water bodies. But when we are together, I'd forget even a gunshot to the heart.  A memorable evening tea in the forests of Dalhousie. I talked, a 

My husband and I are what I like to call a “hybrid family”. He's Polish-American and I am Bangladeshi-American. Our backgrounds could not be any more different, yet we are two peas in a pod. He's my number one support system and my best friend. Here's a couple of pictures of us throughout the years.  Here's him proposing to me at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC.  In the Polish culture, the bride does a bridal dance. Everyone pays to dance with her, and at the end, the groom has to pay his price and everyone tries to stop him from “stealing the bride away”. That's my dad trying to stop him from 

Saw some really amazing photos of couples and it felt so good to see people happy in love. Let me share some of mine :) We bonded over food. On our first date, I gulped down almost an entire plate of Biryani, leaving him almost nothing. Ever since we have been food companions exploring out different places in Bangalore. This one is from Permit Room (South Indian Food in Western Style)  We usually ended up being colour coded quite often even when we weren’t trying. Here’s two of them:   Then, there’s me wearing his new t-shirt before he could even touch it  Here’s me trying to photobomb his selfie.  This  

My girlfriend doesn't have social media (smart woman!), so I thought I'd share this for her. This was on the 4th of July. I met her in college, and we didn't even know each other until the 2017 spring semester concluded. I'm excited to go back this fall with this lady. Her heart is about as golden and genuine as her smile. Her name is McKenna. (I guess when you're both photographers, you get some pretty cute photos together) EDIT: I gave the bottom photo to her as a gift last weekend, and this was her reaction. I'm absolutely in love with this woman. Taken on our 2nd date - July 4th, 2017  Taken on 

My girlfriend and I attend the same university, which means we have the luxury of spending lots of time together. But when we’re on breaks from school, connecting can be a bit harder. My parents live in Baltimore, and her mom lives in Singapore, so during breaks we’re on a twelve hour time difference. That means most of the time when I’m up, she’s asleep, and when she’s up, I’m asleep. This leaves me with a lot of time thinking about her but not being able to talk to her. So instead I leave little messages and such for her to wake up to, like this gem:  It all started with the Beyonce skydiving p 

I do not know whether the photograph below is what you would call the “cutest” one of my wife Leony and myself, but it is the one that is perhaps the dearest to me. I always carry it around in my wallet, which explains why it is in such a somewhat worn state. It was taken on our second date exactly 23 years ago today, on 6th January 1995, after we had met for the first time only a few days earlier. As you can see we are feeding the pigeons in Trafalgar Square, London.  At the time Leony was working for her Chinese employer in Hong Kong but visiting London with the employer, and so after being pe 

Unlike many couples, we don't have many photos of ours as we meet very rarely in our long distance relationship. Also, when we meet we become so busy in conversations that every time we forget to click a photo. we are not photo-maniac. We both are so simple &amp; unromantic, yes people like me do exist. She was my classmate and we did our schooling together. I had a crush on her but you will be surprised, we never talked even once to each other during our school time because we both were so shy, studious, introverts and over matured. :P She was always the topper of our class and even topped our dist 

Remember how I met a guy on Instagram from my hometown in the U.S. while I was living in Thailand? And how he flew 9,000 miles and met me in Thailand and we spent 8 glorious days together on a 5 star resort on Phi Phi Island together and fell in love? We're still together. It’s been 3 months! The problem with our photos from that trip is I got a weird skin reaction on my face. I left that out of our love story. My chin got kind of scabbed and I didn't like a single photo we took because my face was red and gross! (Can you believe he still liked me??) Hence, the photos I shared were mostly far a 

My wife and I love to travel and have a bunch of photos together. Here are couple of photos that I like the most. Finland.. Out of all the photos we took in Finland with Huskies, Rein Deers and not to forget with Santa, I somehow love our random selfie we took just outside of ReinDeer Farm in Rovaniemi, Finland.  I have no clue why she was so excited!! Goa.. Our last trip to India was a memorable one and she just loved the mini photo session in Goa done by my Brother. Finally we were not bothering any random tourists to click our photos.  Amsterdam.. This is one of my favourite pic from Amsterdam.  Shoul 

What are some secret things that women will never tell men?
Here are some things that i wanna tell these guys. If we find you really attractive then we might be checking you out in the dirtiest of ways, but we'll turn away the moment you look back.Yes, we stare at you because we want to talk to you and we'll keep staring at you until it becomes obvious. But, its you who have to start the conversation.Sometimes, its not your fault at all. We just get upset and over react to spice up things! So, be smart enough to judge the situation.WE LOVE SURPRISES. But if you don't wanna get yourself killed then make sure you don't even give us a slight hint of the su

Some people say that a woman's mind is like a needle in the sea, and she always seems unable to understand it. But in fact, people who really understand women deeply understand that women want very little, nothing more than a beloved, supporting each other until they grow old. But how to identify this intimate lover, women often interact with the opposite sex, they will not tell these four secrets to men, because this is the weakness of women, once men know how to do, often women will love you as destiny.  Love psychology 1. Women will secretly look at men's things In love and communication, most w 

 We notice everything about someone who has piqued our interest. And I mean EVERYTHING. Ahem!We don’t have it easy in the world of love and relationships either. Even we have bruised hearts.The ‘natural look’ that many girls have on their faces is the result of a careful make-up session to cover up any blotches or imperfections. No, a majority of us don’t ‘naturally’ have skin that looks like a porcelain doll’s face. We have to work for it.We enjoy getting attention as long as it does not cross the line. Beyond the line lie the perverts and oglers. Please don’t go there!Pour a spoonful of warm 

Here I am sharing 21 secret that women will never tell men. I got them from my experience dealing with them &amp; from the internet and Quora to keep them at one place.1- They hate it when you show off about how many girls are behind you. 2- Girls are jealous creatures. Don’t talk about your exes 3- Girls love it when you tell your friends/ parents about them.4- They notice your behavior with watchman/ drivers/ waiters, how you talk with people on calls; they stalk your social media and check your comments. 5- They check out men and yes, they have a long list of crushes.6- They love surprise 

We fart-. Wow what a surprise ! We are humans too! This may really come as surprise for you: It's harder for us to control our farts than it is for you due to weaker muscles in the areas in relevance. We stink …but we are smarter not to show it. When pregnant we simply turn into farting machine. We do like sex - and a lot! We simply don't have those crazy levels of testosterone you men have that make you have that 'push' to rape. We may like sex even more than you but don't have that push and urge . Your deodorants are so fucking sexy. We can nearly smell you testosterone dripping out of it! I swear  

We love long foreplay and cuddling. In short, we love before and aftermath of sex, more than sex itself.Guys can never compete with us in checking out 'girls'. You heard me right, we do check out more than you, from bangs on hair, nail polish color and design to toe rings, we scan in seconds, much faster than you.We don't check out guys more often. We talk about their abs only in front of you to trigger jealousy in you.We crave for unexpected hugs and stolen kisses.As much as we fight for equality, we desire you take the first lead in romance, but with mutual consent.We love sex as much as you

Why would we let our secrets out ? :P Okay here are few - Unlike your bro code, and how even unknown guys are your bros, girls are different. Although we will gladly help a stranger girl, only our best friends are our sisters.Even we discuss about boys and sex and other things, just like men do, but in a more civilized manner. And then we act like we don't in front of guys.That we will give a sanitary pad even to a stranger girl on road if she asks for one. No girl will say no. Trust me in this.We check out each other's clothes to check they're not spoiled.We cover for each other in front of our

There are countless things. They won’t tell men that they’re high maintenance &amp; that they secretly wish to be spoilt rotten &amp; pampered, more so, than they’d even be able to repay their partner. Women will never tell men, that they’re incredibly jealous of his beautiful ex, even if they throw a jealousy fit in his presence. They’ll display their jealousy, but most likely, never to the fullest extent, bec if they did, they know they may well lose their partner. They either learn to live with this jealousy &amp; accept it, or else, they find another guy &amp; repeat the cycle all over again, never really und

Secrets Women Wish You Knew A Caring Guy Is a Hot Guy What do women want? For those who've ever pondered this question, here are 19 relationship secrets. They're based on the study of healthy, happy couples and our changing gender roles. Secret No. 1: Women appreciate a guy with a sensitive side, especially when they're upset.

Have you ever met someone who you literally could not take your eyes off of?
What happened in that moment when you realized you are in love with your significant other?
What happened in that moment when you realized you are in love with your significant other?
I was friends with my boyfriend for a year before we got together. We talked every day. We went out together. We laughed together. I loved him - as a friend. Four days after we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend, exactly one month ago, I had a date night planned with him, but his roommate got sick, and we had to cancel. I was in the middle of moving into my flat, and had no furniture, food, or stuff to do. He stopped by at lunch time with pizza, flowers, strawberries, and ice cream. We ate, using a moving box as a table. We cuddled on a blanket on the floor. He told me I was beautiful, cal 

When I realized that I was in too deep. We started dating during my senior year and his first year of college after knowing each for three years. I had been single for a long time with the intention that I was not going to continue dating just to prove that I was worthy of having a boyfriend. Sure, dating happened, but the other parties knew that they would not become my significant other. He wanted a relationship with me and was forward about it, clearly stating his intentions. That got my respect and I told him that we could explore our options and if a foundation existed for trust and respect 

I had just gotten back from being away from home for about 10 months. My ex, who I lived with during that time in New Orleans, Louisiana I had caught cheating and needless to say I was in pretty rough shape. I was very confused, very hurt, and so very tired from being up for 48 hours. Thankfully the drive back home gave me much needed time to think and process what had happened but the one thing that I kept coming back to was being excited to be going back home. Despite being in that state my thoughts always strayed back to my best friend and I couldn’t contain the feeling of being absolutely e 

If you were to die tomorrow, I would treasure these two amazing dates we’ve shared. And, if you were to die in a month, I would have had a month to get to know you. And, if you were to die in six months, I would have had the chance to fall in love with you. Anything after that is icing on the cake. Those were the words she used to tell me that she was comfortable dating a man with late-stage cancer. Here we are. This photo sits in a frame at the top of the stairs to our second-floor living room, in our home.  In May of last year, I was in dating mode. I had a profile on a few dating apps, and I ha 

I've known my boyfriend since I was twelve years old. We were friends for a year or two, then we started to be friends who held hands, and then friends who kissed, and as we got older our relationship just kept changing. We still talked about history, watched Hank Green videos together, and fought over the proper way to solve social justice issues, but we physically started to be closer. We never dated, but we knew we were friends who also had feelings for each other that weren't platonic. We blamed it on teenage hormones for a long time. Sometimes we would stop doing our friends with benefits 

I had known my husband for 6 years before he finally asked me out. There was an opportunity where we were both single and finally set our sights on each other. I had gotten my wisdom teeth surgically removed the morning after our first date. I developed serious dry socket infections in all four gaping wounds in my mouth where the teeth were dug out. It was the most painful and horrible experience of my life up to this point. Childbirth didn’t even come close. My mom was looking after me in the days following my surgery. I couldn’t function from the pain, couldn’t get out of bed, and I kept throw 

The first time I saw her…well, our eyes didn’t meet, I was straining to catch some more subtle elements. Her thick wavy hair won’t permit, they sheathed most of her face. Some days later, our eyes met. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I was transfixed for a little longer than normal. She claims to have no memory of it though. The day I heard that coy girl speak for the first time, I loved it. That was the day I took up that botched up mission of asking for her notes, ended up asking her equally pretty friend. I quickly transformed from an insignificant-nobody to a buffoon, that wasn’t funny at al 

Ours was a complete arrange marriage. During our 10 months of courtship (a long distance one) though we got along well but I was not entirely happy with the course of our relationship. It was not anything even an inch similar to what it is shown in movies or I have seen happening with my cousins and friends, where the two people either since day 1 or sometimes later are in head over heels love with each other. I even confronted him regarding my insecurity to which his reply always remained the same, he constantly made me understand that we are living apart and contacting over texts/phones so th 

When i realized i actually wanted to do things with him, when i was willing to put in effort. Before my current boyfriend and i began seeing each other in December’s 2018, I was having a rough year. Had just graduated high school, had spent 10 months of that year in an unhappy relationship where i was abused, undermined, and ignored. I finally told my ex to hit the road when our 3 year anniversary had rolled around and I was drunk 3 hours away from his university. It was a difficult breakup. He stalked me for months after. Sending me pictures of his self mutilation, walking all over his city at  

I missed her. We were friends for years, having met in church. I always got the feeling that she liked me, but she drove me crazy. We kind of drove each other crazy, actually. We were asked to lead church events together, because we were good at it, but that often led to fights because she had trouble seeing how often I had the correct perspective on things… :-) She was about as different from me as anyone could be, so if there were two ways to do something, guaranteed we each chose a different way. We had lots of fun dates over the years with our other friends, just casual stuff. Game nights, di 

What is the cutest photo of you and your significant other?
Now here’s the real problem in posting one picture of one significant person. There are many people who puts up significance in your life and are needed to be highlighted !! Like way if I just start with, the first person in my mind is 1. My Dad &lt;3 Having him is the real blessing for me. He’s surely the coolest dad in town. We both can discuss almost anything together, hang-out togther and share drinks together. He always puts up trust in me which make me more connected to him.  “We both love beer” 2. My MOM &lt;3 She puts up equal significance in my life. The most prettiest woman I have ever seen. ( I ser 

The way I look at her. Love. Fondness. Awestruck. Admiration.  And the way she looks at me. Seriously, Tapesh. WTF.  Dancing to the tunes at our first DJ night. Things I learnt that night… She is an amazing dancer.Tappu can't dance salla. A long solitary stroll in the lap of Himalayas. I still remember each and every word of the conversation we had.  Enjoying the ice-cold water on our feet at Kullu. She loves swimming and playing in the water. I have a phobia of large water bodies. But when we are together, I'd forget even a gunshot to the heart.  A memorable evening tea in the forests of Dalhousie. I talked, a 

My husband and I are what I like to call a “hybrid family”. He's Polish-American and I am Bangladeshi-American. Our backgrounds could not be any more different, yet we are two peas in a pod. He's my number one support system and my best friend. Here's a couple of pictures of us throughout the years.  Here's him proposing to me at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC.  In the Polish culture, the bride does a bridal dance. Everyone pays to dance with her, and at the end, the groom has to pay his price and everyone tries to stop him from “stealing the bride away”. That's my dad trying to stop him from 

Saw some really amazing photos of couples and it felt so good to see people happy in love. Let me share some of mine :) We bonded over food. On our first date, I gulped down almost an entire plate of Biryani, leaving him almost nothing. Ever since we have been food companions exploring out different places in Bangalore. This one is from Permit Room (South Indian Food in Western Style)  We usually ended up being colour coded quite often even when we weren’t trying. Here’s two of them:   Then, there’s me wearing his new t-shirt before he could even touch it  Here’s me trying to photobomb his selfie.  This  

My girlfriend doesn't have social media (smart woman!), so I thought I'd share this for her. This was on the 4th of July. I met her in college, and we didn't even know each other until the 2017 spring semester concluded. I'm excited to go back this fall with this lady. Her heart is about as golden and genuine as her smile. Her name is McKenna. (I guess when you're both photographers, you get some pretty cute photos together) EDIT: I gave the bottom photo to her as a gift last weekend, and this was her reaction. I'm absolutely in love with this woman. Taken on our 2nd date - July 4th, 2017  Taken on 

My girlfriend and I attend the same university, which means we have the luxury of spending lots of time together. But when we’re on breaks from school, connecting can be a bit harder. My parents live in Baltimore, and her mom lives in Singapore, so during breaks we’re on a twelve hour time difference. That means most of the time when I’m up, she’s asleep, and when she’s up, I’m asleep. This leaves me with a lot of time thinking about her but not being able to talk to her. So instead I leave little messages and such for her to wake up to, like this gem:  It all started with the Beyonce skydiving p 

I do not know whether the photograph below is what you would call the “cutest” one of my wife Leony and myself, but it is the one that is perhaps the dearest to me. I always carry it around in my wallet, which explains why it is in such a somewhat worn state. It was taken on our second date exactly 23 years ago today, on 6th January 1995, after we had met for the first time only a few days earlier. As you can see we are feeding the pigeons in Trafalgar Square, London.  At the time Leony was working for her Chinese employer in Hong Kong but visiting London with the employer, and so after being pe 

Unlike many couples, we don't have many photos of ours as we meet very rarely in our long distance relationship. Also, when we meet we become so busy in conversations that every time we forget to click a photo. we are not photo-maniac. We both are so simple &amp; unromantic, yes people like me do exist. She was my classmate and we did our schooling together. I had a crush on her but you will be surprised, we never talked even once to each other during our school time because we both were so shy, studious, introverts and over matured. :P She was always the topper of our class and even topped our dist 

Remember how I met a guy on Instagram from my hometown in the U.S. while I was living in Thailand? And how he flew 9,000 miles and met me in Thailand and we spent 8 glorious days together on a 5 star resort on Phi Phi Island together and fell in love? We're still together. It’s been 3 months! The problem with our photos from that trip is I got a weird skin reaction on my face. I left that out of our love story. My chin got kind of scabbed and I didn't like a single photo we took because my face was red and gross! (Can you believe he still liked me??) Hence, the photos I shared were mostly far a 

My wife and I love to travel and have a bunch of photos together. Here are couple of photos that I like the most. Finland.. Out of all the photos we took in Finland with Huskies, Rein Deers and not to forget with Santa, I somehow love our random selfie we took just outside of ReinDeer Farm in Rovaniemi, Finland.  I have no clue why she was so excited!! Goa.. Our last trip to India was a memorable one and she just loved the mini photo session in Goa done by my Brother. Finally we were not bothering any random tourists to click our photos.  Amsterdam.. This is one of my favourite pic from Amsterdam.  Shoul 

What are some secret things that women will never tell men?
Here are some things that i wanna tell these guys. If we find you really attractive then we might be checking you out in the dirtiest of ways, but we'll turn away the moment you look back.Yes, we stare at you because we want to talk to you and we'll keep staring at you until it becomes obvious. But, its you who have to start the conversation.Sometimes, its not your fault at all. We just get upset and over react to spice up things! So, be smart enough to judge the situation.WE LOVE SURPRISES. But if you don't wanna get yourself killed then make sure you don't even give us a slight hint of the su

Some people say that a woman's mind is like a needle in the sea, and she always seems unable to understand it. But in fact, people who really understand women deeply understand that women want very little, nothing more than a beloved, supporting each other until they grow old. But how to identify this intimate lover, women often interact with the opposite sex, they will not tell these four secrets to men, because this is the weakness of women, once men know how to do, often women will love you as destiny.  Love psychology 1. Women will secretly look at men's things In love and communication, most w 

 We notice everything about someone who has piqued our interest. And I mean EVERYTHING. Ahem!We don’t have it easy in the world of love and relationships either. Even we have bruised hearts.The ‘natural look’ that many girls have on their faces is the result of a careful make-up session to cover up any blotches or imperfections. No, a majority of us don’t ‘naturally’ have skin that looks like a porcelain doll’s face. We have to work for it.We enjoy getting attention as long as it does not cross the line. Beyond the line lie the perverts and oglers. Please don’t go there!Pour a spoonful of warm 

Here I am sharing 21 secret that women will never tell men. I got them from my experience dealing with them &amp; from the internet and Quora to keep them at one place.1- They hate it when you show off about how many girls are behind you. 2- Girls are jealous creatures. Don’t talk about your exes 3- Girls love it when you tell your friends/ parents about them.4- They notice your behavior with watchman/ drivers/ waiters, how you talk with people on calls; they stalk your social media and check your comments. 5- They check out men and yes, they have a long list of crushes.6- They love surprise 

We fart-. Wow what a surprise ! We are humans too! This may really come as surprise for you: It's harder for us to control our farts than it is for you due to weaker muscles in the areas in relevance. We stink …but we are smarter not to show it. When pregnant we simply turn into farting machine. We do like sex - and a lot! We simply don't have those crazy levels of testosterone you men have that make you have that 'push' to rape. We may like sex even more than you but don't have that push and urge . Your deodorants are so fucking sexy. We can nearly smell you testosterone dripping out of it! I swear  

We love long foreplay and cuddling. In short, we love before and aftermath of sex, more than sex itself.Guys can never compete with us in checking out 'girls'. You heard me right, we do check out more than you, from bangs on hair, nail polish color and design to toe rings, we scan in seconds, much faster than you.We don't check out guys more often. We talk about their abs only in front of you to trigger jealousy in you.We crave for unexpected hugs and stolen kisses.As much as we fight for equality, we desire you take the first lead in romance, but with mutual consent.We love sex as much as you

What was the most hurtful thing your partner said or did to you?
This is long so bear with me. Prior to this incident, I was in a long-term relationship with I believed would be my future husband. We were together for 7 years. We had our ups and downs, but we got through it all. That is until his situation is life changed, courtesy of his new job and with better prospects on the horizon, 7 years meant nothing. With that relationship, I tried my hardest to work things out. He asked for space, I have it to him. He asked for time to concentrate on work, I did that too. I tried to be as accommodating as I could to make his life easier and still he left. I was a me 

Such a question always worries me in that it's dwelling in the past…. History! I'm speaking to you out of love, because it concerns me to see you doing EXACTLY what I did, and at the time the situation was so overwhelming that I couldn't see what was happening, why it was happening, or how to get out of it. So I'm just saying…I was there as well, and so long as you don't forgive that person it's you who will remain caught in the trap of anger, hurt, pain, bitterness, recriminatoon, and the root cause is unforgiveness that entered through offense.. and it will make a victim out of you. . I read som 

This so difficult to write without crying but I'm going to do it anyway. My husband and I had a great 14 years of marriage until September of 2018. He told me a girl at work was flirting with him and he likes her a lot. He said she has a boyfriend but he thinks she still likes him a lot. She is 25 years old and he is 36 years old. He said she is smart and beautiful. He wants to be with someone who is intelligent and funny. He said I'm too serious, and my body is not perfect. I was born with scoliosis and he knew that before he married me. I can't conceive a child due to my back problem. He said he  

Being lied. And every time we have an argument, he always hurt me emotionally and phiysically. Let me name him “Mr. Y.” I met him a year ago. We are both broke that time. We both understand each other feelings because we are being left by our partners. I admit that we met each other in improper way. We got to know each in our own convenience. We found each others comfort through telling the stories of our exes. Knowing his story, I admired his personality. He was kind and true to his feelings. And I really fought my feelings not to be attracted because little did I know that I have my scattered 

What was the most hurtful thing your partner said or did to you? This story really doesn’t compare in scope to what most of the other respondents are putting in their answers. My wife and I met in college and became friends. After a while, we developed a mutual interest in going beyond platonic friendship. When we became romantically involved it was the summer before my senior year. We spent a great first year together. Over the course of that time, any time she wasn’t feeling well, I always got her mashed potatoes (usually fast food) and a small LEGO set, as we were both big LEGO fans. I had alwa 

I went to bed one night with what I thought was my best friend and love of my life. We had been together in a relationship for a year and everything was amazing in my eyes, she held me all night and made love to me when I woke up for work in the morning. She wouldn't go in for a couple hours after me, kissed me and sent me on my way to work. I came home to see she was gone, no reasoning, only a short letter saying she was fighting battles within her self and she's sorry that this wasn't mutual and that she loved me, she just needed time so I let her go. She still comes in and out of my life ev 

He blamed our problems on my depression. We weren't together long, about 4 months. This was before I met my husband and it taught me a lot about relationships. He lived about 3 hours away but we had a lot of weekends together. It's a long story but I'll try to condense it. So he would keep doing things that got to me. I thought to begin with that I would let it happen, get used to it, but one of them started causing me physical pain. When I asked him to stop, he switched to something else which caused just as much pain. I will be straight here - this was not physical abuse, I was not hit. It was m 

“I’m not in love with you anymore.” I’m going to try to write this since its still relatively fresh. We had been together for almost a year and a half. Pure bliss, happiness and without a doubt the one person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I proposed and the world took on a new light. We made wedding plans and took pictures with her new ring, and loved introducing each other as “fiancé”. We called each other husband and wife because for all we cared we were together forever. Then some things changed. We moved into a new place with a roommate. We had both had issues with losing our j 

This is so painful still, after all these years, that I started to pass on this question. But I’m going to share anyway. I want other women who are in the same situation I was at the time.. not working outside the home to raise children, to be aware. I’m not saying others have bad marriages or are married to a louse like I was. What I’m saying is to be prepared with a support system, and/or your own funds. My ex and I had been married about 8 years when he got a job transfer to another state. We were both excited, but it meant leaving my family and moving to a state where his family were. I was 

“ You’ve definitely cheated on me, at least ten different times, probably with ten different dudes, while you were pregnant (with our child).” I will never forget this as long as I live. My biggest regret is not paying attention to those red flags that were definitely there. Disgusting things, like examining my clothing for “cum stains” and taking pics to accuse me later. Or getting up and taking off in the middle of being intimate (called his ex to pick him up this time) because he suddenly believed he saw evidence that I had just had sex with someone else. I regret not leaving then. I was ce

I was in the middle of moving into my flat, and had no furniture, food, or stuff to do. He stopped by at lunch time with pizza, flowers, strawberries, and ice cream. We ate, using a moving box as a table. We cuddled on a blanket on the floor. He told me I was beautiful, cal 

When I realized that I was in too deep. We started dating during my senior year and his first year of college after knowing each for three years. I had been single for a long time with the intention that I was not going to continue dating just to prove that I was worthy of having a boyfriend. Sure, dating happened, but the other parties knew that they would not become my significant other. He wanted a relationship with me and was forward about it, clearly stating his intentions. That got my respect and I told him that we could explore our options and if a foundation existed for trust and respect 

I had just gotten back from being away from home for about 10 months. My ex, who I lived with during that time in New Orleans, Louisiana I had caught cheating and needless to say I was in pretty rough shape. I was very confused, very hurt, and so very tired from being up for 48 hours. Thankfully the drive back home gave me much needed time to think and process what had happened but the one thing that I kept coming back to was being excited to be going back home. Despite being in that state my thoughts always strayed back to my best friend and I couldn’t contain the feeling of being absolutely e 

If you were to die tomorrow, I would treasure these two amazing dates we’ve shared. And, if you were to die in a month, I would have had a month to get to know you. And, if you were to die in six months, I would have had the chance to fall in love with you. Anything after that is icing on the cake. Those were the words she used to tell me that she was comfortable dating a man with late-stage cancer. Here we are.

I've known my boyfriend since I was twelve years old. We were friends for a year or two, then we started to be friends who held hands, and then friends who kissed, and as we got older our relationship just kept changing. We still talked about history, watched Hank Green videos together, and fought over the proper way to solve social justice issues, but we physically started to be closer. We never dated, but we knew we were friends who also had feelings for each other that weren't platonic. We blamed it on teenage hormones for a long time. Sometimes we would stop doing our friends with benefits 

I had known my husband for 6 years before he finally asked me out. There was an opportunity where we were both single and finally set our sights on each other. I had gotten my wisdom teeth surgically removed the morning after our first date. I developed serious dry socket infections in all four gaping wounds in my mouth where the teeth were dug out. It was the most painful and horrible experience of my life up to this point. Childbirth didn’t even come close. My mom was looking after me in the days following my surgery. I couldn’t function from the pain, couldn’t get out of bed, and I kept throw 

The first time I saw her…well, our eyes didn’t meet, I was straining to catch some more subtle elements. Her thick wavy hair won’t permit, they sheathed most of her face. Some days later, our eyes met. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I was transfixed for a little longer than normal. She claims to have no memory of it though. The day I heard that coy girl speak for the first time, I loved it. That was the day I took up that botched up mission of asking for her notes, ended up asking her equally pretty friend.

Ours was a complete arrange marriage. During our 10 months of courtship (a long distance one) though we got along well but I was not entirely happy with the course of our relationship.

I missed her. We were friends for years, having met in church. I always got the feeling that she liked me, but she drove me crazy. We kind of drove each other crazy, actually. We were asked to lead church events together, because we were good at it, but that often led to fights because she had trouble seeing how often I had the correct perspective on things… :-) She was about as different from me as anyone could be, so if there were two ways to do something, guaranteed we each chose a different way.

Can you really find love again after you broke up with someone who you thought was “the one”?
How can I tell if my girlfriend really loves me?
Girls can be quite expressive and obvious. When a woman loves you, she will dive into your world and make you her world. She will try to know everything about your world, mix up in your world. Your family will interest her more than her own family.She will take efforts for you, she will do lots of stuff for you. She will make you feel special. She will try to know what bothers you and cover up for it. She will try and understand you more, your preferences and tastes, and surprise you more often than that.She would care for you and advise you like you are her baby. Well, it's inherently there in

Actions and emotions are always in tune. If a girl truly loves you, her actions will be in tune with it. Never judge a girl by her words, the truth always lies in her actions. Most guys find girls confusing because girls usually don’t follow up on what they seem to be saying. The thumb rule to follow with girls is to base your judgments on their actions, rather than their words. Just because a girl tells you that she loves you, does not mean that she really feels love for you deep down. Girls are usually not very decided about what they want so they just follow their intuition unconsciously. That 

You don't.  Even though texting is now a huge part of how we convey information with each other, it misses out on a very crucial part of human communication: body language or nonverbal communication.   When we talk to one another in person, the majority of the way we communicate does not involve words!  With an emotion like love, how your girlfriend interacts with you in a physical space is a much more important indicator of how she feels about you than what she says in text messages.  She might say, "I love you SOOO much! &lt;3 &lt;3" in a text message, but when you're together, for example, she mai 

I think the question here is why are you questioning that she does? Is is because you’re hearing warning bells about her behaviour or is it because you really can’t see why she loves you? If its the first, one of the hardest lessons I learned and one of the wisest is, if you hear warning bells, listen to them, as long as they are genuine warning bells and not bells of your own making. Humans have a remarkable ability to self sabotage, due to our own lack of belief in ourselves and sometimes we can start reading signs and portents into things because we’re so afraid of losing someone and we end u 

Thanks for such a lovely A2A. Well, I think here are some of the points. If she is walking with you, suddenly she holds your hand tightly after seeing a gang of boys. Yes, she loves you.If she acts with complete maturity in front of others but behaves like a two year old, in front of you, yes she loves you.If your, just a Hi message sets a big smile on her face, and she puts her hair flick beside her ear. Yes, she loves you.If she really cares more for you and your family, aww, she loves you.If she says that she wants a junior you in the future, yes she loves you.If she is jealous and angry when

There various ways to know if your girlfriend loves you or not... 1. If your girlfriend loves you, she will be anxious to please you.2. If she loves you, she will be eager to see you all the time.3. If your girlfriend loves you, she will not expect you to be the only one who calls her more frequently. If your girlfriend hardly call you with the excuse that she doesn't have call credit all the time, then re-evaluate your relationship again!4. If she loves you, she will trust you unconditionally - even when she sees you in the company of other girls. She will not just jump to hasty conclusions 

Well this is interesting. Just understand this, if she really loves you, the first thing is that you will start doubting yourself whether you deserve her or not. And besides “ I love you”, she'll do things unconditionally. If you are really confused, you can look for signs. Tell her you're down with fever and you will find that the only person who is as worried as your mom and sister is your girl. Those hourly calls asking how you feel, have you eaten something, say it all.Tell her to wake you up at an odd hour. Let's say 4am. Trust me, it doesn't matter when she sleeps. She will get up at 3:30

Women are unpredictable beings. They are emotional and they change their minds easily. They can be impulsive and surprising. They can easily fall in love, and later on have a change of heart. This is one of the causes of men’s heartbreaks. However, when a woman matures and experiences true love, she can be so selfless that she becomes so vulnerable. She would not let emotions sway her from side to side. She will be faithful to you. 1. She takes care of you like a mom. You would know how much your girlfriend loves you based on how she takes care of you. Her mother instinct makes her do everythin 

I’d been someone’s girlfriend for 4 years, so I think I can answer this question based on my experience in a serious relationship. You’ll know if your girlfriend really loves you when: She cares for you more than you would even care for yourself; she’ll even encourage you to take supplements and share with you her own vitamins/supplements that she thinks are really good for the health.She can’t wait to tell you stories about her day; she will text/chat you throughout the day even if you don’t reply right away. (Girls are better multi-taskers than boys; it’s a fact)She’ll ask you how’s your day, 

Oh my; this is a question I struggle with myself. We all want to be loved the way we want to be loved. And all of us have different love languages, and different styles and different measurements. So; I can get right down and tell you that it's how she makes you feel loved. But that's not accurate enough because sometimes you can't just base your answer on how you "feel" loved (maybe you cannot "see" or comprehend the level of love she has for you). Since different people show love in their own unique way; let's explore further. I suggest you to take a pen and paper and sit yourself down and try y 

Dating and Relationships: 
Any relationship cannot be told as a perfect relationship just by a single word or a key as said .After all there is nothing called as a perfect relationship because, humans are not created to be perfect by god and we all have flaws.The least anyone can do in any relationship is put efforts and try to make a meaningful relationship So coming to the point that what is key for strong relationship? There are many factors for a relationship to be strong and from my opinion i will be listing a few . 1)Accepting the Person as who they are and as they are : This is the most important factor in any relat 

1. Date Them Like They’re New To You  In the beginning of a relationship, you are on your best behaviour and put in a lot of effort.  Then you feel like you’ve won them and you stop trying as hard.If you date them like they’re new to you at all stages of the relationship, it not only makes them feel more appreciated, it also makes you more attracted to them.  Our minds have this cool little mechanism around commitment and consistency (and if you’ve ever studied sales psychology then you’ve likely heard of this little trick).  Basically it states that whatever we do, our mind forces us to believ 

It depends on how you define “successful”. Oftentimes you can make a relationship endure (“successfully”) by always subordinating your needs and desires to someone else. In that case the relationship is almost a “master-slave” relationship or “sadistic-masochistic” relationship. If you have no spine, if you always do what the other person wants, if you always submit to their whim then it’s possible they will hang around because it’s great to have a lackey, but that won’t guarantee happiness for either party. In real life, enduring is not the same as success when it comes to relationships. Succe 

Transparency: The ability of staying brutally honest is really very important. It eliminates the risk of being insecure about the relationship.TRUST: Probably the single most important aspect of a relationship is trust.Developing trust takes it's own sweet time,but once it is there there is not looking back. Being able to trust your partners instinct is a very crucial element.Being open to Critisism: Taking your partner's word seriously really shows how serious you're in a relationship. Sometimes the critisism can really affect your self esteem or ego, but taking things in positive way really 

I spent a lot of time as a young man trying to understand relationships. It was a learning process. I learnt somethings and I still learn.It took me years. Hope this helps you I am blessed to share 1. Be Honest with yourself first and know yourself : Why do you need the relationship?  whats your goal for the relationship is it companionship or sex or partnership or sharing love? why do you want to commit? what are your intentions and motivations? Why did your last relationship fail? Are you using relationship to curb your loneliness or medicate your feelings? Work on your issues they are yours 

You can have a fairly successful relationship by doing the following 1. Find your partners love language and use it The five love languages are: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. Make sure you find out what your partners love language is so that you can love them in the way that means the most to them. I often find myself guilty of buying my partner gifts to show my love (because receiving gifts is my love language) and then being shocked when they tell me they don’t feel loved. Every person is different and every person shows and receives  

If you figure this out, be sure to tell me. I still am learning. When Rick and I first started dating, I had all the power. He's a lot younger than me, but neither of us had ever been in a long term relationship. As an avid watcher of many failed and successful relationships, I had seen enough to know some really powerful "do's and don't's", but otherwise I was winging it. Some things that I learned over time: Never manipulate emotions. After a year together, I started to become manipulative. I'd simmer in anger (or what I believed was anger) because it just destroyed him to have me shut him out

Always listen to your partnerWhether they are telling you about their day, a story from their childhood, or expressing a need, you need to listen to them. Everyone needs someone to vent to, get advice from, and share their life with. If you can’t listen, then you won’t have a stable relationship.Say I love you regurlarlyObviously this only counts after you have said I love you, but once you do, make sure to say it often. Too many people stop saying this because they assume the other person knows how they feel and doesn’t need to hear it. But imagine how you would feel if during you entire chil

SEVEN WAYS TO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP 1. UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF RELATIONSHIP: Many single christians are entering into relationships, which in reality they should have never begun because they were unaware of what having a Godly relationship involves. The Bible says: "And the Lord gives thee understanding in all things 2Tim 2:7" a solid foundation can only come when a true understanding of the meaning of relationship from its basis. With such an understanding, a relationship not only becomes more meaningful, it is also more likely to last because it is built on Godly wisdom, principles and  

Trust Trust is the most essential ingredient in a relationship, and if it isn’t present anymore, the relationship bleeds internally, either knowingly or unbeknownst to both or either people. Communication Communication is a—or the—cornerstone to relationships, and is probably the most essential skill for both people to develop. It is impossible to have both a healthy relationship and at the same time have no clue how to talk gently, kindly, confidently and/or understandingly, without judgment or criticism, to your partner. If you are deeply focused on and attentive to your partner’s inner world, th 

How can one be completely in love with me and then cut me off like I’m nothing?
There are so many reasons. You must be in a great deal of pain to ask this question so I’m going to be gentle with you. Here are some possibilities of what has happened. They initially liked the you that you presented to them and put you on a pedestal. They liked the fantasized version of you but when you didn’t live up to their perfect expectations, they cut you off. They will likely do this again with their next relationship. Option 2 - they initially genuinely liked you but you hurt them (unintentionally). They were too fearful to bring up the issues with you /were afraid of conflict and so c 

As someone who’s had this happen to them very recently, I deeply feel for you. My ex and I had a magical time, and I still do not doubt the authenticity of her feelings, but then she suddenly cut me off. To be fair, she did send me a few long text messages trying to explain her situation, and that clarified things somewhat, which I’ll get to below. But first of all, it’s very natural and understandable to seek comfort in an explanation. And while a good explanation could soothe your nerves a little, the truth that is being abandoned is always painful one way or another. Secondly, as others have  

Right now run out and get a book called “Uncoupling” by Diane Vaughan. In that book, she lays out the stages (with examples) of how intimate relationships come apart. Looking back on my past breakups, I can see some of those stages in *every* one of my relationships. However, I’ll give you some possible scenarios for why your former partner seems to have moved on and isn’t looking back: Your former partner already has something else going and has moved on. This is a big theme in Vaughan’s book. With fairly long-term relationships, it takes a lot of planning to end it, and the initiator, as Vaug

still real-ling myself from just a week ago. Goes like this. After two years she comes back. Out the gate, we are friends again… we worked out our problems over lunch, and she gave me a smile that said, “we are good.” There were sparks, and well, one night watching a movie in her bed, she snuggled up… and put my arm around her and said, “ Welcome back love.” …and we pretty much didn’t watch the rest of the movie! Time went on, and I was with her for a whole month every day… we reconnected strongly. We were making plans of moving out together. SHE, was from Tennessee. And missed home. I said we 

Simmy did a wonderful job outlining various possibilities, so I’m just going to add one thing for you to think about. Perhaps you are asking the right question, but in a slightly different form, it might yield more positive insight: “Was what this person felt for me really ‘love’ as I would define it?” Simmy gave great answers on this topic, and I just want to add a little to that. There are basically two types of personalities (using a VERY big generalization): those who take and those who give. We all fill these roles at one time or another, but most of us have a preferred method of relating t 

Here's an honest answer from someone who cuts others off even if I love them. Most likely, it felt like a blunt cut off to you.but you had it coming for sometime and your person got fed up. Here are some reasons I cut off people off and keep moving with my life. They: disregard or minimize my feelings consistentlyTake me for granted or treat me as an optionDisrespect me through name calling, emotional or physical abuseUnwilling to communicate or views my bringing up an issue for discussion as naggingCheat, lie, or falsely misrepresent himselfRarely give me QUALITY TIME…only here and there strin

Because they don’t want anymore emotional pain, they don’t want anymore promises, they don’t want to wait anymore for the person to get it and see what they got, they don’t want to wait for the person to give them what they want and it has been with-held for too long, they had enough of the boring talk, the impatience, the attention seeking….and…the doubts, the uncertainty they felt and lack of trust they felt the other person felt. No use being with someone who doesn’t trust you. No use being with someone selfish and who does not give back. No use being with someone who doesn’t respect your boun 

I am a wrong person to comment but I did something same to my loving boyfriend. He is the best person I could ever have. He always cared for me like a baby. He was a home person and always used to invite me over and order lunch. We used to make coffee together. He showed so much affection and love that sometimes I used to get confuse what did I do to have him. He never hide his phone. Then you must be thinking what could have happened that I left him all of sudden. Just on one text. Okay so despite of birth control, I got pregnant one day. God knows how. He owned his baby. I ama student and the 

If you pay attention to what is recommended by the most people, to those who are trying to move on from a failed relationship, you will discover that the NUMBER ONE MOST RECOMMENDED STRATEGY is to completely cut the other person out of your life in every way, cold turkey. That will APPEAR to be going from ”love you deeply” to “don’t give a damn about you.” In reality, it’s usually true that the person who has thus cut you off, is suffering plenty of emotional pain, but they know that they HAVE TO keep you away, in order to recover and carry on their lives. Yes, sometimes people just plain lie. Bu 

We loved each other a lot, but things didn’t work out, I wasn’t ready to marry as i myself was dependent on my family and had a low paying job. She couldn’t delay marriage as her mother had decided to marry her at any cost. She got a better guy than me, I felt she shouldn’t be settling for a average guy like me.I didn’t had a house of my own. She wanted someone who at least has his own house. Why not, after all she deserved the best. I agreed and foolishly started doing weird thing, took part in a contest which would have won me a house and I would get her back. It was plain stupid but as exp 

What lessons did you learn from your serious relationship that ended in a breakup? Have you truly moved on? Do you still remember him/her? What advice from your experience would you give to others?
Life changing lessons are the ones learned the hard way. Mine wouldn’t qualify as a serious relationship according to many people’s standards of what is a serious relationship given that it didn't last long , but I took it seriously. How did it change me as a person? I discovered another weakness of my own.I was a tough guy. Or at least I thought so. I was very confident about how I can handle my emotions. I knew I loved this girl very much but when we broke up, I found that I loved her even much more. Never before have I thought that loving someone can take me that far.This helped me to know t 

Yes to all your sub - questions. What have I learnt? 1) Never make your relationship your everything in life. I don't mean to say that I forgot to focus on studies or health or anything like that, but I was living inside a bubble where it was just me and him.  2) DON'T STOP TALKING TO FRIENDS. This might seem obvious, but this happens in relationships. You gradually start moving away from all your close friends and when shit hits the fan, you feel more lonely than ever not because your friends aren't there anymore, but because you yourself are not comfortable with talking to your friends anym 

Before sharing my story, I would like to make it clear that I don't like using the term "ex-girlfriend" and the like for multiple reasons. Foremost, the two-letter prefix reminds me of a red giant "X" drawn over an intimate two-year relationship that I have experienced. This ultimately dismisses the affection I shared with my significant other and the memories we crafted labeling it as mundane. Certainly, this relationship was special to me as it helped me establishing my personality and building my self-esteem. The ex-prefix denigrates this role and diminishes its persistent effects on my lif 

I learned a great many things from my previous relationship. Here's a few. Never change yourself for the person you're with. This sounds tricky, because some people change their hair or clothing style for the SO, but I mean things you actually can't change. My ex and his family was loud, outgoing, and expected me to be. I was, and always have been, reserved and quiet, especially around people I don't know. They actually took offense to this, and it caused a rift that didn't really ever mend. But, as it's an inherent personality trait, I realized eventually that their, and his, perception of tha

What lessons did you learn from your serious relationship that ended in a breakup? Personally, it was nothing short of magic, while it lasted. I was totally into her. She was my everything. Every single day, I looked for ways to make her happy. Because if I somehow managed to make her day, that made my day. It ended. And like everyone else, even I thought it would last forever, even I thought she would come back, and even I regretted my decisions and blamed myself for everything. Lessons? Never blame yourself. A clap needs two hands. If it was your fault, it was hers too.There is nothing like ‘the

So there are four questions. I would write briefly on all the four. Quite honestly, by writing this answer on Quora at midnight, I am getting an outburst of overwhelming thoughts and emotions since I have just had a breakup. What was more unfortunate than the breakup itself, is that it ended on an ugly note. I had prayed that if ever the time comes to part our ways let that happen on a mutual agreement with little or no hard feelings for each other. Yet, just the opposite happened. We were in a relationship for more than 7 years. 7 years is a good long time and the lessons that I've learnt are 

I was married to a man that was as good a man as any woman could ask for. A real head turner at that. Any woman would have thought I was crazy to have skipped states for a time to pursue my dreams. But I was young &amp; would have resented him had I not. He didn't want to come with me and had nothing holding him back, so perhaps he played a part as well. Utlimately, I took a selfish though. When I was there, the ball started rolling with my music career and I was looking at the third record deal on the table. That's when I became a statistic.

I learnt that small initial red flags that you overlook because "she is the one" will come down on you as meteors later on. I learnt to be more aware when getting to know a new person, and that it is useful to contain limerence for a little while - control your emotions - so you can really see who they are. I learnt that you can try to help struggling souls, but that you cannot fix all. I still believe in the good, but some people are too lost, and life is too short to try to help them, against their will. I learnt that love doesn't conquer all and that you need compatibility, a lot in common, a 

I had been through 3 serious relationships before I got married to perfect man Lesson 1:  Starting with the first one, I was a naive 22 year old, straight out of college, onto my first job, never had been in a relationship before that since I had been focusing on my education to land a suitable job. Once I had it I used be thinking about a rosy picture about falling in love and getting married. With my narrow frame of mind I used to think the ideal age for getting married is 24 or 25. Enter boyfriend 1, my senior from the same college, working in a software company, from the same city who befrien 

Every relationship has something to teach us, because it reveals something to us about ourselves that enriches us going forward. In my case, I learnt that:  Timing is often everything. You may have met the greatest person in your life and the two of you might be the most compatible and both have strong feelings for each other, but if one of you has a different life goal at the time (perhaps starting a family, having children, moving abroad to study or work), then love will not necessarily conquer all, like it happens in Hollywood movies.We all have something in us that makes us attractive, so lo

If a man loves you but doesn't want to marry you, what does that mean?
Been there done that. I was majorly crazy in love with a man and we made plans to marry. Eventually he wasn't calling as often and I finally got the idea he was no longer interested but stupid me started showing up everywhere I thought he would be. Waste of time until I found him at his friends apartment parked outside with another girl inside his car with him. I didn't do anything and I don't know if he saw me cause the two of them were pretty busy testing each other's kissing prowess. I didn't see him for a long time and then one night I was with friends and he saw us, came over and we chatt 

After reading all of the cynical answers, I have to weigh in on this. I have been married twice and divorced twice.  I ended the first marriage, and my 2nd wife ended the second marriage.  I have been with my girlfriend for over two years now, and I love her very much, but I will not marry her.  Why?  Because I do not see the need to.  Being married did not add anything to my previous relationships.  It did not make us love each other more or keep us loving each other.  It just made things extremely more difficult when one of us realized that the person they were with was not the right person f 

It just means that love and marriage aren’t necessarily very closely related to each other. A song claims that love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage, but if you think about that, horses have been doing just fine since long before carriages, and people still love their horses even though very few put carriages on them. Love is between two people. People can love each other, live together, share their lives, even have joint accounts and joint mortgages together without getting married. Marriage brings in the government, relatives, and everybody else. Marriage is about death, mone 

I can’t say that clearly but maybe you can find the answer in this article below. I were once talking to a male friend who told me that men essentially have a desire to have a fling, it's just a matter of whether or not It's just a chance. When some women warp their heads in front of them, they lust for them, like wagging a bone in front of a dog, they will make a grabbing, panting, begging pose. But a man isn't always a flirt, at least for a normal man who can be in a cool phase 98% of the time. If a man loves you as more than sleeping with you, then in addition to being interested in a naked y 

From an Indian perspective, it (practically) means that it’s time to break up and move on. The guy is just dillydallying with you and maybe even hopes to get intimate with you, but… is not willing to go against the wishes of his familyhas someone else on his mind with whom he is planning to do the ‘settle down’ bit… a ‘better catch’ perhapshas other issues with you that he is not entirely comfortable talking about and so he’s taking the easy way outthinks you’re fun, but doesn’t think that you’ll fit into his idea of a wifehas a basketful of other reasons best known to himFrom a western perspec 

There are many reasons why he may not want to marry you, and only he can explain exactly why. I would say the two most common reasons for a man not wanting to marry a woman he is in love with are: He just isn’t ready. Marriage is a HUGE commitment, and most guys only want to do it once! Depending on how long you two have been together, it might be too soon for him. People are getting married sooner and sooner these days, as technology moves our lives faster and faster, and I believe that is one of the main reasons for the high divorce rates. You should date a guy for a couple of years before yo 

These days it means he's smart. If a marriage tanks the way things are now the man just gets beat to his knees and it's very hard to recover afterwards. There is no law in family court and whatever the woman says is gospel. I walked into that place with a mansion of a house, two kids, the cars and the idea of a fair split and left with zero. She never worked a day in twenty years and told two unimaginable lies in that court and sank me. So if you were a man would you consider marriage? I know I will never do it again no matter who she is. If you really want to see if that falls into your cate 

 It doesn’t have to mean anything at all, especially not in terms of love. For most of us love does not have to correlate with marriage. You can love someone you never marry just as much as you can marry someone you never loved. That being said, here are a few reasons your man might have for not marrying you although he still loves you: He is not ready - Marriage is a huge commitment, especially if it is your first marriage. Your man probably wants to support you and give you the best life he can and unless he is sure of that for himself he may not take that extra step.He still has doubts or is sc

It just means that he (or she ) is not ready to be married. This could be for an almost infinite number of reasons and every single one of those reasons is legitimate. The one who doesn’t want to marry might not even know for sure WHY he/she doesn’t want to marry or to marry now or soon and even that non-reason is absolutely legitimate. Marriage is just too serious and important not to listen to your gut, even if everyone else is pushing for a wedding and the hesitant party can’t come up with a solid reason to explain why they are not ready. Not being ready, willing and excited to get married  

A good framework for analyzing this situation is provided by the "Triangular theory of love" (http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Triangular_theory_of_love).  According to this theory, the three main components of love are: Intimacy – Which encompasses feelings of attachment, closeness, connectedness, and bondedness. Passion – Which encompasses drives connected to both limerence and sexual attraction. Commitment – Which encompasses, in the short term, the decision to remain with another, and in the long term, plans made with that other. In a perfect relationship, all three components would be 

How can you tell if someone really loves you or just settling with you?
REAL LOVE looks like this: Paying attention to detailed, minute things you like. For instance, we were going to go camping, and we were looking at percolators to order on Amazon. We had to choose between green or blue speckle for the color. My boyfriend’s favorite color is green, but I have a love for blue speckled cookware. I mentioned this and said I thought blue speckled coffee cups are adorable. When the Amazon package arrived, not only was there a blue speckled percolator, there were two blue speckled coffee cups as a little surprise.Unwavering support. Do you want to run a marathon? Learn

Do you believe in constellations? Anyway, I believe that I also taught myself Tarot cards, and today I want to share with you how to judge whether the 12 constellations really love you or just settling with you. Aries: If he really loves you, he will confess directly, if he perfuses you, he will keep his distance If Aries really loves you, they will confess to you directly, and they can't help but want to be together! If Aries is perfunctory, you will keep a distance from you. Although sometimes you have a good conversation, there is always a sense of distance. Taurus: If he really loves you, he w 

Every human being has an innate ability to detect romantic interest in the people they meet. The warmth you feel (or lack thereof) when the other person stares at you, holds you, and talks to you, are things that cannot be measured quantitatively, but can be detected with a great deal of accuracy through personal interactions. Signs of settling: Constantly comparing you to other people and pointing out what you lackA short attention span when you speak and a general lack of interest in you as an individualAn inability or unwillingness to claim you when speaking to an attractive person from the o

Are they afraid to upset you? if they are, it’s not love. They are using you. They don’t want you to leave because they see benefits in you. They love you when they make time for you with no excuse. You ask for time, and they are there. It don’t even have to be love. It’s to show that they are genuine. IF they care, they will put effort in you and have no thought of leaving at all. They are patient with you. Your a priority. Look at the actions not words. Talk is cheap. you hear them a dime a dozen. Too often people make promises and break them. they say they will never get married due to past 

1. You can define whether a person is really loves you by observing his attitude in response to your message. If a person truly loves you, there are not too many defenses and routines, he will take the messages you send seriously and response you timely, because he cares about you which can not pretend. If you do not feel the kind of care he has for you, you send the message to him and will not able to be responded in time, it is clear that you are not so important to him. Only the one who really loves you will take your emotions into account, these details in the daily is the most real. The more 

Settling can be for anything money, appearances, lifestyle, safety, fear, ect. I think deep down they know, but they either don’t care or are afraid. There wont be that same mutual feeling of love, and it could be one sided or just not there. Something will feel missing, and wven I love you doesn’t prove they love you. It could be I love you for _________. Are people actually happy settling? I don’t think it’s any better than being alone. And being alone doesn't always mean you’re unhappy. Settling with someone who is completely in love with you is wrong to me. If you can’t fully love and appr 

Just like any precious thing in the world, true love also needs to be precipitated through time, and its quality can only be revealed when the days are gradually flat. When the conflict between you is on the verge of conflict, a man who really loves you will show you： He is tolerant and can give you a corrective emotional experience; He will protect you from further harm; He is calm, has a kind of determination not to involve himself in the emotional storm, can stop when it is not suitable for communication; He is clear and firm in solving problems and does not avoid them, which will make you feel  

Probably the shortest answer I can offer you- they cherish and treat you as a unity. People who just want to settle with you will admire and even respect you for traits they find amazing(e.g. intelligence, good looks, creativity). However, they will, and I do mean will, belittle you at the first sight of doubt or fragility coming from you. Because they fear they won’t use you for their needs(sexual, emotional etc.) and you slowly but surely become less of what they imagine happiness is. Who loves you? Someone who sees and understands that you have an infinity interval, however big or small, that 

How can you tell if someone really loves you? Simple. You have to focus on their actions, on how they treat you and on how much time they spend with you. Focus on the pattern of their behavior. If a person only checks on you once a week, because they want to hook up, that’s not love.If a person consistently makes an effort to stay in contact with you instead, it’s a great thing.If someone consistently takes care of you and makes nice gestures to make your life easier, that’s probably love.When a person is always there for you , even during your worst moments, that’s love.Also, make sure they are 

Maybe different people have different ideas about love. Sometimes, love relates with sex. But sex do not be equal to love. As a woman, I have no idea to understand men. But I have some tips for girls. Paying attention to it, sex doesn’t mean the love. The man who asks you to go to private occasions for any reason, even wants to make sex with you at the first time. He doesn’t love you, remerber it. He just wants to make sex with you! Maybe many men doesn’t agree with point, but I still would like to say it loudly. Gilrs, don't have any illusions! Your love for him cannot be touched, he just wants 

What is usually considered husband material?
What is the most embarrassing thing your parents have caught you doing with your bf/gf?
When we were Young I was at a friend's house and we were messing around outside, and he says let's go in my basement. We were messing around with some of his stuff any turns to me and says that he really enjoyed rubbing himself. I didn't know what to say. He starts taking his hand and starts rubbing himself through his pants. I could see him getting excited right away. He said to me why don't you try it and reaches over grabs my hand and starts me rubbing myself. Needless to say it didn't take me long and I was excited. First time I was ever doing anything like this. As we're both are getting  

It was a calm and quiet Friday night. All I could hear was a ticking clock and our refrigerator whirring in the background. Our black Labrador Retriever, Rosebud, was following me around, licking her chops. I was a junior in high school at the time and I was alone in the house with my father, who was working quietly in his den. My mom was in Las Vegas for the weekend, celebrating my aunt’s birthday, while my younger sister was at a friend’s house for a sleepover. My dad was one of those people who, when involved in a project, would be so lost in concentration that he would lose all track of tim 

First of all, I have got the wierdest life on this planet, so this has happened a few times. This was the most interesting (however, she was not exactly my girlfriend and not exactly my mom): I am a boy. I got raised by gay moms because my parents divorced when I would just breastfeed. My real dad remarried soon and had a daughter just a year younger than me, let's call her Ava, and her wife, let's call her Dior. Not forcing but you will enjoy this more after reading this too: So, I fell in love suddenly with Ava and we would pull off our clothes whenever my dad and Dior would leave the house. Two 

Well, this story is pretty embarrassing but it doesn’t involve my parents, it involves my boyfriend’s dad. So, being we started off as really good friends, I was always allowed over. Stayed most weekends, in fact. Well, for the majority of his life, my boyfriend, “J,” has only lived with his mother after his parents divorced a little over a decade ago. His dad recently moved in with them, as he had gotten a new job and it would be much easier for him to get to this new job from J’s house, as opposed to where he had been staying, much further away. So J’s mom offered to let his dad stay. It was  

Unfortunately I have been caught with 3-4 of my ex-girlfriends since I was 16. So I have a few stories to choose from. The most recent was last summer, my ex girlfriend and I were living with my mom and she was out of town for the previous week. Unfortunately she came home a few days early.It was about noon, and her and I were in the middle of the living room but naked! This ex and I were wild when it came to sex. Try most anything once. She has asked in the past if she could try licking my asshole. We had already finished a huge bottle of Vodka (by noon) .She said that she liked it when I lic 

All similar to many of the others. Yes, it involves sexual content. (Not my parents but his!) so ok, I was 16, visiting my school bf of 17 at the time. It was late at night. Probably round 11 or so. Most of house was asleep. Or so we thought. We were under a duvet, making out on the couch in the tv room late at night. We soon got naked from waist down and got busy. I was lying on my side in front of him and he was giving it to me from behind. Real nice, slow passionate love making. Suddenly his brother (2yrs older) walks in. It did not help that I had a major crush on him too.. .. Brother says " 

I'm glad my brother doesn't have a quora but this story is based on him. He used to routinely bring his girlfriend over to the house when my parents were out and I wasn't born yet so I didn't get to make fun of him even more. One day mom decided to pop out for grocery shopping. So my brother rang up his girlfriend to come over. They were at home for a few hours and then they heard the sound of a car pulling over in to the car park. My brother is panicking and he quickly jumps up and proceeds to drag his girlfriend around looking for a place to hide her. He hears mom coming up the stairs and then 

I’m 13 and me and my gf have been dating for about 6 months so one time i told my mom that if my gf can come over and we can hang out in the pool [At this point we have been dating for 2 months.] so my mom said ofc she can so i called my gf and the next day it was a sunday she came over and i took her to meet my mom and dad and they really liked her. After that i took her to my room and we were watching a movie. When the movie ended i said lets go to the pool and we went to go change and then we she came out i was like dam you look sexy and the she blushed and we kissed and i loved it. We got  

My good friend was dating my sister and had snuck into her room to make out with her thru her bedroom 

 I was in 10th grade and I had exams. My father and mother got separated when I was only 8 years old and it had made me devastated. My mother was a working woman and because of work she had to go to out of city sometimes for a day. She used to drop one of my grandparents at home and I was quite attached to both of them. One day on April 24, 2014, my mother had to go out of city for a day and she asked me to stay at my grandparent’s house or call them at home. She was quite busy at that time that she didn’t even had time to call them. I had another plan in my mind, I thought I would call my then  

What should you do if Jungkook is your boyfriend?
Should you break up with your boyfriend to see if he'll fight for you?
….No. If this is your mindset, you shouldn’t be in a relationship. You shouldn’t be playing an emotional manipulation game that will leave at least one of you broken. You could get hurt physically and/or emotionally. He could be hurt. It is a lose-lose situation. When we got together, I was a fun, charismatic, sweet, confident girl. J, my love, was so infatuated with me. We had a playful relationship. We took it slow, but once our relationship picked up, we moved fast. We moved in together and out of state, and shortly thereafter I became pregnant. We were very much in love. During my pregnancy a 

“Should you breakup with your boyfriend to see if he’ll fight for you?” Oh boy, the question that every high school girl asks herself! Let’s analyze the possible outcomes. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say that there are two kinds of guys. These are good guys and bad guys. This is not meant in any cheesy, superhero-esque manner. These are the boys who will respect your decision and those who won’t. We also have another variable to consider. This is based on if he believes you are truly demanding a breakup or if he sees through your games and sees that it is a test. Once again, we will call th 

I would not recommend this. When you’re making this sort of judgment call, there are two questions I’d suggest asking yourself, one internal, one external: Is my action me being the authentic me or me trying to manipulate?What sort of men will this behavior systematically select for?You’re going to go through a lot of heartbreak and rejection in your dating life, but you know what’s worse than being rejected? Being with someone with whom you’re incompatible. Being in a bad relationship is worse than being single, and that’s not just my anecdote saying that - there’s research in fields ranging fr 

I used to be someone who believed that a person who truly loves you will fight for you but a sweet rather eye opening conversation changed the way I looked at it. I asked this question to my husband once like every other innocent woman wanting to know the depth of her lover’s affection for her. Too many movies have spoilt us like that where a man keeps pursuing a women until she returns to him. So, I asked my husband “What If I decided to leave you? will you stop me?” He said “no, I will not stop you”. I was taken aback. I shouted “what?why won’t you?Don’t you love me?” He said “I won’t stop you be

It didn't matter that she had little charcoal-colored, troublemaker eyes, that she'd just started hysterically crying on the bar or that I, a complete stranger, was suddenly the only thing standing between her and an aspirin binge. It was her fault, so I told her. “I hate to say this,” I said. “But it's all your fault.” “What?” she asked incredulously through her tears. “You br 

Turn the question around and ask the same thing but to yourself. “Should someone break up with you to see if you’ll fight for them?” If you wouldn’t want it for yourself, why would you put that through someone else? Anyone who wants to do this shows they aren’t serious about their partner and they’re only wanting an ego boost. If it comes down to the point where circumstances happen outside of people’s control, then fine, a test of loyalty can happen at its natural due course. However, forcing this purely to see if someone will fight for you will end up traumatising the person, and scarring them 

An ex did that to me, and that was an awful move that made her regret for months until we broke up for good. We had an apparently normal relationship but then she began to act distant and “chat” with other guys. Due to that, I've realized that was time to split up but I (naively) tried to fix things up, no answer from her and we eventually broke up. I felt that “bitter breakup feeling” and questioning why relationships are so complicated. I met another girl and we began to date… Without knowing that my ex would rose up and interfere. After four months she gave me the explanation I demanded to kno 

Warning this is a long answer once upon a time I had a girlfriend who was just my girlfriend to use me (I know you are asking what this has to do with the topic but you’ll understand in a moment) she wasn’t a bad person we were both teenagers and as you can imagine she didn’t think it would hurt me she thought I would eventually break with her or she wouldn’t be discovered and she will go to another school and we would both forget about it, I don’t know but when I realized I was broken and the worst part is that I was in depression already so I started to think about really bad ways out of the  

I honestly want to test the validity of the question. But regardless, Should you break up with your boyfriend to see if he’ll fight for you? Yes, Leave the person who’s devoting his love to you in a spiraling emotional explosion that’ll leave him confused and testing his real feelings for you while you sit back and look at him. Look at this guy who’s going through emotional torment and wonder, ”Why the hell is he respecting my boundaries and decision instead of being irrational and begging for me back?” Rather great choice really. See where I went? It’s a great idea to throw someone’s heart on the floo 

I’ve never been a games player in relationships. This kind of insecure manipulative bullshit never had the (presumed) desired effect on me. My attitude has always been: You want to play mind games? Play them with someone else. I’m going to be completely honest with you, and open in my communication of exactly how I feel - even in my own insecurities. If you break up with me, that’s not an indication you want to continue to be in a relationship with me, and not an indication I need to “fight for you” or some other immature bullshit you only see in hackneyed romcoms and from other broken insecure

How do mothers prepare their daughters for boyfriends?
My boyfriend is married, and he wants to divorce her and have me pay for an attorney.  Does that make sense?
Does it make sense that your boyfriend is asking you to pay for an expense that he should be footing the bill for? Yes. It makes perfect sense. Asking you for money to pay expenses that 99.99% of the civilized world would acknowledge to be his sole responsibility is consistent with your boyfriend’s longstanding pattern of selfish behavior. Your boyfriend is remarkably consistent. From the 24 words in your description of this boyfriend’s behavior, we have learned the following things about him: He cheats on his wife.He is willing to leave his wife for another woman.He is a financial mooch.Does it 

He is likely not wanting to divorce his wife. If he is asking for money to divorce it is more likely he, or even they, have targeted you and are trying to fleece you financially. He becomes your ‘boyfriend' and then tells you a tale of wanting divorce to be with you but poor him can't afford it, can you help? You give your prince your money and he and probably his wife laugh all the way to the bank. A life tip is that a married man is never available for you. At all. I would tell him that his divorce is his own responsibility and you are not giving a cent. His life is his responsibility, not y 

My dear, he does not seem a reliable person. leving you to marry someone then divorcing her and expecting you to pay for an attorney to make that happen has to be the oldest trick in the world. . I presume he is able bodied, why does he not have SOME savings himself. Also there are a number of agencies who help people without a fee or a very minimal fee if they can not afford legal representation. And lastly, I do not feel that he would spend the money on divorcing the wife, and even if he actually did, how long would it be before he leaves you to find another girlfriend. You can be much better  

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎆! 🎠 really 😂😂😂 Oh HELL NO !!!! If some guy asked me that, I'd take that extra money I had that he wants me to spend on HIS divorce lawyer &amp; go buy a case of real nice champagne &amp; 🎉🙌 🍷💃 to celebrate being single &amp; not having an asshole like him in my life !!! That piece of worthless shit is his wife's problem, not yours. Be a sweetie &amp; give the wife a heads up to what her hubby is up to. In fact invite her over for a girls night to drink the champagne &amp; you can both celebrate not having that brainless penis in your life anymore 😀 call it the divorce American style party. 314 views · View upvotes171Related QuestionsMore Answers BelowShould I wait for my boyfriend to get a divorce where the wife is hellbent on not giving in just because he is dating me? We have been together for 8 years now and I am going to touch 30 this year. I want to get married to my boyfriend so much but he said he's not ready, what should I do? After 18 months being together, I found out my boyfriend is married and has 4 kids (1 from a previous marriage). He is now going through a divorce and says he wants to be with me but I’m really struggling to leave him and move forward. What can I do? I like a man who is married, how do I get him to leave his wife? I am in love with a married man having 2 kids. He will take divorce as per him.

Nope.Get outta that relationship. If you WANT a sleazy liar ,stay with him. He not only is cheating on his wife ,but wants YOU to pay for his attorney as well..Girl , you're getting screwed in more ways than one. Run away fast as possible .

This was your early call to b 

This guy is a real loser if he expects you to pay for his divorce. I would show him the door and tell him not to come back until his divorce is final and I would also tell him that when he comes back, that is when I will make a decision regarding letting him back in my life. You don’t say if he is still living with her or not. I suspect he is. Have a little respect for yourself because what I see is you supposedly paying for his divorce and him spending your money and never actually getting a divorce. I’d be kicking his sorry ass to the curb if I were you. This guy is playing you for fool. 169 views · View upvotes3Angela Birch, BA from Pepperdine University (1974)Answered February 9, 2021 · Author has 2.7K answers and 788.6K answer views

Only if you fell on your head hard at some time in the past and for a variety of reasons. you are dating a cheater he is going to cheat on youHis divorce is his responsibility.Does the guy have a job or does he see you as a meal ticket.Why would you even consider it? Lots of good honest guys out there who would pay their own way. The guy is a greedy and to be honest if you consider it what assurance do you have he won’t head out to his other girlfriend. If the guy has any real interest in getting a divorce and marrying you, sit back and see if HE does it.Does he expect you to hand him the money

He is a user. Leave him. Also stop committing adultery. You have no business being with another woman's husband and baby daddy. Seriously gain some self respect and stop being a home wrecker. Maybe one day you can look forward to him divorcing you with his new girlfriend funding the divorce. There are plenty available men in the world, don't go taking another woman's husband. You have no right to destroy another woman's happiness and security, ever. You have the choice not to commit adultery. Just because he is willing doesn't mean you should accept his offer. You are better than this and can  

I think you need to trade up. So he is your boyfriend but is married. Was he at least separated before he started dating you? Or was he living with his wife and dating you on the side? Now there could be other issues going on, but wanting his girlfriend to pay for the lawyer to get him a divorce from his wife does indeed sound sketchy. Might be for reals - he is stuck in a marriage he doesn’t want, is short on money, and wants to be with you after the divorce. But be very, VERY careful. 169 views · View upvotes4David Kingsley, Commercial Diver (2018-present)Answered January 23, 2021 · Author has 924 answers and 693.7K answer viewsOriginally Answered: My boyfriend is married now he is wanting to divorce her and he want me to pay for an attorney does that make sense?

No… It doesn't… what are you thinking? Are you so lonely that you have to have an affair with a married man? Look, if he's doing this to his WIFE, what makes you think he won't cheat on YOU… didn't really think about this did you? Well, back to my answer… Why would YOU pay for the divorce of some loser you've been screwing? You do realize he's probably using you right?

Is it true that guys have a harder time getting a girlfriend than girls have getting a boyfriend?
Yes and no.  However, let's assume that your quote is in its entirity "for every girl there are 3 guys fighting for her to be her boyfriend".  There are several factors at play here -  1) The social expectation that men take the domineering hand in the interactions between the sexes. Blame it on the patriachy if you wish, but one major hangover of the patriachy is that men are considered to be the askers out. There is still a lot of stigma attached to women asking a guy out - and let's face it, not having to face rejection is quite attractive - and so most women won't ask a guy out. *Before peop 

That’s odd. I saw so many answers here saying “Yes! It’s true! Guys are way harder to get a girlfriend!” But but but… Why so many girls asked me for matchmaking but no guy has ever asked me for the same? I must be a rare case. Maybe because I’m a woman. Maybe because I know more girls than guys. I need more samples. So this weekend I did this “survey” to 98 of my coworkers/friends/relatives… people I know and I could reach. (I’m a Chinese.

Hey! I would have to say in my opinion possibly yes but not significantly. Obviously I have never been a man looking for a woman but with that in mind I have a few thoughts. Firstly that saying “"for every girl there are 3 guys fighting for her” is not true.

Probably not. Age and social status play a huge factor in the equation for any particular individual but on average more women are looking for a relationship than men are. Look on any dating site and the number of women seeking a long term relationship or with words like “if you’re looking for casual sex or a hook don’t bother contacting me” in their profile would lead one to believe that they’re experiencing a lot of players or guys who don’t want anything more than casual.

This statement is incorrect (and stupid). Let me prove it to you mathematically.  Assume that there are 100 people in a population, with number of girls and boys equal. Of the 50 possible couples, assume that only 20 relationships actually materialise. You know what that means? It means that 30 girls and 30 boys don’t have a significant other. At any point in time, when there is a relationship - it means that the girl has a boyfriend and the boy has a girlfriend. If there is no relationship, it means the girl does not have a boyfriend and the boy does not have a girlfriend. Therefore, statistically

Turn the question around and ask the same thing but to yourself. “Should someone break up with you to see if you’ll fight for them?” If you wouldn’t want it for yourself, why would you put that through someone else?

An ex did that to me, and that was an awful move that made her regret for months until we broke up for good.

I honestly want to test the validity of the question. But regardless, Should you break up with your boyfriend to see if he’ll fight for you? Yes, Leave the person who’s devoting his love to you in a spiraling emotional explosion that’ll leave him confused and testing his real feelings for you while you sit back and look at him. Look at this guy who’s going through emotional torment and wonder, ”Why the hell is he respecting my boundaries and decision instead of being irrational and begging for me back?” Rather great choice really.

I’ve never been a games player in relationships. This kind of insecure manipulative bullshit never had the (presumed) desired effect on me. My attitude has always been: You want to play mind games? Play them with someone else. I’m going to be completely honest with you, and open in my communication of exactly how I feel - even in my own insecurities. If you break up with me, that’s not an indication you want to continue to be in a relationship with me, and not an indication I need to “fight for you” or some other immature bullshit you only see in hackneyed romcoms and from other broken insecure 

Why doesn't my boyfriend ever compliment me?
Should you break up with your boyfriend to see if he'll fight for you?
….No. If this is your mindset, you shouldn’t be in a relationship. You shouldn’t be playing an emotional manipulation game that will leave at least one of you broken. You could get hurt physically and/or emotionally. He could be hurt. It is a lose-lose situation. When we got together, I was a fun, charismatic, sweet, confident girl. J, my love, was so infatuated with me. We had a playful relationship. We took it slow, but once our relationship picked up, we moved fast. We moved in together and out of state, and shortly thereafter I became pregnant. We were very much in love. During my pregnancy a 

“Should you breakup with your boyfriend to see if he’ll fight for you?” Oh boy, the question that every high school girl asks herself! Let’s analyze the possible outcomes. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say that there are two kinds of guys. These are good guys and bad guys. This is not meant in any cheesy, superhero-esque manner. These are the boys who will respect your decision and those who won’t. We also have another variable to consider. This is based on if he believes you are truly demanding a breakup or if he sees through your games and sees that it is a test. Once again, we will call th 

I would not recommend this. When you’re making this sort of judgment call, there are two questions I’d suggest asking yourself, one internal, one external: Is my action me being the authentic me or me trying to manipulate?What sort of men will this behavior systematically select for?You’re going to go through a lot of heartbreak and rejection in your dating life, but you know what’s worse than being rejected? Being with someone with whom you’re incompatible. Being in a bad relationship is worse than being single, and that’s not just my anecdote saying that - there’s research in fields ranging fr 

I used to be someone who believed that a person who truly loves you will fight for you but a sweet rather eye opening conversation changed the way I looked at it. I asked this question to my husband once like every other innocent woman wanting to know the depth of her lover’s affection for her. Too many movies have spoilt us like that where a man keeps pursuing a women until she returns to him. So, I asked my husband “What If I decided to leave you? will you stop me?” He said “no, I will not stop you”. I was taken aback. I shouted “what?why won’t you?Don’t you love me?” He said “I won’t stop you be

What should I do if my online boyfriend doesn't want to stop chatting/calling his online female friends telling me they're just his friends, he won't like them, and he met them before me?
What are the benefits of having a boyfriend?
The advantages of having a boyfriend will depend on what kind of person your boyfriend is. But these are the benefits I've experienced the past four years with mine: A pillow. It’s so great to rest my head against him. Whether I have my head on his shoulder out in public, or I'm napping on his chest at home, he's comfortable to lean on.A cheerleader. No one believes in me more than him. He encourages me, pushes me, believes in me. Whether it's good luck before a test or help practicing for an interview, he is my biggest support.A moral compass. He has pushed me to be a better person. I think of

If your boyfriend is your best friend and if you guys have an unconditional bonding of true love and true friendship, from the deep bottom of the heart, then you will have the following advantages - 1.You will have a person to share your heart out.. He will listen to even your silly things.. He will always have time for you, because you are extra special for him .. Your happiness and well being means more to him, than his own.. Because that's true love.. When you thrive to make your beloved one's happy, no matter how much pain you are going through…:) :) :) 2.He will always make you happy, will  

I cannot answer for all boyfriends, but here are the advantages of my boyfriend. He can open all the tight jars and bottles. No problem for him.He gets rid of the spiders. He knows I'm afraid of spiders. He is, too, but he still does it for me.He cheers me up when I'm unhappy. It seems like he's unhappy as long as I'm unhappy.He listens to the stuff I have to say. And not only does he listen, he also actually cares about what I say and asks me to tell him more about that stuff. He also leaves me alone when I don't want to talk.He has different political views (he's libertarian, I'm one of those

My youngest, when she was in her mid-20s, would often ask me to decipher what her current b/f meant when he said/did something. I would tell her what it meant, whereupon she’d tell me that that was the dumbest thing she’d ever heard. (We could’ve scripted these conversations; they always came out the same.) ACT I: THE PRESENT: I’d say “I’m not disagreeing with you, but that’s what your b/f meant.” Her: “You’re just a cynical bastard and you’re just saying this to run down men.” Me: “I am a cynical bastard and running down men is really kinda fun because there’s so much material to work with, but I

Why is it after every argument with my boyfriend he wants to break up with me?
I did this in a past relationship once. Yes, I was that horrible guy. It was a brutal relationship, and after going to a therapist about it, I have a better understanding of what happened. There is something called “attachment style”. Oversimplifying here, but basically everyone has a specific attachment style: secure, anxious, avoidant. This style dictates how one responds to specific triggers in a relationship. What’s a trigger? Basically anything that pisses someone off, even marginally. Maybe it’s something simple, like not complementing you the right way (“Honey, that dress really doesn’t f 

Sounds like a manipulative ex husband of mine. Every time he was losing an argument, which was every argument, the idiot would threaten, “That’s it, I’m leaving”. At the time, I was in graduate school and needed the degree to be able to support myself and my son, free from worry. I was shocked that he would threaten such a drastic measure over something so petty, but he assured me he meant it. I spoke to one of my professors, a psychologist, about my spouse’s behavior and he told me that any threat of abandonment by a partner was emotional abuse. Unbeknownst to me, it was an empty threat, desi 

Well, it sounds to me like your boyfriend (and possibly you too..?) has a form of separation anxiety. That is, he has abandonment issues; which he has not even realized, nor dealt with successfully, on a conscious level. First, what you refer to as “arguing” is more likely better described as “fighting” with your guy. The reason I say this, is because having an actual adult, logical arguement, means two people having a difference of opinion (for whatever reason) convey to each other their own perspective on the subject matter. And, it is where an open forum for the exchange of ideas between tw 

Believe it or not, not everyone fights. Those who do, think fighting is normal as they think arguing is. Those who don’t fight or argue have learned better ways of communicating. Regardless of one’s lifestyle choices, I would say if someone wants to end it at any point for whatever reason, it’s always good to politely respect their wishes. Personally, I won’t keep company with anyone I have to argue with. Thus my life has mostly been fight free since I got a divorce. Granted those two following fights took 3 to 6 months to conclude as I was trying to get rid of them, but I was finally successful 

He doesn't really want to breka up with you he wants to threaten and use your feelings for him to get his way. My now wife did that to me once when we were still dating. I don't even remember why she threanted the relationship or what she was upset about.i dont even doubt she had good rwason and I love het more than anything but you know what I told her? If you ever threaten our relationship again dont brother coming back.Whatever I do to upset her or she does to upset me we need to try work it out and talk though it. If we cant do that then then the relationship isn't worth saving .I am 51 an 

Many things. You said “every argument” which indicate, quite a few. Ask yourself, how often do you have them and how bad the arguments ended? How often did you get to some sort of compromise? How often do you follow through on what you have agreed? The reason for your arguments, were they reasonable? How often your disagreement end in discussion and taken as difference in opinion without becoming an argument? Go on and ask yourself! When a person (irrespective of gender) generally thinks and threatens to walk away for any reason, it shows that they are tired of the repetitive and endless cycle  

Because he’s scared. Like the author below I also have an anxious attachment style which leads me to question whether someone will be there for me when I need them and I anticipate they won’t so my natural reaction is to want to leave. The first 18 months of my relationship I wanted to break up with my boyfriend EVERY DAY. Like, literally pack my stuff and run away. Fast. It wasn’t really him, it was the fear of letting someone in and being vulnerable and running away is much easier (and what I’ve always done in the past). So, I had to work on calming that fear (it still comes up but not as often 

I'm in this situation now, it's gotten to the point where we argue every week , it's been that way for months now, he got mad at me today because we were talking about his phone having a protective screen on it and I said I don't think it's you're phone because mine had the same marks from when it fell the screen protector was the only thing that broke but anyways he got smart with me about that and said I'm always trying to be right about everything and I said really I'm leaving, this man is 34 years old 2 kids a 2 year old and a 9 year old , he dated his ex for 10 years, she played him, chea 

I think both of you should re-evaluate your whole relationship, if this is the type of relationship you (both) really wants. Because i found it unhealthy in a relationship when one threat to leave the other one. Instead walk away from a relationship, a couple should try to work on their issue together My suggestion is try to have heart to heart talk with your boyfriend. Seems to me he is unhappy. Sometimes best to let go the unhappy ones, for them to be able to find peace of their mind. When people being unhappy in a relationship mind and heart is always forever at battle to one another. Give h 

Too often, people fail to see their own faults. It’s always the other person. We don’t know what your arguments are about. Maybe you pick fights with him over petty little things and he’s sick of it. Maybe he wants to break up, but doesn’t have the nerve unless presented with a situation easier to walk away from. The mere fact that you are still together, and that he has done this often enough you can say “after every argument” tells me that he does NOT want to break up with you. The way I see it, these are his two potential lines of thinking: Why do we argue all the time? It gets so frustratin

How did you tell your parents about your girlfriend/boyfriend?
I got commited with this girl on 21st Jan, 2014. I will start telling in a bit summarized way actually. So here I go. She was my tutionmate in 12th standard , we were a part of chemistry class. At that time , I used to stare and gaze her sometimes. She was beautiful and one cannot take eyes off after seeing her. Attractive she was. But at that time I had no guts to tell her about what I feel , I was shy. This happened in 2011. Fast forward to 2013. On 11th March, I was celebrating my birthday and was going through the facebook news feed , I was checking facebook for most of the day because of th 

This is so interesting. In 2016 I was obsessively single (of course I had a nasty break up) my girlfriends used send me on dates and once a guy left in the middle of the date. Since then I was more into NO relationship zone. Then my friends opened an account in a dating site where o came across my fiance. This is us. At the beginning it was just normal stuff and then we decided to meet and then the number of meetings increased. Luckily, his office is just 2 blocks away from my house. After Around 6 months of dating, I told him that I want to be with him. And he said the same (huge relief!) Our relat 

March 8th, 2019. I got permission from my office to leave early and paid a visit to my boy friend's place (he already told his parents and got green signal for our love) and had a nice time with him and his mother. She made semiya payasam and bajji (such a sweet gesture) for us as I visited their home for the 1st time after revealing our love. I wished her for the women's day and bid them bye. I was so happy that evening and carrying the same happiness I entered my home. As soon as I entered, my mother reminded me about a prospective groom which she shared few days ago and wanted me to answer the n 

It was just me and my mom in the hotel room. Dad had gone out to get me my favorite okra chips. We were randomly talking about places to visit and about the trips to plan once she retires in 2 years. Mom furthers the conversation saying you already save half your paid time offs every year, so it wouldn't be a problem taking 2 weeks off two years later. You would anyways have lots of leaves saved up by then. I have literally no idea where I got the courage from to blurt out the very next sentence at that instant. Me: Why would I be a third wheel on your trip? You and dad enjoy. I will go with my  

Well, it was a funny incident and the setup is like this: I had gone home for my Diwali vacations. Its around 7 pm in the evening. My father has just arrived from work and just as everyday, sits in the drawing room. Mother gets him tea and then joins him. Me and my sister are there in the other room. Now, I got bored and don’t know why, but I decided to just look at my mother’s stuff. While going through her purse, I came across a receipt. It was a receipt which was issued by an airport where my mother had been charged extra for her luggage. Now, the thing is, I talk to her everyday and she neve 

Going anonymous as I don’t want my friend’s on quora to know this too early… Although they can connect the dots with the details I am going to provide… Disclaimer: Long story ahead So before coming to the story, Let me introduce myself, 25 years old average guy here, very average. Born…Finished engineering… working with a mass recruiter where I don’t use any of my engineering knowledge… Now you have got a picture of me in mind.. Coming to the story, We did our engineering in a city other than our native. She was my classmate during our engineering. Also we both belong to same place(but we never knew ea 

My parents always wanted me to study , play and score well , they also used to enjoy my success and are proud of me , but I never really used to discuss anything else [ relationships etc ] , with them , as I used to think that they are a bit conservative and would consider all this a distraction . But the below incident changed my perspective . So my (now ex) girlfriend’s Birthday was coming up and it was her first birthday after we had started dating and I wanted to gift her something really special. This incident is back from when i was in school and getting cash in hand for anything was real 

My mom is a pretty blunt, and an open person. She knew my “boyfriend” from 2012, as he would come home very often in the pretext of being a close friend(which we were just that at this point). I knew her opinion and wishes about her future son-in-law. Sometime in 2013, she told me(which clearly indicated towards my boyfriend) - “Careful, it seems very difficult, you are off to Singapore, and he will be in India. He is from a different culture, you will have to adjust a lot.” However, I did not have a clue on what my dad expected from his future son-in-law. Whenever, the topic of my wedding woul 

My mom was frantically looking for prospective groom for me. My boyfriend and I were at extremely early stage of our relationship. He didnt wanted to talk about me to his family till we cross a year. And since I was also not sure about him, I was on the same page as him. One evening, I was suppose to meet some guy as an arrange marriage meeting, and I was not sure to tell my boyfriend or my mom about each other. Me and my boyfriend had talked about marriage but more like in a passing conversation, so I was not sure if we are even serious about it. So I did go to meet this arrange marriage guy,j 

I am working in a MNC in Bangalore. My parents were looking for a groom for me in our community. One fine day when I was in my hometown, I told my father and all members about my love. Me: Dad, there is non need to find a groom. I am in love with someone who is well settled * Interrupted by my father * Father: What is the caste of the guy? Me : Some XYZ caste. Father: Its wrong. Love will not work, he doesn belong to our community. Me : He is well settled, and his parents also agreed for this. Father: No, how can you marry a guy from other caste. Your sister and brother(cousins) will not get any mat 

Have you ever accidentally encountered your ex, several years after you parted? If so, what was the reaction?
It was the last night that I would ever see her alive. And it was also the last kiss we ever shared.  What I never wrote about, and now, I think it’s finally time, is the last night we were truly alone together. This wasn’t so much an accidental encounter, as an unconsciously willing one.  It’s 2002. She had been married to my oldest friend for 10 years. She was the mother to a 9 year old boy and a 7 year old girl who were both named after me (first and middle name). I was visiting in the area, a 2 day layover in the long trip home after a long stint working overseas. I was visiting family and deci 

YES. It was in the gym. Thanks to my myopia I didn't recognise him on the spot -he was something like 5 meters away- but I did notice the resemblance of the figure.. and there we was. My heart actually skipped a beat. For a second, it was like we never parted… same accellerated heart beats, same dizziness.. and just like that, it ended. We both went on with the training and didn't even greet. We parted after a 5 years relationship, I was 18 and he was 22 soon to be 23 when it started. We were DEEP in love, to be honest I think I'll never love anyone like I loved him. We used to dream about our fut 

Yes! Backstory: I discovered that my ex had been having *one and done* encounters since we had been married. Then, i find out he has started an actual affair. Then, as if those werent enough..i come home unexpectedly to find my best friend in my bed with him. She was his affair. I was shattered. Took my dog and left immediately. He pleaded with me not to go..that he loved me and the affair was only a piece of ass.. I said in response *a damn big piece of ass*. I encouraged him to tell me that he loved me so that she could hear because I wanted her to feel the pain and always to remember his words 

Let tell you a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down…Okay jokes aside, yes I actually ran into the man I was engaged to a couple of years after we had a very bad break up. Now I won’t go into the nasty details because at the end of the day we both made peace thanks to the run in. But for back story, I was 18 years old, I joined a roleplaying site for anime and nerd roleplay stuff. Yes I am a roleplaying via text. I enjoy it. I still do it. Infact I’m still on the site. I found him and the site on a whim via google. And joined in my senior year of highschool. I enjoyed the si 

I ran into my ex last week in Bangkok. It was awkward, to say the least. For background I’m an expat, posted in Thailand for several years, then to Beijing and then back to Thailand. My ex is a very wealthy Thai girl who was a university student at the best school in Thailand when we were dating and had just graduated when we broke up. We broke things off because I was moving to China. It wasn’t an awful breakup but there were definitely some hard feelings on her end. Honestly I felt bad myself. She’s absolutely gorgeous and very smart and we had a lot of fun together. This was 3 years ago. I  

This wasn't several years later, but my ex and I broke up in 2016, I joined the military in 2018 and started my current relationship Dec 2018, at this point my ex had completely removed me from all social media and we had had no contact in almost 2 years. A few months into 2019 I moved 600 miles away for work, but my girlfriend stayed. So being the one who made more money I traveled to her when I could. She was in college so I would attend her classes with her and participate in class discussions, since I had nothing better to do. Surprisingly on the way to one of her classes I saw my ex walking 

I was with someone on and off for two years back in 2014. At the tail end of 2014, I sent him (Let’s call him Pete*) an email (which is how he broke up with me twice during those two years) explaining that I knew I wanted more from him than he wanted and that the last two years I had been lying to myself thinking he would magically become the person I wanted him to be. I told him that I loved him and that I always would. I ended the email by asking him not to reply because I didn’t want to re-read his email over and over again as it would be too painful for me. He obliged. I had seen him in pas 

When my ex and I broke up in 2014, we were still in love. My mother decided she didn’t approve of our relationship, so we were forced to split at the age of 14 and I was moved to a different town. She shipped me off to my hometown in FL for the summer and turned off my phone service so that i could not have contact with said ex. I even tried mailing letters, but my aunt took them out of the mailbox and told my mother about it.

I have either accidentally or on purpose encountered all my exes several years or even several lifetimes after we parted because of reincarnation, or the ebb and flow of all living things. For example, my Husband No. 2 passed away some years ago. However, in some of my dreams or nightmares he appears as my mother. My husband No. 1 was my brother in previous lifetimes. After all the romance faded, we were siblings and/or best friends. These other examples aren’t exes, at least in this current lifetime, but my daughter has been my sister in several lifetimes. This is a very strong connection becaus 

Yes, and it was hilarious! After 5 years of dating, and 14 years of marriage, my Ex finally realized that I would not ever allow her to be in complete control, and said that she “wanted out of the marriage”. After a semi-nasty divorce that took 6 months, and another 2 months for me to find a new home, I went on my way. Since we did not have kids, it would be a clean break. (Although I did essentially raise her son from her first marriage, but that’s another story) I moved to a new home about 6 miles away. About 2 years later she showed up at my door unannounced (and most definitely uninvited) to 

Why did BTS Jungkook and IU break up in 2020?
Because IU had enough of Jungkook. Let me back it up- IU and Jungkook’s been dating since 2011 when he auditioned for Superstar K using IU’s song. IU got hold of the news that Jungkook was a fan, and she fell in love with his voice and visuals. So they started their day 1.  This is a lovey-dovey picture of Jungkook and IU 🥰 But unfortunately, they broke up in March 2020. IU was the one to make this decision. IU could see him every day because Jungkook made time to see her. But sadly, this got too overwhelming for IU. She always had heart attacks (that didn’t kill her, but still very deadly) just b 

I- Um…  They were never dating publicly so I don’t know where you got the information that they broke up… We know that Jungkook said that IU was his ideal type but that was years ago so theres no guarantee if he still feels that way. There could be a chance that they were but if they were it was never public. Please don’t start rumors about people like that so you don’t get in trouble(unless you were genuinely confused) and let Kook be a fanboy in peace.

Um okay, as a huge fan of IU since 2011 I know for a fact that there is no official or credible statement about their relationship. All we all know is that Jungkook has been a long time fan of IU. But I have never see IU reciprocate his feeling. And maybe Jungkook is just a fan. And doesn’t have a romantic interest in IU at all.

I see some rude answers here. Just say things politely. You can say “ It was actually a rumor. They didn’t date. Their company doesn’t allow it.” not “leave” , “your dumb”, “stop invading“ and etc. Sometimes it is hard for people to know the difference between fake and real news. Sometimes there is a video footage to support it. Your job is to explain them politely the difference between fake and real news.  726 views · View upvotes3Charlie C, BTS/TXT ults, casual fan of many other groupsAnswered October 8, 2020 · Author has 778 answers and 255.4K answer views

How do I maintain the peace I’ve found from ending my relationship with a narcissist?
I guess the obvious answer is to keep with the No Contact rule and never engage, speak or hear from them again in any form. That works for me. I have been contacted by my ex husband and his family etc and I just ignore them all. “What’s the point? “ is my mantra. It seems to fit the situation and stop me from doubting my convictions. Put a whole lot of distance between you and your ex and if you need to pay someone to be in between you both - do it! especially if you are divorcing. Also If I had to communicate (during the legal stuff) I would send his emails on to others to read for me and just 

Thank you for this A2A.The way to maintain peace from ending a relationship w/ a pwNPD is to come to terms with, and remember why you left in the first place.. Everyday is a new day to assert our convictions and honor ourselves with all the work it took to walk away from someone who can not love us. You realize, you were involved in a relationship w/ someone who lacks both empathy and the ability to self-regulate. Validation for a narcissist is paramount for day to day survival at any cost. We were simply used as a tool in their kit to escape their reality. The bond we felt was a one-way stre 

I will share what has helped me to maintain the peace after leaving a narcissist for the final time and not looking back. You may have peace most days, but you may still have some rough days where your heart wants to ruminate or remember something that you know you shouldn’t. -I made a decision to only follow and be led by FACTS and not FEELINGS. I broke my trauma bond by doing this, because our feelings are emotions and those will lead us to miss the narcissist, dwell on what we perceived as happy times, or even want to contact the narcissist. the FACTS are the truth of the situation and canno 

To maintain my peace of mind after ending the relationship with my narcissist here are a few different things that I tried To start with the first thing I did was read talk to others on Quora and learn about narcissism this way you can learn how to handle your current narcissist or how to spot one , how to react to one , how not to react &amp; how to make sure that you never end up with another narcissistic relationship Once informed , that going to talk to him was giving him Supply I wouldn't do it anymore before that , I was trying to get answers trying to make up . After reading about narcissism  

That's a great question! I am wondering if I should ask you that question. Even though I ended all narcissistic relationships I had about a year ago. Every blue moon something triggers me. I usually face whatever head on by looking at the situation from an objective perspective and talk myself through it. If that doesn't work I change my focus and distract myself by helping someone else like my children with homework, or volunteer to help with organizations that are close to my heart, or listen to inspiring pop music about someone overcoming all odds. I try to live in the present moment and re 

I can only tell you what's been working for me. (And one or two things that don't. ) Avoid drinking. Alcohol actually prolonged the Trauma Bond. Trauma Bond withdrawal is very painful. But it DOES go away. Keep the narcissist blocked on phone/text, social media and email. Don't creep the narcissist ‘s social media * Block every known relative of the narcissist, even if you like them. Block every mutual friend. If necessary, sever contact with any of your own family members who wont sever contact with the narcissist. I'll explain why down below** Focus on yourself, your health and self improvement. 

Unleash your inner queen or king. You need to have one Mantra in life: I am good enough, I am worthy of love. And I don’t mean Love from others. You are worthy of loving yourself. See, after a relationship with a narcissist, your identity is erased. The narcissist has structured a reality in which your whole worth depends on them. It’s psychological warfare. Now, that you are out of the fog, there are a few things you need to watch out for: cognitive dissonanceNo matter how happy you are to be free, there will be moments when you doubt yourself. Maybe they were right? Maybe I was too needy, insec 

That is excellent that you are at peace after ending your relationship with your narc ex. The key to maintaining this peace is going 💯 No Contact- meaning blocking him on all social media platforms, on your phone, on your email… EVERYWHERE! This way he won’t be able to reach you and bother you. Also I highly recommend dropping anyone that is associated with him such as any mutual friends (the ones that are likely loyal to him or the ones that will more than likely keep in touch with him) main reason for this is: you don’t want those friends letting your ex know about how you are doing so he cont

What a beautiful question. Because we really do find peace. But in my experience, the part of me that lead me to this final abusive relationship, well, I was accustomed to the chaos and the peace was actually uncomfortable. And that, I realized was part of the problem. So I reached out and asked questions and learned that I was GROOMED to need the chaos. While I knew rationally that the peace was good and healthy, I desired the chaos. But, the “chaos” can come in different forms and those can include things that are not UNHEALTHY. So I learned going to dinner with friends, laughing, dancing, trav 

If you have already found peace then keep doing what you are doing. I personally chose to disengage from the public (places we may have hung out) and social media. This helped eliminate any chance of seeing him or anyone that has anything to do with him. I reconnected with my family and a few friends that I can trust and truly know me and how I was before the relationship. It helps to have people around who can encourage you to be the strong person you were before your partner came along. Continue to educate yourself, I do still speak with an abuse counselor, read books on the topic, and I am  

Have you ever broken up with someone over a single character flaw?
I have. It was his traditional mindset about women. It wasn't something stated before, as we used to be close friends since we were kids and knew everything about each other. He's 3 years older than me. It was a dreamy relationship at the very beginning. Honestly speaking, I always felt there was something more between us and probably always used to see us together whenever I have been thinking about my future. I was deeply in love for years at that point. I am an open-minded person, I like talking a lot, traveling and trying new things. Definitely an extrovert. He seemed like this too (until we  

Once I had a great friend from highschool that turned into a girlfriend when we were in our twenties. She pretty much looked like Betty from Betty Blue.

Not a girl you would ever break up with. She thought of me as a smart guy . I was a support for her during highshool when she had a hard time being mocked by her classmates. Then I would tell her she was great and the bullies were insecure fools. When our relationship gets off a c 

Yes. My new boyfriend was soon smothering me with attention. When I first met Gary, I was newly divorced from a man that had treated me like I was just another piece of furniture in our house. I was just someone who cleaned the house and looked after our children and occasionally rode in the car with him. Gary, though, was VERY attentive from the moment we met. He actually made eye contact as we talked and got to know each other. That first night when we danced, he whispered in my ear that I was FANTASTIC! He also told me he’d like to take me to Hawaii and three months later we did go. In the  

Interesting previous response about the bad laugh haha. On a serious note, I can think of situations where I’ve broken up or sort of pseudo-consciously sabotaged relationships for reasons that pretty much came from a central character flaw. I don’t think anyone is so perfect that they only have ONE flaw and if you’re breaking up with someone you think is that great, you’re nuts, but it’s more that certain flaws grate more than others depending on your personality. For example, a lot of people are annoyed by someone who is often late, absent-minded, or messy but I sort of don’t mind this in a w 

I swear some Quora questions really bring up old, old memories! Many, many years ago, I dated a guy who seemed really nice. He was attractive, affable, a gentleman and he seemed like an all around nice guy. One day he came to my home for dinner. We had been on a few dates, but this was the first time I invited him over to my place. We sat down on my couch and proceeded to have a good time talking, laughing and joking together. Before dinner, he asked to use the bathroom and, of course, I obliged. He went into the bathroom to use it and, before he came out, I realized that I didn’t have any soap 

He was nice, but a total freeloader. So this was a time when I was single and not particularly serious about seeing anyone. One day, an ex colleague of mine asked me out and I didn’t have anything to do that evening so I said yes. We went out, the date seemed to be going fine. He was smart, funny and behaved like a true gentleman. I always pay my share of the bill whenever I go out on a date so I insisted, but he didn’t let me do it at any cost. I said okay. Because the date had gone well, I knew I will get my chance to pay him back. Post that we went out 4–5 times again, and the entire thing las 

Original question answered: Have you ever broken up with someone over a single character flaw? I dated the nicest guy for three years, starting when I was 19. Mark adored me. He gave me gifts. Told me he loved me several times an hour. Was always up for an adventure. Listened to me rattle on and on about whatever I wanted to talk about. He really listened, too, not just that listening while waiting for his turn to speak thing that lots of people do. But Mark had one horrible character flaw: he could not commit to anything. Not a single thing. He couldn’t commit to a job. In the three years we wer 

My wife’s lack of empathy. It wasn’t always this way (I don’t think). In fact, the closer we got to our wedding, the more I noticed it. She is a good person though, she isn’t mean nor does she wish harm on others. She just has a hard time, or spends no time at all in someone else’s shoes. Lacking empathy lead to her lack of boundaries, dishonesty and manipulative behavior. All of which weren’t laced with anything purposefully antagonistic. A few examples: I do photography as a hobby, and was planning to shoot a coworkers birthday party. I asked my wife if there was any way that she could take me in h

She was messy. She always had an excuse as to why she doesn't clean up. Poor hygiene is a huge turn off for me. We were going out for a month, she asked if she could stay in my place for the time being. She was looking for a new flat, I agreed and welcomed her to my place. She seemed neat and tidy when we were going out, but it all changed when she moved in with me. Her dirty panties were all over the bathroom. Her brassiers were all over the room, and were hardly washed. Probably the reasons why she didn't let me in her flat because she doesn't clean. I can never sleep with someone who practice 

I didn't realise the flaw for what it was at the time, since it stressed me out to the point of near constant panic attacks. I left because I couldn't deal with the stress anymore. I like helping people. I go above and beyond to do things for others. So when I met him, with all his problems, I thought I could help. This lead to a relationship a few weeks later. Thing is, for every problem of his I fixed, there were another three in tow. It was a never-ending list of constant, life-and-death problems. His ex was holding all his possessions hostage interstate.He had no job because the boss was prej

Go and speak to someone - tell a friend what’s been going on, speak to a therapist; come clean and let them know exactly what happened in the relationship from start to finish. Don’t try to over analyse, it can lead to analysis paralysis, it can plug up the emotions you need to feel and plough through to process what’s happened.Be selective - relationships with narcissists feature them drilling to you a reflection of worthlessness, they take and they abuse, they tell you your worth nothing and hit below the belt. This comes from a person you once loved. You’ll be hurt and low in self esteem, t

Why do breakups happen even after being together for years?
Oh, people split up for all kinds of reasons—most of these are not the kind of answer you’re looking for tho: cheating, lying, abuse, addiction… etc. I’m guessing you want to know why two people who love each other and have an otherwise functional relationship end up going their separate ways. Let me tell you a bit about my story. Approximately one year ago I ended a long (nearly 10 year) relationship with a man I loved (and still love) deeply. We had gotten together during the endings of our respective marriages and had a two year courtship; getting to know one another and falling deeply in lo 

In a lot of cases, it’s specifically BECAUSE the people involved have been together for so many years. Almost every one of the cases I’ve seen where long-term couples break up follows the same progression of events from the moment they meet until the bitter end, and it all has to do with an increasingly intolerable familiarity with one another. I think Chris Rock put it best when he said that when you first meet someone, you’re not really meeting THEM, you’re meeting their representative. The reason for this is obvious: when you first meet someone you’re interested in, you want to impress them  

Falling in love is a mix of luck (meeting this one spiritual match that could have been a continent away but just happens to be on your bus, then having the chance to spend enough time to realize you have a connection) and something like magic (good or bad?). The process of being in love creates endorphins that quite literally drug you into loving that person more than you ever thought was possible. Even if you’re aware of the fact that you’re under the influence of one of the most powerful mind altering drugs ever known, you can’t decipher where the “real” person ends and the drug induced awe

Because unconditional love is dead. In fact, it never existed in the first place.

One of my favorite rides on the playground as a child and what would later become a metaphor to describe the world how I looked at life being in love with someone I care about deeply. My girlfriend and I have been together for 11 years now. Since we were 15 and in high school. We just clicked.

You need to understand the cycle of the sweet drama you call as a Love Affair. You most certainly were doing good if not great before you even met them. Once you started getting closer your mind made up all kinds of reasons to make you believe there is a huge void in your life and this is the person who fits in perfectly. You put in all efforts to make them happy keeping yourself secondary. At first instance you were attracted to their looks, voice, intellect, etc and did not stop to think about your compatibility with each other before pursuing a serious relationship. All you wanted was to som 

There's just one simple reason. People change. They don't remain the same always and therefore, you can't expect their affection towards you to stay the same. I fell in love when we were in class 8th and proposed to her the next year. We were best friends and after a lot of effort and persuasion from my side, we ultimately got into a relationship. Life was just as good as it can get. We were among the toppers of the class and had a lot of fun together. But we were totally opposite. She was an extrovert and loved to socialise while I being an introvert. It caused a lot of problems but we managed  

What do you do when you want your ex back badly and you still love them deeply but they are already in a “rebound” only after a month of dumping you?
Does a narcissist feel bad and realize what they lost after a breakup?
It’s likely in the initial stages after the break up that they do not feel bad. They have built up a whole narrative as to why you were at fault for the relationship failing. They have told all of their flying monkeys for a long time how this relationship just isn’t working for them because of you. They have used you and your increasingly desperate behaviors to triangulate new supply. In fact, most all of your increasingly desperate behaviors were created by them to get a reaction and use the silent treatment and go off and chase new supply. They have idealized the person who will be replacing

That was until she fully pulled away a few months ago and met someone else and my world literally came crashing down. All i can say at this stage is the last year was like a dream, i wasn't really familar with my actions and didnt question the hurt i've been causing. Bu 

Thanks for the A2A. Let me lead off with the same version of disclaimer that I post at the beginning of every question that I get asked about people with NPD…there is no one size fits all. Every person that suffers from NPD is different just like we are all different even if we do not have a personality disorder. That being said there are some general characteristics that all NPD sufferers share. Lack of whole object relations and object constancy, low/non-existent empathy, issues with identity and feelings of shame. Pretty much all people with NPD exhibit these characteristics because they are 

I have remained largely silent on the topic of narcissism, because it’s a tender point with me. In counseling, I discovered (from my therapist) that the person I had once trusted implicitly was more than likely a covert narcissist, which is why I wasn’t able to peg him straight away. They present as nice and normal. At the least, he had exhibited many traits of a covert narcissist. His actions and statements toward the end were not normal, that much I knew. One trait that I believe makes neurotypicals different from narcissistic personality types is that we feel genuinely feel bad when we are re 

I think that I spent the first 6 years of the “marriage” (which was annulled) expecting the narcissist eventually would love me even a little and treat me decently; as I proved I would do practically anything for him. Everything I did served him. He was a 36 yr old college professor, (never married) and I was just 18. I was a promising student, early entry; Yet I quit college three months after the marriage to support his effort toward his PhD; and took a minimum wage job. We lived in a creepy rusted out trailer in the woods. This I hoped proved my commitment devotion as a wife. But it never e 

They feel bad about the object that they have lost an old wounded t shirt,why should they feel bad lol? I mean you got manipulated since day 1 and fooled that he/she loved you respected you and valued you,they ain’t able to love anyone they have shallow Empathy almost none of it,they might miss the things you provided to them which is Narcissistic Supplies(Any form of emotional validation,importance validation,money,sex etc etc)Do you really think a person that breaks up with you really gave you his/her Empathy?That makes no sense to me,he might have even discarded you like an Object,you are a  

No, they do not feel bad and they never realize what they lost - because - they never knew what they had to begin with it. If they did they would not have destroyed the relationship. Healthy people might realize a mistake and take actions to correct them, but keep your exception set to zero with a narcissist. Narcissist have very little insight and next to no ability to reflect, never mind contain any feelings of guilt, shame, remorse or regret. If any feeling like this arises it will be directed outward as ‘blame’. “You” are responsible for the breakup, the relationship was ‘bad anyway’, it’s  

One of the things that is a little shocking about NPD is how quickly the past becomes “just a story” for the NPD. They can tell you a story about something that happened to them, making it sound like it happened weeks or even months ago… and later you find out it happened yesterday. They are mentally removed from “the past” and all about right now. While sometimes that is simply manipulation or lying, it happens so often that you realize in their mind, it really is a distant thing. If you aren’t standing in front of them, you don’t really exist. They don’t miss things they’ve tossed in the garbag 

After 9 years, my ex barely knew me. I kept the real me hidden away because I never trusted him, nor did I believe he would accept me as I am. I was two people, one for him and his world and one for work and my friends. They were different. One was little goodie two shoes, polite and demure. The other was a hell raiser. I suspect I’m not the only person who had to behave a certain way, to have my own persona, if you will, while in the presence. The problem with not being able to integrate the full spectrum of your personality is that when required to be perfect the less than perfect things start 

A narcissist never had anything, in the sense I am inferring you are thinking of it. Narcissists have been emotionally abused/traumatized/neglected at a very young age, causing their emotional maturity to be stunted at the age of the trauma. They are unable to experience mature emotions such as gratitude, remorse, empathy, or disinterested love. We use ourselves as barometers to judge the experiences of others. So we think narcissists experience relationships as we do, but they don't. Narcissists are solipsistic; they never developed the ability to detach themselves from others, or perceive othe 

Can you really find love again after you broke up with someone who you thought was “the one”?
How do I overcome severe depression caused by heartbreak?
There is a reason for everything that happens to us. And there will always be a lesson for us to learn from it. I do understand how the feeling break up takes to that feeling if void in heart. And its a shitty feeling. I always feel every one has to go through such a phase, coz this phase after break actu teaches us a lot of lessons of life. What has happened has happened. Whats happening now is upto the decisions you make.

Be assured I have walked your path. Twice actually. The first time I lost weight. The second time years later, I was clinically depressed. I look back now and thank God for the breakup! That won’t help at the present. Will offer some suggestions I give to anyone facing depression regardless the cause. These may require a little change on your part, which might be what you need. You can also use countless non-chemical means to cope with depression/stress. Some, and this is a short list, are: Get up 15 minutes earlierPrepare for the morning the night beforeAvoid tight fitting clothesAvoid relying 

If you've suffered for a certain amount of months (lets say, 6, to give a number), it may just be grief. You may still cry if you hear that song you heard with that person, or your heart may wrinkle like a raisin when you walk into that person accidentally. But it's natural. Its a loss. However, if it has run for longer time, or even if you want to cope with it in a better way, you can follow some tips:1) Step back to basics. I do not know if you are a perfectly healthy person or if you are homeless, but I assume that if you have access to internet and you are worrying about your mental stat 

Heartbreak ! A horrible nightmare it is. HEARTREAK This causes depression because when its about our loved ones, we start analyzing the things with our heart rather than our mind. Its a constant fight between our heart and our mind. Somewhere deep down, you too knew things will not fall in place, but might be that was difficult to accept. In this fight between out heart and our mind, our mind - is ourselves, our logic and perhaps our heart is him/her we loved a lot and that has evolved as our weakness. In this constant fight between heart and mind, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE WIN AGAINST OUR WEAKNESS 

I have been there and these things helped me. If you are feeling really depressed, first try the following. If your feelings last for several weeks or longer, please seek a therapist and possibly meds to help. But I hope these help. Give them a try. Screaming Aloud. (Make sure you are somewhere that this will not get other people alarmed). Stand up, spread your arms wide, and yell at the top of your lungs what an ASSHAT he is!!! Scream it out, yell it out, say all the horrible things he is. What a release! And standing in a spread eagle really opens up your chest and heart and lungs. You will fee

I know i can answer this . Noone can explain depression unless he has been through it . It's just not only sadness . It's something else . You know people don't take it seriously . Someone asked me “ Why are you depressed ? Look at how great your life is !” You know it's just like asking “ what do you mean you have asthma ? Look at all the air .’ Heartbreaks cause a hell lot of depression . It's just you and the walls . Emotional attachments just don't fade away . People will tell you to be strong and stop feeling such and such … to give it time . Will tell you tons of things like it would all he 

It’s tough but it’s possible. First thing first, end all communication with her.Don’t stalk her on any social media. I suggest you to quit social media. Tell your problem to someone who care really for you. He/she can be a parent or friend . Try to go out with someone,it may be a friend or group of friends. Enjoy with them and don’t tell about your problem to each and everyone you meet. In the morning make a routine to meditate. In the beginning it will be tough but stick to it. Running is also good. It has been found in a study that running and meditation can help us to cure depression. You ca 

When we commit in a relationship, in the back of our minds, there’s always a wish and hope that we end up marrying; otherwise, there is no commitment, right? But every time, there is no happy ending. People in the middle of their relationships realize that they can’t live together that doesn’t mean that they are stupid but it means that they are courageous. Being in a relationship is a different feeling altogether, there is trust, love, respect and honesty. Two people forget the world around them and commit to each other. But when any of the thing mentioned above lacks, the bond starts to shake,

First you analyse why you became depressed? The probable reasons will be after break up the memories either sweet or sour will be haunting you. The more you are haunted by those memories the more depressed you will be.

How can I tell if my girlfriend really loves me?
Girls can be quite expressive and obvious. When a woman loves you, she will dive into your world and make you her world. She will try to know everything about your world, mix up in your world. Your family will interest her more than her own family.She will take efforts for you, she will do lots of stuff for you. She will make you feel special. She will try to know what bothers you and cover up for it. She will try and understand you more, your preferences and tastes, and surprise you more often than that.She would care for you and advise you like you are her baby. Well, it's inherently there in

Actions and emotions are always in tune. If a girl truly loves you, her actions will be in tune with it. Never judge a girl by her words, the truth always lies in her actions. Most guys find girls confusing because girls usually don’t follow up on what they seem to be saying. The thumb rule to follow with girls is to base your judgments on their actions, rather than their words. Just because a girl tells you that she loves you, does not mean that she really feels love for you deep down. Girls are usually not very decided about what they want so they just follow their intuition unconsciously. That 

You don't.  Even though texting is now a huge part of how we convey information with each other, it misses out on a very crucial part of human communication: body language or nonverbal communication.   When we talk to one another in person, the majority of the way we communicate does not involve words!  With an emotion like love, how your girlfriend interacts with you in a physical space is a much more important indicator of how she feels about you than what she says in text messages.  She might say, "I love you SOOO much! &lt;3 &lt;3" in a text message, but when you're together, for example, she mai 

I think the question here is why are you questioning that she does? Is is because you’re hearing warning bells about her behaviour or is it because you really can’t see why she loves you? If its the first, one of the hardest lessons I learned and one of the wisest is, if you hear warning bells, listen to them, as long as they are genuine warning bells and not bells of your own making. Humans have a remarkable ability to self sabotage, due to our own lack of belief in ourselves and sometimes we can start reading signs and portents into things because we’re so afraid of losing someone and we end u

There various ways to know if your girlfriend loves you or not... 1. If your girlfriend loves you, she will be anxious to please you.2. If she loves you, she will be eager to see you all the time.3. If your girlfriend loves you, she will not expect you to be the only one who calls her more frequently. If your girlfriend hardly call you with the excuse that she doesn't have call credit all the time, then re-evaluate your relationship again!4. If she loves you, she will trust you unconditionally - even when she sees you in the company of other girls. She will not just jump to hasty conclusions 

Well this is interesting. Just understand this, if she really loves you, the first thing is that you will start doubting yourself whether you deserve her or not. And besides “ I love you”, she'll do things unconditionally. If you are really confused, you can look for signs. Tell her you're down with fever and you will find that the only person who is as worried as your mom and sister is your girl. Those hourly calls asking how you feel, have you eaten something, say it all.Tell her to wake you up at an odd hour. Let's say 4am. Trust me, it doesn't matter when she sleeps. She will get up at 3:30

Women are unpredictable beings. They are emotional and they change their minds easily. They can be impulsive and surprising. They can easily fall in love, and later on have a change of heart. This is one of the causes of men’s heartbreaks. However, when a woman matures and experiences true love, she can be so selfless that she becomes so vulnerable. She would not let emotions sway her from side to side. She will be faithful to you. 1. She takes care of you like a mom. You would know how much your girlfriend loves you based on how she takes care of you. Her mother instinct makes her do everythin 

I’d been someone’s girlfriend for 4 years, so I think I can answer this question based on my experience in a serious relationship. You’ll know if your girlfriend really loves you when: She cares for you more than you would even care for yourself; she’ll even encourage you to take supplements and share with you her own vitamins/supplements that she thinks are really good for the health.She can’t wait to tell you stories about her day; she will text/chat you throughout the day even if you don’t reply right away. (Girls are better multi-taskers than boys; it’s a fact)She’ll ask you how’s your day, 

Oh my; this is a question I struggle with myself. We all want to be loved the way we want to be loved. And all of us have different love languages, and different styles and different measurements. So; I can get right down and tell you that it's how she makes you feel loved. But that's not accurate enough because sometimes you can't just base your answer on how you "feel" loved (maybe you cannot "see" or comprehend the level of love she has for you). Since different people show love in their own unique way; let's explore further. I suggest you to take a pen and paper and sit yourself down and try y 

My girlfriend is mad at me for "not standing up for her.” She accidentally spilled her drink on a girl in the club. The other girl threw her drink on my girlfriend and her boyfriend shoved me. I grabbed my girlfriend and we left. What should I do?
Yeah, she has every right to be mad at you. Because only a real man will start a fight with drunk, possibly high,  aggressive  strangers with hair trigger tempers  in a charged, highly public atmosphere like a club where everyone there is preening in one way or another, rather than walk away in shame unscathed from the crazy.  &lt;sarcasm off&gt; Your girlfriend sounds like an immature dumbass who thinks that only real men worthy of her attention are aching to get into fights  every time someone does something she doesn't like. That little girl has to realize this isn't the Knights of the Round Table he 

Some time ago a friend of mine was drinking in a bar with his wife when she accidentally did the same as OPs girlfriend and spilled some drink on another girl. The girl she spilled the drink on went crazy and just like in OPs story the boyfriend appeared to see what was happening.  My friend says his biggest mistake was not to just turn and leave immediately,instead he stepped between the boyfriend and his wife to try to de-escalate things. While he was talking to the boyfriend (who it turns out was pretty chill) the crazy girlfriend smashed a glass in his wifes face.   The boyfriend dragged the 

Wow, I'm sorry this happened to you both. What an unfortunate accident that turned into violence and hate toward you and your girlfriend. That just stinks. Look, there was nothing you could have done in that situation. You had to diffuse the anger, and get the heck out. It most certainly could have escalated.  What I'm interested in knowing is how you handled things after you left?  Let me let you in on a little secret. Women still want to be protected by their boyfriends/husbands. It is deeply ingrained in us. If nothing can be done during an escalated situation (which clearly here was the case) 

I am sure you must have heard of the line “Humans are social animals”. The key word here is ANIMAL, we are all biologically programmed in such a way that the male of our species will majorly if not always have the urge to physically support our female counterparts at times of conflicts Let me give a small story from the time i was dating around a decade or so ago, so me and my girl had this thing that we used to have daily dinner after work at the same restaurant which was mid way to both our work places, we didn’t go there for any particular food or beverage but just for convenience. This was  

Of course you made the smart and gentlemanly move. Absolve thyself of all guilt now.  Listen, kid, had you and your woman confronted the aggressors, you both could have ended up badly beaten, damaged physically and financially, ashamed and in jail -- and for what? It's not like you were defending your nation against the friggin' Germans? Engaging in a pointless fight with some drunken nightclub knucklehead trash is not worth any outcomes, even total victory. That only makes you an equally large idiot.  And by the way, your girl sounds like a big, immature baby. If any girl asked me to fight for  

You should leave that girlfriend. What your girlfriend needed to do was to apologize profusely to the couple and ask if there was anything she could do to make up. And you needed to do that too. I don’t know, maybe you did the right thing. But she definitely has a character problem. But it is a sad shame that the immaturity of the couple played out the way it did, and even sadder that your girlfriend is upset with you. Her emotionalism unfortunately betrays her character. She should be upset with herself for causing the whole thing, not with you. I would leave her. Sooner or later she will get  

There are a lot of good answers here. I took a few months of martial arts instruction a few years ago. The instructor was like a slightly smaller version of Shaq. The man could definitely fight. He could have killed me in five minutes with one hand. He said, "It's always better to walk away than fight. You fight only as a last resort, to keep from being killed or maimed." He said that when he lived in Amsterdam, he had returned to his apartment one day to find an intruder in the act of stealing his TV. He said "Hey, so what's up?" Rather than try to demonstrate his fighting skills on the guy, he 

Tell her that brawling with strangers in bars is an excellent way to wind up dead or terribly, life-alteringly injured, whereas apologizing profusely and leaving as soon as humanly possible is the best strategy for continuing to live without injury, criminal charges, or getting sued by anyone for whatever you messed up or broke as you were being mauled by the drunk, violent thug she wanted you to "stick up for her" to.   **Most bar brawls involve either knives or blunt instruments.** They very rarely involve only bare fists, common sense, or fair play.

Learn Martial Arts, and tell her, that the best weapon, is walk away. Even if you had a gun, the best thing is to walk away. You can be the best fighter treatened by the weakest fighter, just walk away. You did what you should do. Martial artists never fight, do you ever see them fighting? ever? on yt anywhere on street? no, they escalate the situation with words. They are confident enough to stand up for them self, and you wont intimidate them by shouting or looking at thier eyes, but they will handle it calm staying strong. Even if the martial artists could knock the other oponent out, he ju 

You did the right thing. The question is why doesn't your girlfriend understand that, and what, if anything, can you do about it. I can only speculate as to why your girlfriend doesn't understand. Perhaps she's seen too many Sylvester Stallone movies. But clearly she thinks that her honor was at stake, and her honor was more important than getting out alive. Honor of that sort is an expensive concept. A lot of people have died or been hurt in pursuit of honor. And for what? So that other people will admire them?  The problem is that most people don't respect that kind of honor any more. Most peop 

Can a shy guy get a girlfriend if he's good looking? Can good looks substitute for an introverted personality in dating?
 I am a good looking man and I can tell you, it didn’t make a damn difference in the past. I never had a girlfriend, or sex until I was 24 years old. This was when I started working as a kitchen chef, and my job forced me to become more outgoing. I wouldn’t say it was in the kindest ways. I was verbally spanked by my superiors every single day. Often I felt like crying in the kitchen. It was terrible. But I thank myself for that experience because it certainly made me a better man. Yes, I won’t deny looks will definitely help you initially. But they may help and in some cases also not help you at  

Yes, of course you can.In my opinion nobody is boring. Some people just don't understand other people and can't relate to them.Also, at the start of a relationship, looks are the most important thing. However, whilst dating continues you have to interest the girl and the conversation must flow for the relationship to work. First I'll tell you about me:Some people may consider me boring and quiet but that's because they don't understand me as we have very different personalities and I don't let them into my life. I once thought I was socially awkward. Even now, I don't have any good friends w 

Great questions. I can definitely relate to this. Look buddy, I was a shy introverted nice guy and if you are like this you will finish last. You will be the friend zone guy and never the boyfriend and if you do get into a relationship you will be miserable. Trust me. You can try to play the cool guy facade and even get a girl from time to time but it’ll all eventually crumble because your “personality,” will fuck you over. Yes a guy can get a GF if he’s shy and/or good looking. But why in the hell would you want to supplicate and replace you’re core self with external validation. Looks can ma 

You're only going to be predictable for those who know you, and nobody's going to be able to get to know you if you can't be open with anyone (they're probably not going to hear your intelligent WWII humour either).  But, I'm willing to guess that there are some people you feel comfortable with that you've known for a long time and can relax with. Maybe make it a goal to challenge yourself and see if you can be good friends with a person who happens to be female.  Starting off by approaching females, not as potential girlfriends, but as potential platonic friends is a great first step to take.  T 

CLIFF NOTES VERSION: For women, yes. Good looks can compensate and they often have leeway (IF they choose the right type of guys) when it comes to oddness or lack of social skills. For men, well… you're creepy, awkward, weird, maybe even considered “stalker,” etc. or any other labels / terms out there that may exist. You do not have much room for error if you're a calm, respectful, kind and sensitive male trying to attract western women. Unfortunately, when you're shy, you typically tend to have less friends and influences around, so your natural “nice guy” personality tends to display automatical 

Why exactly can't you work on your social skills? If they're such a tremendous weakness of yours, they seem like the things you should be devoting the most attention to. If you ask 100 women what is the most attractive quality a guy can have, the most common answer you'll get is confidence, not good looks. You know what confidence is? Being comfortable in situations where you're vulnerable. You achieve this by putting yourself in situations where you're vulnerable over and over again and living through them. It sounds like working on your social skills will make you very vulnerable, and if you  

I think you've already shot yourself in the foot, because for some reason you believe you can't work on social skills. Social skills are skills (it says so right on the tin). Skills are learned. You absolutely can improve your social skills. It sounds like you simply don't want to, for whatever reason. Working on the other stuff won't help very much. It is far easier for an unattractive guy with good social skills to get a partner than it is for an absolute junk with poor social skills, because relationships are, by their nature, social sctivities. So, to answer your question: Can a shy, awkward 

"If he's looking or even if he is not looking", yes, an awkward guy can have a girlfriend - there is no need to build muscle, lose weight, or everything that you have listed here.  It seems like you are thinking in a way of filling a checklist, and targets to achieve, like it is a video-game. Take a few steps back ... to get a girlfriend, you have to meet other people, interact with them - then the magic happens, it is very simple.  Having a mind already set on wanting a girlfriend might be a little confusing though, because girls can sense this overall "pressure" coming from you. My advice at t 

Congratulations on being good looking! I think your looks can do about 1/3 to 1/2 of it. I am about a 6 (1–10) and have often felt the only reason people kept inviting me back to their room or saying Hi was because of something about the way I looked. Perhaps it was long hair. Anyway, if it gives you dating confidence, and there is support for it being true, which there is, I think you could use it to contribute to your sense of optimism about dating. Also, think about how seeing beautiful women gives a lift to your mood! It is possible women and gay men feel a similar lift when they see you, so 

From a female perspective, you can be confident even if you're shy. I'm pretty shy myself but that doesn't mean I'm not confident in who I am. I'm shy and I know it. You just have to own it. I suspect that it isn't your shyness that is deterring women (I think shy guys are the cutest), it's that you lack confidence in yourself. Shy does not necessarily mean awkward. Introvert does not necessarily mean shy.  It is also possible that you are going after the wrong kind of woman. The "popular, pretty, and social" girls most likely have nothing in common with you. They want to be seen and to go out

Okay really think about this one. What are you attempting to achieve by dumping her? Are you going to wait around until you find a girl that doesn’t sh!t? I find many things my boyfriend does completely disgusting. I find many things HUMANS do completely disgusting. But you appear too young or too immature to be in an actual relationship with an actual human. This hyper sexualisation and expectation of women to be perfect is getting insanely ridiculous. My advice however is yes, dump her. Let her leave and find a man that is okay with dating a living breathing human, who will accept her, and won’t  

Once upon a time classical statues had two things: male statues had a fig leaf to hide the penis, something you don’t normally get growing on you in nature. Female statues, conversely, didn’t have something you do get in nature: pubic hair. That's how statues were, all of them. And that’s what one young man expected on his wedding night: a woman who looked like a statue, because, well, statues. He was so disgusted at pubic hair on a woman that he never went anywhere near her again. Now, you and I might reasonably guess that there was something else going on here and this pubic hair thing was a de

Women are humans and they have natural bodily functions as well. You do realise that is why people women have an ass, it is also men have an ass, to eliminate bodily waste.

Of course you should! Girls don’t poop. Duh. Well, real girls with self-respect and respect for others don’t. The only women who actually do poop are obese women with at least shades of facial hair. So your Aunt Martha may, and that one large, unattractive woman in the office or classroom may — and don’t hold it against them nor find them any more unattractive due to that — but you’re not going to want to be around her in day to day life usually, to find out. So if your girlfriend pooped — whether you saw it in the toilet or not — that’s not a good sign of a true, respectable lady. Just let her 

Yes, you should definitely dump her. She deserves better than someone who apparently doesn’t think women are real people. So do her a favour and break up now to save her a lot of pain. I can’t imagine what would happen in the future if she got seriously ill or heaven forbid, had a baby. You can then get yourself a girfriend without any inconvenient biological functions.

Sorry to break it to you but women and men alike poop, fart, burp, and vomit etc. and there should be no issue with it.

But finding her disgusting and to even ask others especially strangers if you should leave her is just ridiculous, What happens if she gets nauseous and throws up or accidentally piss’s her pants or gets a cut and bleeds are you gonna ask the people around you if you should dump her?

You’re killing me with this question. I’m going to assume she forgot to flush the toilet or that she did flush but didn’t check to make sure the toilet is clean thereafter. Some people do that and I think it’s so gross. I always check to make sure the toilet is clean after doing whatever business I was doing there. So I understand you being disgusted, poop is super gross, so gross that I close my eyes when I flush my toilet for the first time so I don’t have to see it. But sadly, humans, including you, do poop, it is what it is. With that said, dump her if it makes you feel better but don’t ge

How did you tell your parents about your girlfriend/boyfriend?
I got commited with this girl on 21st Jan, 2014. I will start telling in a bit summarized way actually. So here I go. She was my tutionmate in 12th standard , we were a part of chemistry class. At that time , I used to stare and gaze her sometimes. She was beautiful and one cannot take eyes off after seeing her. Attractive she was. But at that time I had no guts to tell her about what I feel , I was shy. This happened in 2011. Fast forward to 2013. On 11th March, I was celebrating my birthday and was going through the facebook news feed , I was checking facebook for most of the day because of th

At the beginning it was just normal stuff and then we decided to meet and then the number of meetings increased. Luckily, his office is just 2 blocks away from my house.

What are the types of people that you should always avoid?
Avoid is probably not enough. I was once in my apartment which I was renting with my girlfriend some 10 years ago. She invited one of her girl friends over to our place to see each other and have a cup of tea. She showed up with her boyfriend. It was September, they had just returned from their vacations in Asia. They hadn’t seen each other for months and they were eager to show each other all the cool stuff they had been experiencing. Our vacations were not that exotic as theirs but quite interesting through the Balkans, where my girlfriend got to meet my parents and family. Being from a Norther 

I understand that my answer will probably affect more who lives abroad than who doesn’t and has not interest in leaving his/her own country, but in my fairly long experience away from my own country, what I really came to avoid is people that moved to a country and keeps complaining about everything and everyone there, and constantly talking about how much he/she misses home, and how “things are better there”.For example, I lived in London for a few years, and was sick and tired of talking with Italians (I am Italian, I guess the name tells it) that, holding their slice of pizza take-away bou

Here are the 10 types of people, among other, I try to avoid: 1. The “Askhole” The Askhole is the person who asks for your advice, tells you how wise and helpful it is, thanks you for it, does the exact opposite of what you advised, asks again for your advice on the same problem, and repeats this cycle to leave you eventually feeling like that pair of jeans which has seen one wash too many. 2. The I-me-I This is the person who talks about one thing and one thing only: himself. The I-me-I will leave you bone-tired - physically and mentally - with his incessant talking and almost unendurable, detail 

People who have a negative opinion about an entire demographic but tell you you're "different," or "one of the good ones," so you can be pals. You'll see people who are racist, or sexist, or hate an entire religion or nationality, but then "make an exception" for the few examples of people they happen to know. These people are ignorant and bigots. Don't be friends with them because they happen to like you. People who are perpetually self-destructive but will not acknowledge how their choices damage their lives. I'm not saying you should shun anyone with bad habits. We all have them to some deg

While not nearly as severe as some of the groups of people that were presented here, I’d like to propose the complete avoidance of those people that completely change depending on who they’re in a relationship with.

People that heavily trash talk their exes. Instant red flag. You loved them once. Give your past relationships respect and move on.People that “one up” all of your stories and achievements.

They may also treat you as a certain kind of competitor, wanting the same things as you, or developing the same hobbies as you, and want to surpass you.And if they can’t be better than you, they will find ways to destroy your happiness.

Does anyone want to write their heart out here?
I’ve been thinking about death for so long. I know people see it as “the weak” or “easy” way out, but there’s nothing easy about that. For eleven years I haven’t felt true happiness. I’ve tried pills and therapy, and nothing. I’m still really young, not even old enough to drink (US). I want to be happy, and I want to be at peace. I think if I were to kill myself I’d stop being so damn sad, and my friends can finally stop worrying. It’s a choice I’m making, and I don’t see the reason why I should be stopped. Should someone who’s not themselves be stopped from being happy? It’s like having somethin 

I got stoned this afternoon for the first time in 36 years. I used to smoke casually on weekends with friends, but I didn’t want to drag gunk into my lungs now that I’m older. I went with an edible and stupidly ate a little too much. It hit my like a bomb, edging close to be hallucinatory. Not quite there, but then again I’ve never hallucinated so I’m just guessing .It was kind of a scary experience for awhile until it all started to smooth out. Next time, maybe in a few weeks, I’ll eat a LOT less. 3.7K views · View upvotes5Sponsored by Capital Com SV Investments LimitedLooking for a trading platform recognised by investors?AI-powered analysis of trading performance.

How are you different from your spouse/life partner?
What is it that nobody tells you about having children?
That you will be chained to your house and unable to leave without a gigantic hassle each and every time. And if you have multiple young children (twins or close in age) it will not be twice as hard, but exponentially more hard, to do anything. That you should understand that you are now a prisoner who is dependent on the willingness or ability of others to help you escape your prison, even if it is for a little while. If not, then you have to bring them with your EVERYWHERE. You can't run out to the store for eggs or milk because you forgot them. No, it doesn't work this way. First everyone h 

Since I was told little or nothing about having kids, this question, for me, is a wide-open field. Here are the thoughts I find most helpful: 1. Good parenting is both the simplest thing in the world and the hardest thing in the world. 2. It is the simplest thing because there is one cardinal rule: whatever behavior or character trait you want your kids to display, you must model for them. If you want them to read instead of just mindlessly turning on the tube, let them see you doing that. If you want them to show restraint, let them see you giving a calm and civil answer to an impudent customer 

No one tells you anything truthful about having children. Seriously. I don't know why we keep it all to ourselves. I mean, we tell others the good stuff. How sweet new babies are. How much we learn about love. We tell expecting parents how exciting it is to watch your child grow, how amazingly wonderful it feels when they lay their sweet little heads on your shoulder. When they say ‘I love you’ to you in their tiny toddler voices. Hearing those words really is a rush of pure goodness. And having kids is truly one of my greatest joys. It won't sound like it for a minute- but hear me out. For some  

Everybody generically tells you about having kids “it's hard, but it's SOOOOO worth it.” Ok, but that's not helpful. And most of these people are too far removed from the early transition of going from no kids, to kids, that their advice lacks a memory of the difficult days. So, here's what I wish someone did tell me: You will be sleep deprived in a way you never have been before. This may include consecutive sleepless nights. And sleep deprivation brings out the worst in everyone, including your spouse, and you. You will be irrationalLabor may not go as planned. Birth classes will empower you to

For me, it was the incredible toll it takes on your relationship. I’d like to preface that this is not everyone’s experience and I never for a minute regret my children, I love them dearly and cherish my time with them. So with that all said lets begin! My then girlfriend and I met when we were 16 and just instantly clicked. We had everything in common, we had a very similar sense of humour and we loved doing everything together, conquering life together and just being in that first love bliss that didn’t change at all for over 8 years, we had ups and downs but at the end of the day we had each 

A lot of incredible responses here (I've read them all as of right now). No need to repeat them although kudos especially to Jacob VanWagoner (that PHD comic is right on target), Mira Zaslove, Janice Schwarz, Rab Letham and Jason Silverstein's answers below, among the many other great ones here. My first (currently only) child is now 2.5 months old, so it's still early, but with that disclaimer safely out of the way I'll happily share my current experience: 1. Nobody tells you what it will be that will hit you the hardest in those early first weeks because everybody's "hardest" is different. We 

They don’t tell you, when the labor ends, and the last supportive words of encouragement have finally resulted in the birth of your child…as you lay there out of breath, sweat laddened hair plastered to your face, the beating of your heart so loud in your ears, will gradually begin muting everything else. No beeping heart monitor, no cheerful exclamations, because without realizing it, until you hear him take his first gasping breath of life, you’ve been holding yours. Now the ooohs and awwws of family and nurses play distantly in the background because all you’ll hear is the sound of his cry. 

I have 8 children - 4 girls and 4 boys - and yes, they are all mine.  Once this round of rather close birthdays completes, they will be 26, 22, 20, 18, 16, 14, 5, and 3. also have 3 grandchildren, so I have been doing this for over half of my life, and I have heard most things by now.  In fact I have probably heard both sides of most things.  But I will share a couple that I don't believe I have heard anyone else say. First, no one told me about the strong thread of animosity that exists towards people (and most especially mothers) of many.  Having a big family is challenging and demanding but  

I've read through so many of these answers and I'll tell you the answers to what no one told me. I fully expected it to be hard. I think most people do, just don't expect it will be as hard as it ended up being for them. I deal with severe chronic pain and I never thought being a mom was possible. So hard was what I prepared for. I also expected the fear of something bad happening. That fear can wake you up in the night and fill you horrible images that you never wanted to imagine. I knew bad things could and do happen. I also knew that we remain eternally optimistic that we will be spared that 

I don't know if my observation is true for women, but I'm pretty sure that it is for most men. We men like dramatic situations that allows us to be heroes. We want to prove our love for our children in a single dramatic incident, which in turn also gives us the opportunity for a great story. "Remember that time where that drunk driver almost hit our daughter and I hauled his ass out of the car and held him down while you called the police? That was awesome!" Or perhaps it could be a conflict with another parent who has a child that bullies my child or pretty much whichever circumstances that allo 

What's an unpopular opinion you have about relationships?
I wouldn’t say that my opinions on relationships are “unpopular” as such, but perhaps I have some opinions that would be less favourable to some people if they were in that situation. One of them that I have is that a vast amount of people are not actually “in love” with their partner. They are simply in love with the idea of being in love or the idea they have of their partner and not the reality. I believe that there is a big difference between being in love with a person and an idea. The idea that some people have in their head is this idealised version of a the relationship that they think t 

Society should be structured for teenagers to marry. There. That got your attention. First off, I need to clarify a few things because some of you are already jumping to the wrong conclusions. For the first part, when I say, “teenagers”, I don’t mean 13 year-olds. I mean 18 years. If you can fight and die for your country or elect the future leaders of it, you should be considered mature enough to enter into lifelong arrangements with a consenting partner of equal standing. Society allows it, but it isn’t structured for those kinds of marriages to be successful. Second, my definition of marriage p 

The vast majority of relationships are based on low self confidence and manipulations. When a person is born he`s given a figurative book of rules that he must obey. This book is written mainly by society to create some kind of order. The problem is that people who are both emotionally and psychologically immature due to their young age , receive blocks of information from this “book” that they are not being able to analyze. The best example is: Cheating. If you ask a random person on the street what is “cheating”, he`ll most likely tell you that cheating is having sex with any person other than  

Men are more objectified than women. Yes, I am a woman, and I came to this conclusion, and I hate having to admit it. I have always vouched for women and women rights, and equality movements, but I came to realize recently that maybe men as well need similar movements. Objectification has been mostly associated with women being sexually objectified by men. While it is true women are often objectified and measured based on their looks, they are guilty of the same, but the matter of the objectification is sometimes different. A friend of mine was seeing someone she had recently met. One day we were  

These are some of my opinions. Feel free to disagree. Most people, even mature ones sometimes, do not know what is the difference between Lust, Infatuation, and Love. And I mean that truly. Sometimes a lot of people get so hung up on attraction and spark that they find it hard to distinguish these feelings.If you have a gaping hole in your heart or a big crack and honestly believe it can be mended when another person is with you, and you don't work on it, then any relationship you go into is going to fail.Love does not conquer all. It is easier to do that in movies and stories because it is hop

My Message to frustrated Singles, which is especially unpopular in this age of toxic positivity and magical thinking: That Fate, Luck/Chance, Geography, Demographics and Timing have just as much if not Greater impact on whether you find and keep a relationship than individual choices and attitudes - especially as you get older and options narrow down. Much of what happens Really has nothing to do with your choices and efforts. I’m not suggesting a complete absence of accountability and self-improvement. Of course not. Nor am I including Truly Dysfunctional people in this belief (those who try to m 

Most couples are held together by delusions. People often lack a basic understanding of their partner, and perhaps that’s for the best. I used to think you earn partnership through maturity. Bullshit. Partnership happens when one person’s fucked-up corresponds with another person's fucked-up. Kinda like a jigsaw puzzle depicting a land fill. If you want to be partnered, you need tenacity and willingness. That’s it. The rest: maturity, empathy, blah blah, is helpful. But relationships exist because teeth were clenched and closed fists hung on in determination. You can be single or coupled, but eit 

Unconditional love doesn’t exist &amp; Love can’t overcome everything. Every love comes with conditions. In a romantic relationship people are looking for someone who can fulfill their needs (for example sex, appreciation, support etc.). If someone can fulfill their needs and they are compatible they love the person, once the person stops fulfilling too many of their most important needs love starts to fade away, in the worst scenario it turns into hatred. Even in a parent-child relationship there is no real unconditional love, being their child is already a condition in itself. But apart from this  

Compromising and making sacrifices aren’t always the solution Source : Unsplash We’re constantly bombarded with the notion that compromising and making sacrifices are the key to a successful relationship, I’d like to think it’s not as black/white as that. While it’s healthy to think about the other person’s needs and meet each other halfway : There’s a fine line between compromising on what to eat for dinner or where to go on vacation than compromising your beliefs and values for your partner. I was at a networking event the other day and was speaking to an older man, happily married for over 35 ye 

I came across this girl on a social media. She pinged, I replied, frequencies matched and we felt a little less space between us. We lived in remote towns. We met only once. I got a spare day in her town and we decided to meet in a park. That evening, we talked about ants and galaxies. She leaned her head on my shoulder as sun bid us goodbye and the faint sunrays it left showed the brown tint in her eyes. She was gorgeous and so was that evening. We felt calm inside our rebellious heads. Our hands cupped each other as we walked, talking about nature and serendipities. Soon, we were back into our  

What ended your relationship with your best friend?
“They want your good life." This is how a close friend described the animosity of my ex-bestfriend and an ex close friend towards me. My bestfriend and I met during our first year in uni. I was 16 and she was 17. She was well off and I was dirt poor, but we became as close as sisters. I was in uni because of a scholarship. Although my scholarship included stipends, they were always delayed. So I often had no money for food and payment for my boarding house. Our university was two hours away from home by bus. I had five younger siblings and my dad, who's a carpenter, was often sick at the time. M 

I had been living in Oxford for about a year after moving down from Edinburgh. Was working in a pretty cool place that did awesome coffee in the daytime then transitioned into a cocktail place in the evenings. I started pretty much at the same time as another girl, Kayley. We hit it off straight away, bonding over a mutual hatred of our new manager 😂🤦🏼‍♀️ (We were 22, don’t judge!). We were hanging out outside of work etc and after about a year and a half we were, I guess, « best friends ».  My lease was up on my rental, and Kayley &amp; her boyfriend had a spare room in their place, which I gladl 

We moved in together We met at high school, I was 16, she was 18. She was the popular girl, pretty, never without a boyfriend since she had been 14. I was the nerd. With blue hair and a difficult home life. Still single and would stay so into my 20s. I was very dedicated to school work, because I wanted to get out. After high school, I left the country by myself for a while, then returned and started college in another, much bigger city. We kept in touch, met on the weekends. I was always the side-kick, she was the star. I was content with that. I met people, I got out, I was cool by proxy. There 

A birthday party. We had been friends for about 20 years. Two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year. Our birthdays were 17 days apart. She had my back emotionally and saw me through tough times with love and kindness. I hoped that I did the same for her. I lost count of the times that she’d called in a panic ‘cos she’d had a flip out at a boyfriends and wanted me to run round in my car and get her out of there before he came home. We laughed about those times. We cried over other times. We watched telly together on the phone when we were in different parts of the country. We share 

Many things. So many. This is going to be very long. We met at school, we weren't in the same class (she was in 9th and I in 10th grade) but some elective courses were for multiple classes so we had one of those together. I saw her drawing something in an anime style one day, and I had just recently gotten into anime and drawing, so I commented about it. We had a few conversations that year, though we didn't become friends just yet. I had to repeat 10th grade due to my grades. We didn't end up in the same class, but we ended up having a bunch of classes together anyways. The first day, I didn't  

“I've watched you bounce in and out of awful relationships every since I've known you, and I've always thought.. Why couldn't it be me?” But that wasn't what killed it… This was my best friend. I loved him like a brother: completely, fiercely and unconditionally. Let us call him Mark, because that is his name. Mark and I had first met when I moved in with a work colleague - his ex. She and Mark had moved from Scotland to London as a couple, then she had met someone else, split up with Mark, and asked her new partner to move in, and now they all lived in the same, awkward house! Anyway, I met the  

A reversal of fortunes. It’s very painful to think back about what happened to my friendship with Annie, but I will miss her until the day I die. We met at work when I was 25 and she was 22. It was a small office and we were the only two girls. She was such a sweet, fun, classy person and we bonded immediately. We spent the next 5 years working side by side sharing our joys, happinesses, trials and tribulations. I shared things with her that I never shared with anyone else and she did the same with me. We were closer than sisters. Annie had a wonderful, carefree life. She and her husband were qui 

Her actions and my blindness to people's faults. I met her through a school friend. Let's call her Zee. My school friend and I lost contact as she got married real young. Zee was really nice, was five years older than me, wise, had a brilliant mind and I was really taken by her. We both loved animals and rescued quite a few along the way. She even helped me get my first job. Our friendship spanned over twenty years, through her divorce, kids, birthdays , milestones etc. And I was there every step of the way meeting every criteria that a real friend should have. I always have been a bit of soft ta 

Her relationship with her boyfriend. I met Krupa (name changed) during my first year of college. We were in different majors but had chosen the same elective. We never spoke though, since we had already formed an opinion about each other (Judgmental, I know!) We had the Founder's Day celebration during our second semester, which required bringing in about 500 1st year students for a traditional dance (that involved different cultures). I was in a group of about 60 girls and our dance form was Dandiya (Gujarati culture). Fortunately or not, she was my dance partner, and we had no choice apart fro 

Going anonymous because this is very fresh. 2018 was a rough year. I was fired from my job after complaining about gender discrimination, and didn’t find a new job for about 7 months. I have a side business, so I was still working, although it wasn’t enough money to make up for my lost income. My 92 year old grandmother fell and broke her hip around the same time, and my father in law is in failing health. So I got to spend much of the summer using up airline miles to spend time with my family. I was also working on my business and negotiating a pre-lawsuit settlement with the company that fire 

What relationship sin should you avoid at all costs?
Sean, you’ve read enough of my answers about relationships to know that there is certainly far more than one relationship sin that should absolutely be avoided at all costs. I’m going to write a short list of the three most important things to avoid in any relationship, and then I’ll go into detail about each one in turn: First and foremost, as should be obvious, is infidelity.Secondly, and possibly equally important, is dishonesty, including the keeping of secrets.Refusal to openly communicate one’s feelings in a productive mannerSo obviously, the biggest relationship sin that is almost always  

It's 2019 and still there are some things which haven't changed over the past years. Instead they're getting worse. I'm talking about beliefs that we've developed about love and relationship. Now it's clearly seen nowadays how movies, music, TV, etc flaunt upon us a false picture of true love or an ideal relationship and reinforce us to believe it. We develop some unrealistic ideas in our mind about how a perfect relationship exists! And when we realize how certain things don't work as how we picture and fantasize it, we stumble and collapse! I guess the worst sin you could avoid doing in a rela 

My mind wanders down many paths of contemplation on this one. Several assumption must be made, because words do have meaning. I'll begin by tossing out the probable disqualifiers, so further cement my point later on. So, let's start by assuming that this is a consensual relationship that both people enter in to willingly and with good faith towards the other. Let's say that they both actually want this to work. That throws out the good ol' “Poison him in his sleep with undetectable drugs and collect the insurance money after I'm made a citizen" sin. And that sin is a doozie, but really it's not  

Everybody has a life. Its important to have some “me time” once in a while. For people who wonder what they look like in others' eyes need a break at times to look in the mirror and say , "Hey , I love you" In most relationships , relationships in general , one person is so much into the other, loves them to the moon and back , makes them their first priority and what not. However , to the other person , they are just an important aspect of their lives and not their lives altogether. Its important to note here that just because they don't love us back with the same passion as we do , we don't b 

There are several relationship sins that we should avoid. These include: Having many friends from the opposite sex. This makes people/partners/lovers/spouses jealous.Letting the other person always being the first one to text. You should show that you miss someone too. Today, text first.Taking breaks for no good reason. If we are doing well and not fighting a lot, no breaks are needed.Comparing our love to other people's love. Let us be ourselves.Denying each other sex and time to hang out. If you are of age, these are healthy.Gossiping about others. This shows that you are not happy. Just love

It’s going to be a really tiring day. The meeting is about to start with a major client, and the boss has already loaded you with the next deadline. Pearls of anxiety drop from your forehead. You can’t afford to screw this. You just can’t. You try to calm yourself down, but the negative possibilities start barraging your mind on a loop. You take a deep breath. You enter the room faking a smile. The presentation starts. Slide 1… slide 2… slide 3. The yawning face of the client is already making you dreary. The piercing glance from your boss is adding fear in the right quantities. You so want to sail thr 

1. Pride Does your ego or your pride prevent you from acknowledging your partner and their success? Are you overly consumed by your own importance or appearance and neglect your partner in the process? Do you refuse to admit when you are in the wrong? Or do you refuse to seek help when you need it, then resent your partner for it? If these sound familiar, you need to learn to let go of the ego and embrace humility. Start to acknowledge and appreciate the little things your partner does. Be prepared to concede when you are in the wrong. Swallow your pride and ask for help occasionally. This may 

You should never turn your partner’s generosity into your entitlement. For example: In my previous marriage, I cooked all the dinners. I would make his plate, and bring it to wherever he was. I would do this for anyone I cooked for, because I’m sweet like that. It’s a quiet way of giving affection and being considerate. One time, early in our marriage, he had a busy couple weeks. So, to be thoughtful, I began packing his lunch for those days. He needed to leave early, so I began cooking and packing him a breakfast to reheat at work. These were things I did out of love and kindness. Fast forward fi 

What relationship sin should you avoid at all costs? Avoid the sin of believing or thinking that it’s still all about you. I am kind of aiming all this at my bros, but it’s for either partner. When you were single, it was all about you. But if you are in a serious relationship or are married, it’s now also about him or her. Avoid this sin by considering the following: Don’t be a slob. You come home at the end of the day and the house is a mess or there’s dirty dishes piled in the sink, do not ignore it. Roll up your sleeves and clean it up. Share those responsibilities with your SO. My sweet wife  

They were in a relationship from last 3 months. They were friends before they were lovers. So one day on text… He - You’re getting annoying by every next day. You have that guy friend Shubh na, I should find some other girl too. (With a laughing emoji) She replied… She - Yes, Why not? So someone in mind? He - Oh why not.. That girl who approached from Facebook. She was drop dead gorgeous. I’ve sent you a picture no? She - She’s pretty. But the other girl, That one from Instagram was prettier. He - Yes, How can I forget about her! But her messages were lagging. She was taking time between replies. That 

What is it that nobody tells you about having children?
That you will be chained to your house and unable to leave without a gigantic hassle each and every time. And if you have multiple young children (twins or close in age) it will not be twice as hard, but exponentially more hard, to do anything. That you should understand that you are now a prisoner who is dependent on the willingness or ability of others to help you escape your prison, even if it is for a little while. If not, then you have to bring them with your EVERYWHERE. You can't run out to the store for eggs or milk because you forgot them. No, it doesn't work this way. First everyone h 

Since I was told little or nothing about having kids, this question, for me, is a wide-open field. Here are the thoughts I find most helpful: 1. Good parenting is both the simplest thing in the world and the hardest thing in the world. 2. It is the simplest thing because there is one cardinal rule: whatever behavior or character trait you want your kids to display, you must model for them. If you want them to read instead of just mindlessly turning on the tube, let them see you doing that. If you want them to show restraint, let them see you giving a calm and civil answer to an impudent customer 

No one tells you anything truthful about having children. Seriously. I don't know why we keep it all to ourselves. I mean, we tell others the good stuff. How sweet new babies are.

What is your shortest relationship?
Thirty-six years. In 1982, I was seventeen and had never been on a date. One night I dreamed that I was already married to a woman I’d known for seven years. In the dream, I woke up beside this woman I knew to be my wife. I had a memory of the previous seven years. The ups and downs of our relationship, how we lived together for a while, then got married. Lately, we’d had a number of arguments. Later that day, I moved out to live “north” somewhere, but pined for my wife the whole time. Then, after a year, I went south and we were together again. Two years later, I was nineteen and still hadn’t b 

What is your shortest relationship? A date. I had met some guys through a Jewish singles organization before the internet existed. One guy said, “Whoever gets to the movie theater first should get the tickets.” The movie was The Jerk. What he didn’t say was, “We’re going Dutch.” This was around the end of 1979 or early 1980. I hated the movie, and told him, “You can either watch the movie to the end or leave with me.” He decided to come with me. We had dinner out—also Dutch (not the norm back then). If we had agreed to it ahead of time, it might have been different. I asked the next guy I met thr 

One week. It was my second relationship ever. After years of loneliness and longing for a relationship I finally had my first kiss when I was 17. I dated that girl for a month before we broke up. I quickly followed that relationship with another one. There was maybe a week between the two relationships. I felt great about the girl. We had been friends for a year. We had conversations via text that went on for hours. Our relationship had a depth unparalleled in my life. We frequently discussed our world views and that was rare for me at the time. Her company filled me up with joy. My life found a r 

Just (almost) a day. It was me who fell for him first and also, ended the relationship first. We met through a mutual friend who always egged us on going on a date. We finally did. He was tall, cute and had a good sense of humour. But it was the outside of him that made me trust without any hesitation. We were just having a small talk about our lives, interests, etc., just like what people normally do in their first date, before I realized that we literally had nothing in common. But I thought I would never let that hinder my affection and went on giving him a try. After nearly a fat two hours  

I had a one day relationship, or at least I like to think I did. Years ago, while studying anthropology, I decided to visit my city’s famous Field Museum of Natural History to do a little research for a paper I was working on; while traveling there on the bus, I noticed a young man flipping thru the pages of a Hebrew/English dictionary, as if desperately trying to figure out how to ask something. When our eyes met, he blurted, “Is Museum soon?” Though I’ve never been outside the U.S., I imagined how scared I’d be traveling on public transit in a strange city, and immediately attempted to reassu 

I take it that by “relationship” you mean something more than just one date or even several dates, something with some substantial degree of connectedness, bond, or alliance. Most people would think romantic relationship although that is not necessarily so. You might also have intended it to mean friendship or kinship/ My shortest romantic relationship was one year. See Steve Alexander's answer to Can you tell a (real) story of gay love? My shortest kinship relationship was four days and happened just recently. By kinship relationship, I mean physical presence in each others’ company. The kinshi 

Here’s my shortest non-relationship. I met a woman in a park when I walked my dog. We were both extremely friendly to each other and ended up sitting under a tree and just talking….She kept going to her car, but I didn’t put 2 and 3 together…It started getting dark and she asked if I would like to come to her house for some shrimp scampi that she had just made before coming to the park. Well, I was hungry and I love shrimp scampi so I took her up on her offer. Plus she lived less than a mile from me in the Sierra foothills. I followed her out of the parking lot and couldn’t help but notice tha 

The very first girl I ever worked up the courage to ask out said yes and then dumped me 14 hours later lol. I was 17 and officially entering my senior year with the world's shortest relationship record. She was the first girl I ever asked for her number and the first girl I had ever talked to and the first girl to invite me over to her house. She broke up with me after her and her mom dropped me off and her mom asked me a ton of questions about the run down triplex I lived in. I thought these were new BF questions so I told her my parents had never owned a house and we had lived there for 15 yea 

About 4 hours but I still remember it like it was yesterday. I sat next to this really pretty young lady about my age on a plane. I was about 25. She had shoulder length dark brown hair and a really pretty face. Her skin was milky white and completely unblemished. She was incredibly shy. I’m on the opposite end of the shyness spectrum so I started chatting with her. She had been in a bad relationship and he was an asshole. She left him. He followed her around and she kept hiding from him. She hadn’t seen him in a while and life was getting back to normal. She was moving back home to be with her  

HALF AN ELEVATOR RIDE! Me: Graduate School, Her: Senior. LOVED LOVED LOVED her “look.” Was told she was smart and kind. Never had the courage to ask her out (VERY unlike me. I was intimidated by her looks.) Near the end of grad school, I’m invited to a wedding. I’m there and she is too. Friends and acquaintances start telling me SHE “wants you to go talk to her.” A glass of champagne later, I do. It’s a hit. “I’ve seen you around lots of time!” “I know, why didn’t you come talk to me?” Etc. Spent a couple hours talking, drinking, watching people. She touching me. I pretend to blush, oh gosh. A b 

What is the weirdest thing a girlfriend has done to make sure you were not cheating on her?
What should I do? My GF is saying that either we get married or she will dump me. We have a 7-year relationship but I'm still not ready to get married. I love her but she is leaving me unless we arrange a wedding in the next 3 months.
Every relationship gets to a point where you decide to get married or break up. Both of you need to break up. I was in your girlfriend’s shoes. Thankfully I wasted 2, not 7 years of my life with a guy. Those types are never serious nor ready for that level of commitment but too scared of being alone. Same thing; had the DTR with him. Later he surprised me with a beautiful proposal, but shortly after, the engagement was extremely stressful; nothing changed. One day he’s like yes let’s get married and next day oh I’m not sure. It was exhausting. Wedding planning helped me get away from that stress  

Been married several times and I’ve got to give you two ends of the spectrum. On one hand, marriage is for suckers. I mean you’ve been with her for 7 years. What have you not done that you can only do in a marriage? File joint taxes? Guarantee each other’s inheritance? Visit in the hospital? Get on the other’s insurance plan? All stupid reasons to get married. You mentioned something about different countries? Immigration is actually a good reason to get married. Other than that, a cynic would say it sounds like she’s got other plans for you or your fortunes. He’d say “If I was in your shoes, I’ 

My grandma had a saying for this. “Shit. Or get off the pot.” If you don’t know that you want to marry a woman after 7 years (!) of being in a relationship, then you need to figure out your mind and fast. I told my (now) husband after less than a year of dating that I was going to have to make a job decision in the next few months. I needed to have a firm decision from him on whether or not we were going to get married or not before I decided to stay where we were living at the time or move back to be closer to my family. I was not staying without a ring on my finger, or at least a firm propos 

Your gf said that to you? You mean your “girlfriend”? 7 years, and she's still your “gf”. Wow! Seven years she's been acting like your wife, you've been treating her like a wife. Sleeping in her bed each night, nursing you through sickness, washing your clothes, sucking your dick…. 7 fuckin' years you've been sucking the youth out of her and you don't respect that woman enough to ASK HER to honor you by becoming your wife.., and she wants to get married. She should have left you a long time ago. You are abusive and self-centered. If after 7 years you “are not ready”, then you really need to give her 

I had a fiancé just like you. He wasn’t ready after many years, almost 7. I one day got sick of his not being ready to just grow up and figure out what he wanted in life and I left him. Two years later (after being with HIM for 7) I was not only married, I was pregnant. No joke. So all these years later, I am happily married to someone else with a child. Coincidentally, my ex-fiancé lives 7 blocks from my new house. We stayed friends on FB, and I got a little concerned about the fact that we both live in the same small town. I looked up his address, wanting to be sure I wasn’t going to run int 

Wow this sounds familiar. I also had a 7-year relationship, in which she wanted to get married and I “wasn’t ready to.” I have to say, your girlfriend is being pretty kind, respectful, and vulnerable to express her needs to you. My girlfriend simply got frustrated, and ended the relationship. In fact, I think most women would just leave. What you have to understand is that your girlfriend loves you, but she also has important life goals which include marriage and probably family. These are very important to her. What you should ask yourself is “Why am I not ready?” For me, there were some important as 

This is a tough &amp; hard question to answer since so many variables can affect you &amp; your decision so I’m just going to try and do this on a basic and “Man to Man” kind of talk. As you’ve said, you have a 7 year long relationship and I will presume that you &amp; her are “In Love” , that you both do truly care for one another and enjoy time spent with each other and consider the past 7+ years a good investment of time. You then need to ask yourself “Why am I not ‘Ready’ for Marriage”? What is holding you back ? What are you afraid of ? What else do you feel you need to do before you feel like you wil 

I knew a guy once that was in a 5 year relationship but he just wasn’t ready to “settle down”. I talked with him a bunch of times about it because he was such a nice and kind guy and the girl was the love of his life and he would only ever get married and have children with her, he said. He couldn’t explain why not now. She was patient and seemed to be okay with the arrangement though. Fast forward 6 years. Whatever barrier makes the thought of being committed so impossible to him has not diminished. She is now in her late-ish 30s and he knows she wants kids. So he tells her she should forget h 

This is such a great question and I’m so glad you made the decision to ask it. NEVER let someone pressure you into marriage! PERIOD! Marriage is a TREMENDOUS commitment and an AWESOME responsibility! If you are not ready, you are NOT READY! NO ONE should pressure someone into marriage and, quite frankly, no one should WANT to pressure someone into marriage! People who want to get married, but are with a partner who feels they are not ready, can ALWAYS leave and go meet someone else, but NO ONE should ever pressure someone into getting married! Let me offer you some thoughts. Many women and men  

Generally, I think giving ultimatums are distasteful. However, context matters, and in the context of a 7 year relationship, I don't think its particularly unreasonable. What you need to do is to be honest with yourself. Question 1: Do you want to marry her? Possible answers: No. If this is your answer, I think its obvious that you have an irreconcilable difference. Your relationship is over, maybe it even lasted too long. You have to accept this and move on, and allow her move on.Maybe/I'm not sure. If this is your answer, we'll come back to that shortly.Yes, but not in 3 months. This also requir

Why are some guys so disrespectful towards good-looking girls? They treat them like an object. How do they manage to get girlfriends?
A beautiful woman will seemingly have unlimited options when it comes to men. These women are pursue by every type of man, the confident, kind hearted, successful, charming, and wealthy men at one of the spectrum to the mean, distant, full of attitude bad boys on the other end of the spectrum and everyone else in between. Now, you would think that the rich, good-looking, and charming guys would get the beautiful girl, right? And they do for the most part get the girl but some attractive women do not like these types of guys. Or, should I clarify, they like guys like these in front of the camera o 

There are some good answers here already, but I thought I’d make some additions that are worth considering. I know it’s risky boiling personality traits down to specific aspects. Not everyone is going to fit neatly into these categories. But: Males have a tendency to find worth and value in their accomplishments. They like to be able to do things, and how good they are at those things is an indication of their success as an individual.Females have a tendency to find worth and value in human interactions. They use their relationships and their influence on other people as an indication of their s

You attract the kind of person that you are. I have read plenty of answers on Quora that justify beautiful women being disrespectful to all men. The justification goes something like this: All women get hit on by men far more than men get hit on by women. A beautiful woman gets hit on much more than an ordinary woman. Therefore, the best way, perhaps the only way, for a beautiful woman to narrow down the number of men who hit on her is to be rude to all men, from the beginning, regardless of how polite or rude they are, to her. Now, let’s flip this logic. A good-looking man is aware of the way t 

I’m going to inform you of something that should be common sense, but most men are (acting like they’re) too stupid to pick up on. If you have a Facebook profile, find some attractive woman who has friends in the thousands, preferably someone whose friend list crosses 4 000 people. Most will be men, I assure you of that. Now choose some post of hers where she says some lame quote or writes something totally erroneous or at least debatable. Watch all of the likes and hearts and wows and read the hundreds of comments of men complimenting her beauty, her intelligence, or both.Did that? Good, beca 

Yes, I get it. It hurts doesn’t it when you don’t get the attention you usually get from everyone around you, from guys, from friends, from people. Getting attention and getting validated seems important to a lot of pretty girls but we guys know one thing. Attention is something you crave for. And we ignore you because we know you crave for attention. It’s not about disrespect this disrespect that. It’s that you are meeting guys like myself, who don’t give a shit who you are, what you look like or what you got to offer. I’m not going to be nice to you because you’re pretty. I’m also not going to go  

Why are some guys so disrespectful towards good-looking girls? They treat them like an object. How do they manage to get girlfriends? Having been the “nice guy” who dated the hot girl after she finally dumped the “jerk” I can say that there are some very distinct patterns. All of her friends were hot, all dating jerks. Why didn’t they think more of themselves? Why cheapen themselves and go for guys who don’t treat them right? Why end up being someone’s FWB? It doesn’t always start like that. Sometimes the jerk starts out being charming, caring, attentive. Then they start to get busy at work. They  

A video popped up in my youtube recommendations today.  The video showed photos of Selena and Hailey side by side. If you don’t already know, Hailey Bieber is married to Justin Bieber, Selena’s ex. Since marrying Justin, Hailey and Justin have had their relationship stripped naked by the Public. I won't go into details of how Hailey and Justin have been accused, exposed and compared, but I will say that since day one of their relationship, Hailey has been constantly compared to Selena while Justin has been accused of still being in love with her. It looks like a never-ending, downhill battle with H 

Most guys wants the attention of a beautiful women, but often don’t get it, but many don’t get it and out of those many some become resentful and vengeful towards good looking women in general. Some guys also want beautiful girls to feel insecure about themselves and they do it by disrespecting attractive women. Most guys who treat women like objects and disrespect women in general can’t find girlfriend, in fact these type of men usually can’t hold a long term relationships at all. If the men in question is good looking/ or willing to pay someone then he may get a lot of short term relationship 

You ever meet a stunningly beautiful woman who dates asshole after asshole?  I know I have met plenty of them. I even dated a few, when I was that asshole. When you stop and think about it, it makes absolutely no sense, right? A really beautiful woman will have LOTS AND LOTS of options. So there must be some successful, confident and charming men who are also kind and caring, right? It would only make sense that those kinds of guys would pursue her too, so why does she keep dating those assholes? As I started to understand myself better, it became clear to me why that is. Some women are wildly attrac 

I've been observing women a lot. Not “watching them” or “leering at them" or “ogling them”. Just observing them, and to be precise, understanding how they look at other women. Trust me, it's the women who check out other women more than men do. For many women, other women are “things” to be assessed, judged, graded, certified, compared, gossipped at, rated, berated and whatnot. For many men, the only thing that matters perhaps is the sex appeal of women. For many women, the perceptions about other women are extremely complex and far more denigrating, and many times they end up writing them off a 

What is the most embarrassing thing your parents have caught you doing with your bf/gf?
When we were Young I was at a friend's house and we were messing around outside, and he says let's go in my basement. We were messing around with some of his stuff any turns to me and says that he really enjoyed rubbing himself. I didn't know what to say. He starts taking his hand and starts rubbing himself through his pants. I could see him getting excited right away. He said to me why don't you try it and reaches over grabs my hand and starts me rubbing myself. Needless to say it didn't take me long and I was excited. First time I was ever doing anything like this. As we're both are getting  

It was a calm and quiet Friday night. All I could hear was a ticking clock and our refrigerator whirring in the background. Our black Labrador Retriever, Rosebud, was following me around, licking her chops. I was a junior in high school at the time and I was alone in the house with my father, who was working quietly in his den. My mom was in Las Vegas for the weekend, celebrating my aunt’s birthday, while my younger sister was at a friend’s house for a sleepover. My dad was one of those people who, when involved in a project, would be so lost in concentration that he would lose all track of tim 

First of all, I have got the wierdest life on this planet, so this has happened a few times. This was the most interesting (however, she was not exactly my girlfriend and not exactly my mom): I am a boy. I got raised by gay moms because my parents divorced when I would just breastfeed. My real dad remarried soon and had a daughter just a year younger than me, let's call her Ava, and her wife, let's call her Dior. Not forcing but you will enjoy this more after reading this too: So, I fell in love suddenly with Ava and we would pull off our clothes whenever my dad and Dior would leave the house. Two 

Well, this story is pretty embarrassing but it doesn’t involve my parents, it involves my boyfriend’s dad. So, being we started off as really good friends, I was always allowed over. Stayed most weekends, in fact. Well, for the majority of his life, my boyfriend, “J,” has only lived with his mother after his parents divorced a little over a decade ago. His dad recently moved in with them, as he had gotten a new job and it would be much easier for him to get to this new job from J’s house, as opposed to where he had been staying, much further away. So J’s mom offered to let his dad stay. It was  

Unfortunately I have been caught with 3-4 of my ex-girlfriends since I was 16. So I have a few stories to choose from. The most recent was last summer, my ex girlfriend and I were living with my mom and she was out of town for the previous week. Unfortunately she came home a few days early.It was about noon, and her and I were in the middle of the living room but naked! This ex and I were wild when it came to sex. Try most anything once. She has asked in the past if she could try licking my asshole. We had already finished a huge bottle of Vodka (by noon) .She said that she liked it when I lic 

All similar to many of the others. Yes, it involves sexual content. (Not my parents but his!) so ok, I was 16, visiting my school bf of 17 at the time. It was late at night. Probably round 11 or so. Most of house was asleep. Or so we thought. We were under a duvet, making out on the couch in the tv room late at night. We soon got naked from waist down and got busy. I was lying on my side in front of him and he was giving it to me from behind. Real nice, slow passionate love making. Suddenly his brother (2yrs older) walks in. It did not help that I had a major crush on him too.. .. Brother says " 

I'm glad my brother doesn't have a quora but this story is based on him. He used to routinely bring his girlfriend over to the house when my parents were out and I wasn't born yet so I didn't get to make fun of him even more. One day mom decided to pop out for grocery shopping. So my brother rang up his girlfriend to come over. They were at home for a few hours and then they heard the sound of a car pulling over in to the car park. My brother is panicking and he quickly jumps up and proceeds to drag his girlfriend around looking for a place to hide her. He hears mom coming up the stairs and then 

I’m 13 and me and my gf have been dating for about 6 months so one time i told my mom that if my gf can come over and we can hang out in the pool [At this point we have been dating for 2 months.] so my mom said ofc she can so i called my gf and the next day it was a sunday she came over and i took her to meet my mom and dad and they really liked her. After that i took her to my room and we were watching a movie. When the movie ended i said lets go to the pool and we went to go change and then we she came out i was like dam you look sexy and the she blushed and we kissed and i loved it. We got  

My good friend was dating my sister and had snuck into her room to make out with her thru her bedroom 

 I was in 10th grade and I had exams. My father and mother got separated when I was only 8 years old and it had made me devastated. My mother was a working woman and because of work she had to go to out of city sometimes for a day. She used to drop one of my grandparents at home and I was quite attached to both of them. One day on April 24, 2014, my mother had to go out of city for a day and she asked me to stay at my grandparent’s house or call them at home. She was quite busy at that time that she didn’t even had time to call them. I had another plan in my mind, I thought I would call my then  

Jungkook said he wants to talk more with foreigners in the future. Is there any chance that he will have a foreign girlfriend?
My girlfriend is a Trump supporter. Should I leave her?
What a sorry state the world is in. You should not leave your girlfriend on the grounds that she supports Trump alone. If you don’t like her or aren't attracted to her than leave- but ending a relationship over political views is foolish. Social media and political pundits would insist that politics is the only thing that matters. With Trump’s 2016 victory they have declared war on the system and Trump supporters and would hardly shed a tear if they all died tomorrow. Politics is not the only thing that matters. Political views and social views are just the opinions of people. This myth that Trump 

Yes. Bottom line is that when the honeymoon and lust period fades, it is shared goals and values that promote long lasting love. Clearly if you support Bernie, you have different values than someone who supports Trump. It doesn’t mean that finding the love of your life is as simple as finding a woman who shares the same political opinions, there are other facets to consider. But if you are a Bernie supporter, you are likely more community oriented, and value empathy, sharing resources, helping others, rather than being self-centered, valuing personal wealth over other people. Also, what seems  

This is the world we live in now! OMG, is this the world we want to live in??? Historically speaking, there have been many loving and successful couples that cheered one side of the aisle or the other that have gone on to be married, have children and build happy lives together. No problems. These days, and I have seen and heard many cases of this taking place, there are families that refuse to celebrate the typical holidays due to the various political beliefs within the family. The Democrats want absolutely nothing to do with those that not only support the Republican's, but those that support d 

It's real simple really. At this point in time, for one to be a trump supporter one of these conditions has to be met. A, they are misinformed and have been convinced that trump has accomplished more good than harm (emphasis on misinformed) B, they totally uninformed, and have been indoctrinated to believe that Republicans can do no harm, and that democrats are evil commie baby killers Or c, they are informed, and actually like trump, his attitude, his incoherent policy, and the malignant behavior of the GOP. In situation a and b, there is hope. One who is uniformed can be informed, one who is misi 

Someone answered this question much better than me on a much similar topic. His name is Mohamed Ghassoub, and this was his answer: I'm sorry to say that, but I think she should break up with you since you want tobreak up with her cause of her political views. You should know that no matter what your views are, it’s not a bad idea to use politics as a filter when looking for a partner—especially if there are issues you’re super-passionate about. BUT not everyone needs to be perfectly politically compatible to have a healthy relationship—look at high-profile political commentators James Carville and 

It’s interesting to find that one anonymous respondent is asking the questioner to listen tothe Trump-supporting girlfriend, but not the other way around. I personally would wish topose a follow-up question before going so far out on a limb as to volunteer an answer. If,more specifically, the couple happened to live in isolation on a teeny, tiny island, such thattheir political beliefs could not possibly have any real-world repercussions, and especiallyif the girlfriend was not planning to vote in 2020, then I would probably advise the questioner to stay with the girlfriend. But to cite th 

Trump is a sexist, racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic and dishonest. Unfortunately, I would have to question anybody who couldn’t comprehend that he’s not a good choice for anything but especially for President of The United States. I do know of a very successful marriage where the husband is a Democrat and the wife is a Republican but they got together way before Trump and there’s never been as bad a Presidential nominee as bad as Trump in my lifetime. Not even Sarah Palin was this bad… and she was baddddddddddd. Anybody who thinks this guy is going to make America great again, despite him not pay 

No. President Trump is doing everything he can to help all people! He is trying to keep the economy stimulated, giving people money to keep them afloat. He can't fix all the wrongs that have put our country in this horrible situation. It's not His fault our systems that are already in place have created a divide and have made peole bitter, scared and fighting for their lives. The pandemic is an un precidented situation and he is doing what he can to keep people alive. Despite his unfiltered comments sometimes made impulsively and without proper time to be diplomatically correct, He is really t 

My brother cut off communications with me because I didn’t support Mr. Trump, so why not? If my brother can forget blood ties to support an idiot and he wants to act like an idiot, that’s his choice. Idiots are who they are regardless of who they support in a rather idiotic presidential race, so anything goes. I hated my brother’s decision to support Reagan, Nixon, and Bush, and I was right about their self serving interests and had every reason to despise his choices he still stands by, such as the war on drugs, Viet Nam, The Iraq war, and the defilement of the U.S. Constitution. I’m not again 

First of all, you need to talk it over with her. You don’t need to change her mind, just understand what she believes. You should also tell her what you believe, that way things are clear between you two. If either of you say something unacceptable to the other, you need to either find a way around it, or move on. Second of all, your relationship is your own, it should be your decision, but you should also be well informed on both sides. You may want to watch for red flags, but that goes for any relationship. My boyfriend and I can’t talk about politics, otherwise we get into huge fights, but a 

How can I tell if my girlfriend really loves me?
Girls can be quite expressive and obvious. When a woman loves you, she will dive into your world and make you her world. She will try to know everything about your world, mix up in your world. Your family will interest her more than her own family.She will take efforts for you, she will do lots of stuff for you. She will make you feel special. She will try to know what bothers you and cover up for it. She will try and understand you more, your preferences and tastes, and surprise you more often than that.She would care for you and advise you like you are her baby. Well, it's inherently there in

Actions and emotions are always in tune. If a girl truly loves you, her actions will be in tune with it. Never judge a girl by her words, the truth always lies in her actions. Most guys find girls confusing because girls usually don’t follow up on what they seem to be saying. The thumb rule to follow with girls is to base your judgments on their actions, rather than their words. Just because a girl tells you that she loves you, does not mean that she really feels love for you deep down. Girls are usually not very decided about what they want so they just follow their intuition unconsciously. That 

You don't.  Even though texting is now a huge part of how we convey information with each other, it misses out on a very crucial part of human communication: body language or nonverbal communication.   When we talk to one another in person, the majority of the way we communicate does not involve words!  With an emotion like love, how your girlfriend interacts with you in a physical space is a much more important indicator of how she feels about you than what she says in text messages.  She might say, "I love you SOOO much! &lt;3 &lt;3" in a text message, but when you're together, for example, she mai 

I think the question here is why are you questioning that she does? Is is because you’re hearing warning bells about her behaviour or is it because you really can’t see why she loves you? If its the first, one of the hardest lessons I learned and one of the wisest is, if you hear warning bells, listen to them, as long as they are genuine warning bells and not bells of your own making. Humans have a remarkable ability to self sabotage, due to our own lack of belief in ourselves and sometimes we can start reading signs and portents into things because we’re so afraid of losing someone and we end u 

Thanks for such a lovely A2A. Well, I think here are some of the points. If she is walking with you, suddenly she holds your hand tightly after seeing a gang of boys. Yes, she loves you.If she acts with complete maturity in front of others but behaves like a two year old, in front of you, yes she loves you.If your, just a Hi message sets a big smile on her face, and she puts her hair flick beside her ear. Yes, she loves you.If she really cares more for you and your family, aww, she loves you.If she says that she wants a junior you in the future, yes she loves you.If she is jealous and angry when

There various ways to know if your girlfriend loves you or not... 1. If your girlfriend loves you, she will be anxious to please you.2. If she loves you, she will be eager to see you all the time.3. If your girlfriend loves you, she will not expect you to be the only one who calls her more frequently. If your girlfriend hardly call you with the excuse that she doesn't have call credit all the time, then re-evaluate your relationship again!4. If she loves you, she will trust you unconditionally - even when she sees you in the company of other girls. She will not just jump to hasty conclusions 

Well this is interesting. Just understand this, if she really loves you, the first thing is that you will start doubting yourself whether you deserve her or not. And besides “ I love you”, she'll do things unconditionally. If you are really confused, you can look for signs. Tell her you're down with fever and you will find that the only person who is as worried as your mom and sister is your girl. Those hourly calls asking how you feel, have you eaten something, say it all.Tell her to wake you up at an odd hour. Let's say 4am. Trust me, it doesn't matter when she sleeps. She will get up at 3:30

Women are unpredictable beings. They are emotional and they change their minds easily. They can be impulsive and surprising. They can easily fall in love, and later on have a change of heart. This is one of the causes of men’s heartbreaks. However, when a woman matures and experiences true love, she can be so selfless that she becomes so vulnerable. She would not let emotions sway her from side to side. She will be faithful to you. 1. She takes care of you like a mom. You would know how much your girlfriend loves you based on how she takes care of you. Her mother instinct makes her do everythin 

I’d been someone’s girlfriend for 4 years, so I think I can answer this question based on my experience in a serious relationship. You’ll know if your girlfriend really loves you when: She cares for you more than you would even care for yourself; she’ll even encourage you to take supplements and share with you her own vitamins/supplements that she thinks are really good for the health.She can’t wait to tell you stories about her day; she will text/chat you throughout the day even if you don’t reply right away. (Girls are better multi-taskers than boys; it’s a fact)She’ll ask you how’s your day, 

Oh my; this is a question I struggle with myself. We all want to be loved the way we want to be loved. And all of us have different love languages, and different styles and different measurements. So; I can get right down and tell you that it's how she makes you feel loved. But that's not accurate enough because sometimes you can't just base your answer on how you "feel" loved (maybe you cannot "see" or comprehend the level of love she has for you). Since different people show love in their own unique way; let's explore further. I suggest you to take a pen and paper and sit yourself down and try y 

How do I divorce my Roblox girlfriend?
My girlfriend is pregnant and I don’t have the time, desire, or money to take care of a child, but she insists on keeping it. What should I do?
Did some heavenly creature come and keep that baby inside her?No right. You had sex with her and she is pregnant. So this statement that she is pregnant is little unjustified. Firstly, take responsibility for your actions and say,”I have made my girlfriend pregnant.” Secondly, do you know how much a woman has to go through while aborting the baby? Do you understand the risks of aborting the baby? Sometimes it takes three months to completely flush the foetus out where the mother is given unbearable painful injections daily. Sometimes the procedure is almost similar to a surgery depending on the 

Do you know why sex shouldn't happen under 18 in most countries? Because to have a child you need to not be a child yourself and you need to be grown up, have a job and be able to take care of that child. It's not the government or anyone else's job. Most religions say sex before marriage is not allowed. Because they understand the basic premise that in order to bring a child in the world, 2 people need to be involved in the creation of that new life and those 2 people need to be cooperatively responsible for raising said child with values, rules and love. Before spouting your seed into her with 

I hate people and mainly women when they say it’s her body, thus her baby and choice. Why the fuck are men taken out of the equation? Nature did not fucking make both men and women able to give birth. It is in every way the man’s choice too. Having said that, the baby is yours. You have to decide what kind of a person you are? You are not the first man to have knocked up a woman and has left. I married the woman who got pregnant by deceiving me. She told me she was on the pill but wasn’t. She wanted me to stay with her For her it worked. I have no regrets. I am not with her anymore. But the fact t 

Get a vasectomy right away, you are obviously not fit to consider parenting. If this isn’t just a childish click bait question then I have to question if you really are a CEO In California as your bio says. People in this position are usually both responsible and reasonably intelligent, qualities you appear devoid of if this question is anything to go by. If you didn’t want to risk a pregnancy you should have sheathed up. There is no way you can claim you don’t know where babies come from. What should you do? Man up and take some responsibility. There is a baby coming on the scene soon and that c 

Well make the time and money and the desire will develop after you hold your baby in your arms for the first time. She wants to keep the baby. Imagine if you abort it and you’ll always have at the back of your mind that there could have been a life that you got rid of. And that you caused a girl psychological damage by forcing her to abort. It’s not a good feeling to live the rest of your life with, if you have even a semblance of love left. Instead of complaining that you don’t want a baby, maybe you can write a list of all the cool things a baby could bring, like aspects you may be able to enj 

This is what happens when you don’t learn to use at least condoms and you don’t learn to keep your pecker in your pants. Doesn’t matter if you don’t have the time, money or desire to look after a child. It is her choice to keep the child whether you like it or not. You are responsible for paying child support until that child turns 18. If that child opts to go to college or university, you are obligated to pay that child support until that child graduates with their degree or doctorate. Should you decide to be a deadbeat dad, a warrent will be issued for your arrest and they will hunt you down l 

You state you don’t have the time, desire or the money to take care of a child, but it seems like you had the desire and time to get on top of her and stick your Bishop in her and make her pregnant. Don’t you believe in using a condom or a rubber when you are having sex…? Remember your girlfriend did not get pregnant on her own and she only became pregnant because you stuck your Bishop in her without a condom or rubber on and you came in her. You should have pulled out and since you did not pull out, now you have to deal with all of this. Your girlfriend should keep the child and she should not  

Honestly there is nothing you can do, but prepare to pay your child support. Unfortunately we live in a world where men dont have a say on weather they bring life to this earth or not. If it was the other way around your girlfriend could abort or give the baby up for adoption with out your consent ( totally unfair) even if you wanted to keep the child. I would speak to an attorney about signing your rights off as the father. Not sure what state you live in, and many states wont just let you sign off because you dont want to be a dad.

You get your girlfriend pregnant &amp; then decide too late that you don’t have the time ,desire or money to take care of a child ! what you really mean is that you have had your fun and now don’t want to take the responsibility for the pregnancy that ensued from it,well maybe you shouldn’t have had unprotected sex then.None of us ever really has the money to take care of a child we just divert the funds we would have spent on other things to spending them on the child as they grow up, What you really mean when you say you don’t have the money is you would rather spend the money you do have on som 

So hang on a second. You had the time and the desire to perform the act that leads to having children, but now that it's actually happened, NOW you can't be bothered? So, you ultimately have two choices. Either: a) deal with the fact that you're having a child, which isn't like some toy that you can just discard when you're done with it and move on (because children have feelings and emotions and all that stuff that you have), and raise this child to be a productive member of society, OR… b) Tell your girlfriend that you want no part of this, and that you're going to be removed from her and your c 

What are some unofficial signs that you have a girlfriend?
Have you ever accidentally encountered your ex, several years after you parted? If so, what was the reaction?
It was the last night that I would ever see her alive. And it was also the last kiss we ever shared.  What I never wrote about, and now, I think it’s finally time, is the last night we were truly alone together. This wasn’t so much an accidental encounter, as an unconsciously willing one.  It’s 2002. She had been married to my oldest friend for 10 years. She was the mother to a 9 year old boy and a 7 year old girl who were both named after me (first and middle name). I was visiting in the area, a 2 day layover in the long trip home after a long stint working overseas. I was visiting family and deci 

YES. It was in the gym. Thanks to my myopia I didn't recognise him on the spot -he was something like 5 meters away- but I did notice the resemblance of the figure.. and there we was. My heart actually skipped a beat. For a second, it was like we never parted… same accellerated heart beats, same dizziness.. and just like that, it ended. We both went on with the training and didn't even greet. We parted after a 5 years relationship, I was 18 and he was 22 soon to be 23 when it started. We were DEEP in love, to be honest I think I'll never love anyone like I loved him. We used to dream about our fut 

Yes! Backstory: I discovered that my ex had been having *one and done* encounters since we had been married. Then, i find out he has started an actual affair. Then, as if those werent enough..i come home unexpectedly to find my best friend in my bed with him. She was his affair. I was shattered. Took my dog and left immediately. He pleaded with me not to go..that he loved me and the affair was only a piece of ass.. I said in response *a damn big piece of ass*. I encouraged him to tell me that he loved me so that she could hear because I wanted her to feel the pain and always to remember his words 

Let tell you a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down…Okay jokes aside, yes I actually ran into the man I was engaged to a couple of years after we had a very bad break up. Now I won’t go into the nasty details because at the end of the day we both made peace thanks to the run in. But for back story, I was 18 years old, I joined a roleplaying site for anime and nerd roleplay stuff. Yes I am a roleplaying via text. I enjoy it. I still do it. Infact I’m still on the site. I found him and the site on a whim via google. And joined in my senior year of highschool. I enjoyed the si 

I ran into my ex last week in Bangkok. It was awkward, to say the least. For background I’m an expat, posted in Thailand for several years, then to Beijing and then back to Thailand. My ex is a very wealthy Thai girl who was a university student at the best school in Thailand when we were dating and had just graduated when we broke up. We broke things off because I was moving to China. It wasn’t an awful breakup but there were definitely some hard feelings on her end. Honestly I felt bad myself. She’s absolutely gorgeous and very smart and we had a lot of fun together. This was 3 years ago. I  

This wasn't several years later, but my ex and I broke up in 2016, I joined the military in 2018 and started my current relationship Dec 2018, at this point my ex had completely removed me from all social media and we had had no contact in almost 2 years. A few months into 2019 I moved 600 miles away for work, but my girlfriend stayed. So being the one who made more money I traveled to her when I could. She was in college so I would attend her classes with her and participate in class discussions, since I had nothing better to do. Surprisingly on the way to one of her classes I saw my ex walking 

I was with someone on and off for two years back in 2014. At the tail end of 2014, I sent him (Let’s call him Pete*) an email (which is how he broke up with me twice during those two years) explaining that I knew I wanted more from him than he wanted and that the last two years I had been lying to myself thinking he would magically become the person I wanted him to be. I told him that I loved him and that I always would. I ended the email by asking him not to reply because I didn’t want to re-read his email over and over again as it would be too painful for me. He obliged. I had seen him in pas 

When my ex and I broke up in 2014, we were still in love. My mother decided she didn’t approve of our relationship, so we were forced to split at the age of 14 and I was moved to a different town. She shipped me off to my hometown in FL for the summer and turned off my phone service so that i could not have contact with said ex. I even tried mailing letters, but my aunt took them out of the mailbox and told my mother about it. When I came back to TN, I was brought back home 3 different times at the age of 15 for taking my mother’s car in the middle of the night as I was attempting to see him aga 

I have either accidentally or on purpose encountered all my exes several years or even several lifetimes after we parted because of reincarnation, or the ebb and flow of all living things. For example, my Husband No. 2 passed away some years ago. However, in some of my dreams or nightmares he appears as my mother. My husband No. 1 was my brother in previous lifetimes. After all the romance faded, we were siblings and/or best friends. These other examples aren’t exes, at least in this current lifetime, but my daughter has been my sister in several lifetimes. This is a very strong connection becaus 

Yes, and it was hilarious! After 5 years of dating, and 14 years of marriage, my Ex finally realized that I would not ever allow her to be in complete control, and said that she “wanted out of the marriage”. After a semi-nasty divorce that took 6 months, and another 2 months for me to find a new home, I went on my way. Since we did not have kids, it would be a clean break. (Although I did essentially raise her son from her first marriage, but that’s another story) I moved to a new home about 6 miles away. About 2 years later she showed up at my door unannounced (and most definitely uninvited) to 

How do I get over a narcissist ex and his new supply?
Is it really true that moving on with your life is the best revenge on a narcissistic ex? I’ve been trying for months, but still think of him daily and wish he would text me as I miss him, though I know he’s bad for me. When will this pass?
Absolutely true that moving on and making something of your life really is the best revenge of the lot. Why? Because this is not what they want. What they really want to see or hear of is you sitting by the phone pining for their call or pouring your heart out on social media about how much they are missed. Does nothing to shake them from your system but sure does wonders for their ego. Narcissists just love to know when they are being craved. Your doing your cold turkey and take heart, it wont last. Most ex partners sometimes cross or minds or enter our dreams so nothing unusual about that but 

I ask myself the same thing. At first I was determined to move on asap. I put a lot of energy and determination into moving forward in a positive meaningful way. Now 5 months on, things feel stalled. There have been many ups and downs and setbacks, the recovery certainly isn't linear. I think a lot of it, if not all of it is down to what is going on in my own head. I also think the global situation and it being winter has not helped at all. I feel just as isolated now as I did 5 months ago. I have also not been able to yet recoup the financial losses from the relationshit. I had lost a lot of 'f 

I came out of the relationship 6 months ago and still think of him everyday. Not in the same way, I don't love him anymore but I do miss the good we had. But I just have to remind myself that he isn't the person I thought he was. Unfortunately, I have to see him in work everyday and it's a completely different person to who I thought he was, it's quite shocking. You miss the comfort, the company, someone having your back and being on your side, someone who gets you and accepts you. At least that's what I miss in my ex but you've got to remember that it was not real. Even when people break up t 

Here's some advice from someone who has a serious case of OCD, not just the stereotypical OCD people joke about: I think if you look at it as revenge, you can't move on. You cared about someone, and it doesn't matter who they are, you cared. So revenge to me seems like going against your instincts which to me seems it would make things harder to move on. Right this down or save it on your phone: “Sometimes you need to forget what you feel and remember what you deserve.” I don't know who said it, but I read it somewhere and it hit me hard. It's true though. You can care about someone, but if you loo 

Yes moving on with your life letting him know by showing him that you're not phased by The Break-Up , you don't have time for his b******* and you're too busy with your friends &amp; your life is the best revenge When I was going through that phase of constantly wanting to talk to him ,go and see him , spend time with him, what I did was wrote a checklist in my head of all those things he did or said that I did not like and this would deter me from going I didn't enjoy being controlledI didn't like being isolated from Friends for family because you felt threatened that they would advise me to leaveI

The narcy I have been in no contact with for three weeks is a complete loser and there is nothing worse than having an enemy who is a total loser. It's incredibly frustrating when seeking revenge against one because you come to the realization that there is really nothing you can do to make the person's life worse than it already is. They have nothing to take, there is no way to screw them over if you have been their victim. They have already screwed themselves over. But I am not a vengeful person, I believe revenge and cruelty, are only the striking expression, last act and desperation of defe 

Sadly, you miss the fake side. The side that was used to keep you under control and of use. I remember when with my ex I would cry that I missed the man I first met. How he had completely changed and I felt like he was someone else and the man I met had died. I've now realised the man I first met was a dream, a mask, an act. It was all fake and he never existed. I've been no contact for over a year. He's attempted to contact me 3 times in total… all in the last 3/4 months. My boyfriend replied the last time with a bit of a threat and indicating that I've moved out of the country, so there is no p 

As long as you feel you have no other options, you are hypnotized by the narcissist as they wanted you to be. Because you are an object, and not even one of desire anymore… You are an object (no longer shiney and new) they will play with til you're dead. Like a snake and little mouse in its stare. Narcissists are creatures who don't give a $#@ about you. They are ALL ABOUT THEMSELVES. Do you love yourself more than you “love" the narc? If the answer is no, that is the place to begin. When you start to heal is when you learn to put yourself as a priority (over the narc). You've been TRAINED to p 

first, you dont really need revenge. these guys self revenge. when i headed my ex off and ditched him, i knew he was such a fuckup that the only thing me trying revenge would do is make me look like it was a critical matter and it wasnt. he was floored that i wasnt “mad” enough to kill him. he was not in danger at all. and sure enough, despite whoever hes fucking, hes back here every 4 months to try to scoop up info. my responses to him are flat and matter of fact. i told him im not his friend and i prove it. but hes stuck on it being unjust of me to label him whore. quietly. only when he asks…m

Has an ex from years ago ever contacted you 'out of the blue'? What did they want?
It wasn’t years ago at the time. Her name wasn’t Jessica, but it will do for here. I met Jessica online because I’ve always been socially awkward, and have a hard time meeting people randomly in real life settings. We had great conversations online, and texted frequently, and when I first met her in person she did something odd to me that instantly put me at ease. I’ve always been hesitant about being aggressive, so I tend to keep a respectful gap between me and anyone who might be uncomfortable. She walked right up to me and invaded my personal space, nearly chest bumping me, which told me sh 

Oh my god yes and it was so funny when he did (not a haha funny but a wtf you're crazy funny) I dated this guy in my senior year of highschool.. I was 19 and he was 21 and already out of highschool obviously (I was expelled from school in 9th grade and had failed 3rd grade hence why I was 19 and still in highschool- my home life wasn't easy so at the time school was the least of my concerns). We dated for about half a year. 2 months in I was at his house hanging out with him and his parents then randomly their doorbell rang… his mom answered it and then she came back into the living room holdin 

Several years ago I happened to find a Facebook message from an old boyfriend, a boyfriend I hadn't seen or heard from for 16 years. I didn't see the message for almost 9 months after it was sent because it was in a “spam” or “other" folder. He had written some nonsense about how he “just happened” to be watching some videos and -- whoa! -- saw my very familiar face! (I had in fact acted in a promotional product video for a foreign inventor who was in my country for a trade show at the time, but the product video was so niche that there was no way this ex happened to be browsing these videos,  

Yes… It’s happened to me several times over the years. One very recently. Each time was a bit different but basically the same theme. EX SAYS: “I’m sorry for how I was and if I hurt you blah blah blah,” Then the real reason makes itself clear. EX IS REALLY SAYING : “ I got my heart broken by somebody else and you were always there for me and would have never treated me this way. And now I need to talk to someone who will boost my ego and put me back together so I can face the world again” I often obliged them with what they wanted or the moral support they needed. But I have only taken one EX back i 

It’s strange how the universe works sometimes.

The problem was I was still living in the same house as my wife as she was flip flopping about moving out, I suppose if anything we were on and off at this point, I told her I’ve met some else, she hit the roof and low and behold she wanted me back! Threatened to kill her self if I left her. I took her back, purely because for the 1st time in a year I could she she actual 

Warning-Horror Story ahead. I’m m a man and not long ago had an ex-girlfriend contact me about 10 times using fake accounts on either Facebook and or Instagram. These messages were always the same and were threatening my career and my personal safety. I decided to ignore everything and take the higher road. I always knew it was her but of course could never prove it. Did I mention I’m in my 40’s? And so is she… Anyway, I ignored her for years and got myself into another relationship and moved on. The straw that broke the camels back is she decided to contact my mother. My mother kept this from me 

Yes. Pretty much shoking and unusual. My ex boyfriend contacted me via LinkedIn in the begining of 2019, and I haven't seen him since 2004. We live in the same city, about 600.000 inhabitants total, including the perifery zone villages. He was my only ex boyfriend. Our relationship was meant to be because his origins are partially similar with mine. But actually we were everything but a normal couple. We never lived together or engaged. We were always like ‘will and grace’. Some of his friends would always be there. We tried and it didn't work out. So we didn't give much sacrifice to make it h 

Not really an ex but an old best friend I was in love with at 19. He was so sweet and we were just too young and immature - and just drunk every weekend together! I made it clear for years how much I wanted him in my life and was ignored constantly and let down. I heard through Facebook about things that had happened - he had been in the Army, discharged due to an incident then lost his fiancé (who I used to go out on nights out with) in a car accident! I never contacted him as I had been made to stay out of his life by my current partner for at least 5 years so it seemed inappropriate! 12 years l 

This wasn’t exactly an ex but rather someone that expressed they had feelings for me way back in middle school. I am now moved in with my boyfriend that I am planning to marry. We are super tight and ever since a year ago I post him occasionally and people see it, including my exes. We both are from the same city (where we also met) and together moved out of the state. I got a new phone in the process and only gave the number out to my closest friends and family. One day while I was in the car with my boo I receive a strange text from a phone that had my old home’s area code: “Hey [my name].” Me: 

Yes. I didn't even know or recognize the number. I answered and said “Hello". There was one word “John?” followed by a long pause. I was trying to place the voice. It was familiar. I answered yes and then a few questions followed. Are you happy? Do you know who this is? Is it ok if I call you? Still trying to place the voice when it hit me who it was. I told her to slow down then asked what was wrong. She told me she had made a terrible mistake and proceeded to explain a lot of things that happened in the past. I listened and her conversation brought a lot of things back from memory. The infor 

Why after ten months of no contact do I still think about her? I have done a good job of moving on but sometimes memories pop up out of nowhere and the hurt returns. I still love this person, and I don’t for the life of me know why.
Why my ex narc reached me out asking how I was after 4 months telling me he doesnt expect anything from me ? Is this a hoover and manipulating? He followed all the textbook narc pattern before discading me last may.
To begin with, your ex discarded you last may, and is now in touch with you, then yes that is a form of hoovering. The narcissist has asked how you are, but do you not realise that allowing this behaviour to happen is going to constantly play with your mind? Narcissist love to play mind games and this is one way of getting a reaction from you, if you respond to them, the narcissist then has proof that you are still interested in them and this is a big boost to their ego. Rebuild your life and the first most important thing you must do is to go no contact completely with him. Block phone number/ e 

It may be a hoover, … an actual attempt to ‘woo’ (after a fashion), you back, … or it may simply be one of many forms of ‘messing with you.’ He is likely checking to determine how much control/power he still seems to have over you. He is checking on your response to his voice and manipulations. (He wants to know how badly you may want him back; thus, how quickly you would be available, should he need you (maybe he isn’t having great luck with finding/keeping replacement supply, and maybe he hasn’t paid his rent this month, and may need a place to crash in a few nights - if not sooner). There are 

It’s absolutely a hoover. If you answer the lying and manipulating will continue. That’s exactly what happened with me. I finally felt that despite my feelings for this person I had to block for my health. I knew it just had to be ended. So i made a decision. And i knew it had to be ended completely. Whether they want to be or not, narcs are just hurtful people. They hurt people to have control over them. Whatever the reason it’s just what they do and it’s not right at all. And it’s impossible for an honest person to live with. Impossible. Especially now that you know what they are. The narc w 

Narcissists feed on your insecurity. Anything they can do to increase your insecurity validates their power. Unable, or unwilling to take pleasure from their own achievements, the narcissist is invigorated by downplaying, devaluing and destroying yours. Tell him “I only expect things from myself nowadays. My own expectations are at much higher standard. I'm pleased with my progress and have achieved things I consider mine.” Using so many personal pronouns will both destabilize and enrage him. Ignore his rage, it is his feeding tube, his proboscis flailing around, seeking a vein. Never ever use the 

Oh, a textbook hoover- your narc ex is really following the narc instruction manual. He hopes you still have feelings, and he hopes that by telling you up front he wants nothing from you it will imply he knows he behaved badly, but you will respond, and that opens the way to manipulation. This guy knows you, so he knows how to manipulate you, so preapre to be played like a fiddle, then dropped again as soon as he has had what he needs. He does want something from you, or else he would not make contact. Unless you relish the thought of more pain in your life, block him and do not respond. Get o 

Yes. This is a hoover. Yes. This is manipulation. This too is part of the textbook narc pattern. No. It does expect things from you. What? you ask..? It expects you to entertain its hoover.It expects you to not ask any questions.It expects you to still treat it as Gods gift to humankind.It expects you to keep enduring its abuse.It expects you to stop “bringing up the past".It expects you to take the blame for all of its misconducts.It expects you to trust it with all your heart.It expects you to forgive its upcoming cheating.It expects you to never get tired of its sh*t.It expects you to be gratef

Your heart skipped several beats too, I imagine, when they contacted you again. DON’T FALL FOR IT! - You are being hoovered, just to be dropped very quickly and painfully all over again. I hope you have not responded at all. Please don’t. Please take care of yourself, fill your life with activities and other people, even if only on a superficial level, and try not to focus on this person. And have no doubts that you will have been one of several people he ‘reached out’ to - and probably is already love-bombing an unsuspecting person. Time is the most valuable thing we have, use it well, and not a  

Yeah - notice the immediate ambiguity: "Hi - just thinking about you. Hope you're doing okay but I don't want or need you particularly. Please reassure me that you still hurt - I need that, but don't think that I need anything from you." Basically he's making sure you don't know where you stand, as narcissists do, while extracting what he can. In my case it was "You're not worth my time - please just go away.

He is still following the narcissist “text book”, he is Hoovering you, in an effort to get a response. He is testing you to see if you will bite. What ever you do, do not contact him. By the way why haven’t you blocked him? If you have, then how did he reach out to you? If he found a hole in your block, block him again. This is a warning, the second time you go back the abuse will be worse. It will get worse each time you go through this emotional Merry-Go-Round of discard, hoover and go back. 664 views · View upvotes · View shares · Answer requested by Claire Eleanor2513Adam Price, 3 year intimate relationship with a covert narcissistAnswered 6 months ago · Author has 321 answers and 117.7K answer views

Why can't I move on? I’m deeply in love with my ex even though she’s made it clear she’s done. I'm terribly jealous and find myself checking her social media, texting, and calling. How do I get the closure I need?
Have you ever rekindled with an ex who broke up with you and how did you do that?
Answer to the first part of this question is YES, I have rekindled with my ex. BUT it was ME who broke up with her. As to how did I do that, so this is somewhat non-traditional and may offend some people. Before beginning the story of How I rekindled with her. Let me give you a brief about us and our relationship pre-breakup. We were in a relationship for 6 long years and it was my longest relationship so far. So I have some kind of unintended tendency to mess good things that are happening in my life and then cribbing about only the bad things happening to me. So the relationship was something l 

Yes, I did, and I guess knowing what I know now, I wish that we hadn’t gotten back together all of those times. But you asked how I did it, so I will tell you. The first time we broke up was because of something I did. It happened at the start of December in 2010. We had only been together for a year and some months. After the break up, I was very upset, but I knew that I had deeply hurt him, so I tried to move on while giving him his space. However, I still loved him and wanted to be with him, so I tried to see if there was a way that I could win him back. I eventually found a program that offe 

I’ve rekindled relationships with a few exes. Truth be told, it was rather simple once I got over my pride. After going a while without talking, we literally and unexpectedly bumped into each other while at a social gathering. The sheer surprise look on both our faces made it painfully obvious. We exchanged pleasantries before moving to separate sides of the function to ensure we didn’t bump into each other again. A couple days later I reached out to her. I sent her a simple message that said something on the lines of “It was nice (and surprising) running into you the other night. You were tota 

Yes and 2+ years after rekindling, we are still going strong. But let me tell you what happened. First of all, I was the one who broke up and the one who asked her back. We dated from September 2015 to July 2016, when I ended things. We didn't fight, I didn't hate her and she didn't hate me, but things weren't good for me: I was trying to get comfortable with my sexuality, I had started therapy because of an anxiety disorder and she was battling depression. All in all, a really bad period of my and her life. Because of all of that combined, I felt I needed some time alone to find where I stood i 

Yes. You have to approach each situation differently. the first time I had rekindled it was with a high school sweet heart. We got back together five years after we graduated. But as much of a friend as he was it felt like it was just too nice and easy of a relationship. Too much agreeing. Too much his mom in our relationship. It ended. He just found another woman and married her a year later, because mom wanted him too. the second time it happened was with a gentleman that comes and goes when things get rough. It started as a crush, moved in the right direction but wrong time. We tried to hol 

Yes. We met in high school, I was a senior and she was junior. She used to sit right next to me in class and I didn’t care about here because I was in “love” with someone else. I found out through a mutual friend she likes me so I decided to get to know her because my “love” didn’t love me back. I asked her out and we walked to Mcdonald’s For our first date. We were together for around 3 months before summer came and I graduated and she became a senior. During summer she went to another state and found some guy over there (I didn’t know this at the time) and she broke up with me. I was heart b 

This is a tough one for me. My first wife died leaving me with four-and three-year-old boys and a 30-day old infant daughter. This was in 1970 when single men rarely were raising very young children alone. Several years went by during which time I dated many, many women. It seems at that time a man who was raising young children alone was attractive to some women. Eventually, I met a single woman with a son who was enchanting (meaning: Amazing in Bed.) We dated and eventually married. Several years later the marriage was falling apart, so we separated. Like a yoyo, it wasn’t long before we bot 

Yes, we had been broken up and had no contact for 2 years. We were both eachother’s first love and it did not take long for a simple “what's up” text to turn into a relationship. It was great at first, we both knew eachother's history as well as shared romantic history. We spent a lot of time catching up, but we moved fast also. We were not as hesitatant to be physical and move bases because we had already done it before. Though being comfortable with eachother was great, we knew who eachother had been not who the person we with actually was. We had both changed and had become emotionally attach 

yes , we broke up at year 3 , she left, then she left again at year 8 , i thought over and over why she would of done what she did. but being split up gave me time to reflect, and now i know what i was doing wrong, whether it be the reason she left or not. i lived OUR life like a chess board. always worried about next move, rent, always planning for the future, never really travelling or doing things we always wanted to do , not willing to take on my exes debts too. i had everything planned out. and i expected her to full-fill her roll instead of being a just my love and best friend. i guess the 

Yes, but it was the biggest mistake of my life. He told me he “loved me” and he was ready for something serious, I literally left everything for him ONLY because he reassured me that he would have my back. I take FULL responsibility for believing him. Literally two weeks after moving in with him and finally settling into his home, he tells me he isn’t used to living with someone else and he wants to be able to “be himself “ and do his own thing again. Can you imagine what Was going through my head when he said that to me??! I was wondering what the hell did I do that made him “not be himself”.  

How did my narcissistic ex just move on like I was nothing?
What is the best way to get over your ex?
Time and distance. I know this feeling. It's not fun. It hurts, and it will hurt for a long time. The only thing that will negate it is your willingness to move on. It wont be easy, but it can be done. Stay away from him. I'm talking deleting number, unfriending and blocking on all social media. Cut the contact. Make sure you take away your temptation to contact him. We all have our moments of weakness, but that does not mean you have to act on. Plus, it will save your dignity.Grieve. Cry when you feel the need to. No one likes to cry, but getting those tears out will help you release those feel

There's a lot of good advice here but I understand it's not easy, the guy is in your head, you loved him and he split with you meaning you weren't ready for all of this and to add insult to injury he's now sleeping with someone else, so I get it and it's on your mind constantly. So let's talk about a plan. A plan that is going to get your little ship steady and set you back on the road again. I know it sucks. You are thinking you're not good enough, you're thinking you were going to spend the rest of your life with this guy, I bet you even talked about that right, I bet the sex was good too, an 

I remember when my ex left me by text after 5 years this February. After daily contact there was suddenly nothing. She was “polite” enough to respond to messages but I’d spend my time watching and waiting to hear from her. She was my waking thought and the reason I couldn’t sleep. Work was difficult as the memory of her permeated throughout the day. I loaded up sad songs and had constant thoughts of regret. What if? If only? Maybe she’ll change her mind? She just needs time…. I kept busy. Tried to learn a musical instrument and a new language. Took up yoga. Met new people. All helped “distract” 

I’m going to let you on a big secret everyone keeps lying about. It’s only after they have had a lot to drink do they self disclose. Most people are not over someone 1 year, 5 years, 10 years and even 20 years later. The scientific reason why you are not over the ex is your repetitive thoughts have ingrained the self pity feeling over and over again like a deep grooved bicycle trail hoping to experience something over the numbness. Then when you take another trail (thought), your mind falls back into that deep groove you’ve carved out over the last year. Nothing etches something into our brain li 

This question has been answered a thousand times on Quora. You know why, because we ALL have been in your shoes. You dated someone and fell in love. You have so many memories. You have a pattern with them (talk on the phone every night, hung out on weekends, they used to tease the way you laugh, every 4th of July you guys went to the beach or amusement park, etc.). You have a collection of gifts your ex bought you during the relationship. All of the sudden, the ex is gone. You no longer have that person in your life. You're home alone on the weekends.

When we experience heartbreak or a breakup, all we want is to stop feeling the pain. We seek to stop feeling their absense. We desire to forget them completely. However, sadly, we can’t completely erase someone from our memory. Especially someone who meant a lot to us. If someone had invented a quick and easy cure for heartbreak, they would probably be the wealthiest person in the world. You wish to stop thinking about your ex. And maybe you’ve tried, but you can’t, and it makes you to just want to rip our hair out or punch a wall. Get rid of anything connected to them.This is probably the most  

I assume you mean you think about him all the time and you have feelings of sadness. I can tell you that a breakup is a loss, the death of a relationship and the hopes and dreams that go along with it. The loss may bring grief, depending upon how much you had invested in the relationship, which can develop into depression if it goes on too long. There are some things you can do to help yourself. First, admit the relationship wasn’t perfect and figure out what happened AND THE ROLE YOU PLAYED which contributed to the breakup. No one just suddenly stops loving another so it either never existed o 

This is a very difficult thing for anybody to go through, but you can lessen your pain and speed up recovery significantly by doing the following things; You need space from your ex to relieve tensions and the intensity of the breakup.Go No Contact for 1–2 months, which involves no texting, no calling, no emails, and absolutely no stalking their social media. It’s hard but if you don’t do this you’re only deepening your emotional wounds and complicating your recovery.You have to believe that this person was not right for you. That’s why you aren’t together.Stop idealising this person. This is a

How can I stop myself from missing and loving my ex?
If someone had told me that “it’s better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all” when I was going through the heartache of trying to emotionally detach from someone that I loved, I think I would have felt like slapping them. I didn’t want to love him! It hurt too much! Years later, I do actually get it! You see, what I came to find, is that love is what’s inside of you - it never really is about the other person. Detaching from someone that you gave your heart to, is a process. It truly is a journey of self discovery, but if you are prepared to do the work, it can lead you to a 

I know it is hard and I was in similar position many times. My answer based on my experience. Metaphorically speaking, running is not pleasant but it is healthy. This means, as soon you start forgetting, you will start healing and feeling better. The main objective is to forget and run from the thoughts. One of the best qualities of the humans is that they forget things. Time and positive changes in your life are the keys. In order to achieve this, you have to destroy everything that remember your ex. Delete his/her number, unfriend from all social media, delete pictures and conversations. Avoid p 

It sounds like you are going through a tough time. You can't just stop feeling those feelings. It would be convenient if you could, but you can't, so don't beat yourself up more than you have to. It is natural to miss someone when they leave your life. You loved them before and that feeling doesn't go away. It does get less pressing, and over time it becomes a happy memory, but that all takes time. For now, when you feel sad, go ahead and feel sad. It's ok. At the same time, it is helpful to try to change your focus. You can't "not think about" anything. Trying to "not think about" them is thin 

Love is one of the best feelings in the world and it’s really hard to get rid of someone you love post breakup, coz it’s all about the good things that happened between you guys which will chase you even though you’re with someone and somewhere else. post breakup everything changes and it feels like your life is not the way it was and you start stalking your ex on social media- seeing her status updates and checking if she is checking your updates and it’s a never ending process!!! First and foremost thing to keep in mind is she is your ex or you’re her ex for a reason!! let’s highlight this reas 

You already know the answer to your question. But you don’t want to do the things that need to be done, so you are asking strangers on the internet what they think. I cannot promise to end your sadness, but you CAN end your suffering. This idea that he/she is still thinking about you and missing you is a fantasy. A fantasy relationship is easier to have than a real relationship. In our imaginations, the unattainable person has all of the traits that we want in a mate. Real flesh and blood people can never measure up. There is no happy ending to this sad path you are currently on. Walk away from this 

I completely understand what you going through. I would love to give you some advice other way round. ASK YOURSELF AN EMPOWERING QUESTION. You have already done that by asking this question but ask yourself one more empowering question like HOW CAN I TURN THINGS AROUND? or HOW CAN I UTILIZE THIS MOMENT PRODUCTIVELY? If you ask such questions to yourself with emotional intensity you can get better answers. Secondly, relationships always take some part of our lives. Now that you are single why not utilize this moment for self improvement and self expansion. How about being a better person? Also I 

You don’t stop yourself from missing them or loving them. Why? Because it’s part of the grieving process. Because it’s okay to be in that place for a while. Because my mind wants to stay there reminiscing some good, some cathartic, memories for a while. I respect that, today my thoughts want to flow for a while, because it’s okay to miss them. You don’t wake up suddenly, one fine morning, with a feeling of hatred for your ex. You might think that you’re well over them only to find yourself pouting about how you can’t listen to a song without thinking about them. Every separation is hurtful- doesn’t 

The void that someone you loved has left takes effort and courage to fill. Try to do some of the things that is recommend after break up but in the end it's only you who can help yourself. Erase memories To overcome this you have to remove every picture or memory of the ex. Have fun with friends I have seen people sulk after break up. That's what bringing in the negative energy. Go out with friends to movie, amusement park and have a loads of fun. Flirt Start flirting with others after you feel you are ready this will help you a lot. Stop listening to those sad songs It's a proven fact that mood change 

Honestly? Take control of your own emotions and feelings, you control them, they don’t control you. I split from my partner of 11 years just 10 weeks ago. My biggest bit of advice is stay busy, hit the gym, meet new people and be open to new experiences. Start dating again with no intentions of anything because its when you least expect things to happen that the greatest things do. Getting over your ex is a process, but it can be accelerated by being logical about everything. Move on, stop wasting the precious amount of time we have on this planet. 2.3K views · View upvotes22Falcon Black, YouTuber at Falcon Black - Self Refinement (2018-present)Answered 7 months ago

If you broke up over something silly (ie anything that isn’t cheating)… then you’re probably going to kick yourself for a long time. And the pain will be enduring when you realise the grass isn’t greener on the other side. Problem with modern society is that we are entrained to leave relationships at the drop of a hat: with the current divorce rates, why even get married? Social media amongst many things create the illusion of having ““many options” - when in reality, as human beings we do not really PAIRBOND with many people. flings and rebounds won’t help either - the contrary, it will remind  

How do you know if your ex thinks of you?
How do you know if your ex thinks of you? I didn't give my ex a thought for the past fifty years. That would have been my high school/college boyfriend of eight years, then husband for the Year from Hell. Let’s call him Terry. But I recently discovered that he’d been thinking of me. We broke up for good in 1968. I forgave both him and myself as I grew into a more healthy adulthood and led the beautiful life that was meant for me. Fast forward to 2018 when I received a lengthy private Facebook message from Terry (he must have found me using my original surname), reminiscing about our years together  

Your ex thinks of you. All exs think of exs. I love this question because it opens up something people rarely talk about. Perhaps it is the darkest side of all this hooking up and breaking up. This darkness has to do with the process of moving on after it is over with someone. Maybe this is me being too much of a poet, but there was love (maybe just on one side) and now there is a pretend game. We pretend that the love was not important; now that the relationship is over, we pretend that the love is not still alive in every cell of our bodies; we pretend we are machines that can program out som 

I don't think there is any way to know 100% for sure if your ex still thinks of you unless you’re still in contact to some degree. Obviously if they reach out to you on occasion even if it's just to wish you a Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas they thought of you, but even in these cases it doesn't necessarily mean that they miss you or think of you romantically. Some exes may even think of you often but only negatively and harbor resentment. I think what many people have written here is both sweet and endearing, for the most part. In my honest opinion however, I feel it does not reflect the ma 

I suppose there’s no way you can know if your ex thinks of you unless you ask. And how weird would that be? “Hey, you’re not by chance thinking of me right now, are you? Okay, how ’bout in the past month? Year—?” (Gentle smile) It stands to reason that if I think of my exes from time to time, they also think of me from time to time—well, most of them. Sometimes someone just pops into your head for no reason, or you find a letter, card, or old photograph of the two of you that you’d forgotten existed. I don’t have many terrible exes that I want to forget. Some weren’t very memorable because the r 

I just got off the phone with my ex girlfriend, although I prefer the term former girlfriend. Unfortunately she was recently in a car accident (don’t worry she was unhurt) and she was updating me on how the replacement car shopping was going now that the at fault driver’s insurance finalized everything. She also wanted me to know that she called my mom for her birthday and wished her the best one possible. You see, when we date someone, seriously, for any amount to time we leave an impression on them. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. Hopefully good though. If the relationship ended on good terms, it 

Jo, my last and hopefully final ex, whom I kicked out 20 years ago, came very close to obliterating me entirely. Emily Fisher's answer to Have you ever been in trouble for something your significant other dreamt about? She is the only ex with whom I did not maintain contact — let alone a friendship. I don’t have very many exes, but all the other ones are still my friends, so I know when they’re thinking of me because they say so. Jo, on the other hand — it’s usually due to revived curses that I know she’s thinking of me, and that’s far too big a tale to inject here, so I’ll just tell you about t 

My last ex doesn’t count. He called me at 7:45 this morning to tell me something inane about Paul McCartney and Wings. He owes me money. Damn right, he thinks about me. The one before that…probably tries not to. The one before that, I’ve known since we were kids. We were friends for a decade before we became a couple. It ended badly (It always does) and he went a little nuts - no, he went a lot crazy and scared me. He scared a number of people. I’m known in certain circles (and not fondly) as the girl who broke his heart. I’m friendly with most of my exes. Not best friends, mind you…It took years  

I have one Big Ex and a collection of mini exes. I assume they think about me, at least here and there. After all, if you have an ex it means you once had something serious. Big Ex occasionally leaves presents. One day a Fleshlite appeared in my mailbox, (granted, that was a weird one) another time he included me in a family Art Museum membership. He’s in the middle of a ball-busting relationship from Planet WTF so none of us see him often. A while ago I was having coffee with a friend— “I just saw Nile, he bought you this.” Before me sat a small white bag. I dove in. It was a collection of seeds, 

In my case, she thought of me so much it was unhealthy. We were on again/off again for two years. During one of our breaks I got a random friend request on Facebook that came with a message. I prefer those honestly so I accepted Julia Douglas’s private message. My ex and I weren’t talking because I needed time away from her to allow myself to think about our relationship and what had been going on between us. I spoke to Julia almost daily about the typical how was your day, what do you like to do for fun, etcetra. Something kept nagging me that I was talking to someone who was oddly way too si 

I'll give a recent example: I used to see this guy for…well damn, it might be over a year? Now that I think of it. We never became official, though I wanted it, loved him, told him and pretty much got a lot of uncertain answers. Eventually I came to my senses and realized if he doesn't want me, I can't force him so I will look for someone who does want me. It's since been another year or so. Since I've got a new boyfriend and we live together and are very happy. Wouldn't dream of leaving him for anything because I am satisfied. Got a friend request from the “ex”. I pondered it. Eventually accepted 

When things ended with my narcissistic ex, I did what I was supposed to do; walk away, left our shared social group, stopped all contact etc. It’s been 5 months since then and he hasn’t hoovered. This shocked and hurt me deeply. Why do I still care?
What was your "point of no return" with your ex?
 I am Australian and I was backpacking around the world in 1989–1990. In the North American summer months of 1989 I was lucky enough to get a short stint as a movie extra in Calgary Canada. I met another extra on set early into the shoot and I was smitten. She was a pretty Calgarian and we hit it off from the get go, in fact the other extras nicknamed us Romeo and Juliet. After the shoot wrapped up I stayed as long as I could but suddenly had to move on quickly (that's another story). Not wanting to be apart from each other she flew out and met me in London to join me in my travels. We travell 

I found out my boyfriend caught up with his ex behind my back. He always told me he wanted to catch up with her for closure which was okay for me. But when he did he did it behind my back I knew it was not just a closure thing. And that was not even my point of no return yet. When he came to visit me in my town for a couple weeks (we were in a long distance relationship at the time but planning to close the distance) I started recognising that he was very secretive about his phone sometimes. At some point I figured out that it happened whenever his ex girlfriend’s name showed up on his screen.  

This is a long one so apologies in advance. He wasn’t an “ex” Per se, but someone I was seeing and someone I could see myself with, I really really liked him and I really liked us together. But apparently we didn’t share the same vision. What we had was a whirlwind situationship. We went to galleries and exhibitions together as we are both creative people, and normal dates like the pub, the cinema etc and I loved how much we had in common and how well we just fit together. I have quite bad luck when it comes to relationships so it finally felt like my luck had changed and I may have met someone  

I was born in California but moved to Mexico with my mother and sister when I was young. My father was a very complicated man so my sister and I had few contact with him (he stayed in California). All my family is very educated and my mother is a wonderful person who raised my sister and I very well. I grew up in the upper middle class but was never spoiled, I always knew the value of things and understood the consequences of my actions. My father got really sick and my sister and I went to California to see him, he eventually passed away and I had recently graduated collage. I had to deal wit 

One night I got off work and stayed out in the parking lot talking on the phone. I was talking to one of my co workers, (work related stuff) and during that my boyfriend who is now my ex since that night kept calling and texting. I was writing stuff my co worker was telling me in my notes app in my phone. We were having some issues with our shipment so we had to remake our work schedule. My ex was going to go to the movies with his friends that night and I just so happen to work right across the street from the theater. He knew I was working and knew I was off because I texted him back letting 

Yesterday morning I was in court for the “Final Settlement”, where the judge decides how to distribute marital assets. My STBX wife has promised to destroy me, threatening to “take me to the cleaners”. So I wasn't exactly having the best morning when my barrister told me that the judge tends to be biased in favour of the wives in a settlement. The final moment came when STBX demanded a £17,000 lump sum, roughly £6000 from my pension, AND for me to have my house re-valued at roughly £10,000 more than it's currently worth. She expected to walk out of the courts with in excess of £30,000 in her paw 

I’ve been married for 14 years to my ex I will call Renee. She enjoyed the benefits of being married to a retired military veteran knowing the bills were paid. She had the freedom to enjoy what she wanted to do with her salary. One of my friends, Mark from high school and his wife, started associating with us for several holiday gatherings and more. One evening I walked into the kitchen and noticed my friend and my wife talking together very close (face to face) and when he saw me he jumped back as if in shock of being caught. I smiled, played it off and kept it in the back of my mind. From tha 

When I read his conversation with a friend about how he got together with someone else’s girlfriend. That day, I decided she was his perfect match, not me. This was the guy I had known since we were kids. We grew up together, we were friends first, we promised to always have each other’s back. Or so I thought. He dubbed me as his first greatest love. I finally reciprocated his feelings when we were at uni. My naiveness thought we were meant to be. We spent the next five years holding tight to a highly destructive and toxic relationship. He taught me love is an obsession and I took it as our love 

So, we had woken up on the weekend after another night of excuses as to why she wasnt in the mood to have sex. It had been years of being in this relationship where we would have sex maybe once a month. We would fight every few months because i would have a breakdown over the fact that she didnt want to have sex with me. I kept feeling like i was her room mate rather than her partner or lover. I woke up that morning and tried to give her a nice morning wake up by going down on her, she rejected me again. Naturally, I had another breakdown and we ended up fighting for almost the entire day. I wa 

Wow. That's going back a number of years now. Let me try to remember them all. We had 1 child. I was working 2 jobs because she hadn't while pregnant (a sore point as well) so when maternity leave arrived, she was making only about $100 a month from it. So basically nothing. I would come home and still have to make dinner, I would need to clean on the weekends. Half the time I would need to get up during the night to feed my daughter (she was formula fed as she couldn't breastfeed - she had reduction surgery many years earlier), do laundry, and clean the house on the weekends. I didn't mind getti 

How can I get my ex back when she won't talk to me or text me I wonder if I have the right number?
The opposite of love is not hate but indifference. When you try to reach out to your ex, she is not happy. She isn’t angry either. She just doesn’t care. She may laugh to herself that you are still hung up on her. She thinks “What a loser. He needs to get a life” And then she deletes or disposes of your message as if it were apiece of junk mail in her mailbox. She ignores it. She might even set up her computer to automatically delete messages from you unread. Or she might change her phone number or e-mail. She might block you on social medis. The point is she does not want to have you in her life  

I hear your heart ache. I have been there. In my case not with a girlfriend, but with my wife of 20 years. The question and answer are still the same. You need to change your question, or you will drive yourself crazy. Instead of asking “How can I get [person x] to do [action]?” You need to quit fighting the fact that you have no control over someone else. And even if you did have that kind of power and control over someone, the result would not be LOVE, and would not bring a HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP full of DEEP, FULFILLING INTIMACY, which is what we all want, right? Instead of trying to control/manip 

Well, you can get your ex back even he or she has refused to talk to you. In fact, you can get them to talk to you again. It isn’t really that hard. However, first, you need to figure out why your ex has stopped talking to you. Usually, people don’t really cut off communication with their partners lest they have a pretty solid reason for it such as infidelity or trying to move on. If you belong to the first category, then it would be really tough for you get your ex back. But, if the person is using ‘No Contact Rule’ so he or she can move on, then there is a high probability you two can unite a 

Sometimes just giving them some time helps. You can use the time to focus on yourself and improve yourself. “Abscense makes the heart grow fonder” and all that. Don't keep trying to get in touch every day as it just makes you look desperate, be cool and calm about it. If the person has totally ignored you for a good while then bear in mind that it's very possible that you can't get your ex back. There will be a reason, perhaps they just stopped liking you - whatever the reason, sadly, people can be really difficult and fickle (I think that's the term) and if they're like that you don't need em  

-You can’t,she is making her intentions clear with her ignorance,her actions speak louder.She is giving you a clear message of you don’t deserve my words so i’m giving you my silence(ignorance). -There is only 1 thing that you can do in this case which is waiting,if it was meant to be it will be.If you try to force things you will just hurt yourself and ruin everything,basically she is going to start losing respect for you,the harder you try to pull her close the more that she is going to push you,that’s how it goes.You can’t do anything,the more you beg/plead/cling or act needy the more she fe 

I’m going to start this off by stating that this is just my opinion, please do not get offended by what I think. I think that if your ex won’t talk to you the situation is one of two things: She is either a narcissist or is just mentally unstable and wants you to feel pain just because it brings her pleasure to watch you suffer.You did something wrong to deserve the break-up. In this case just forget about trying to get her back, you weren’t worth it to her anyway.However, if your situation is the first on the list, then I have a little advice for you…Yhink about how hurt you probably were whe 

You can't force someone who doesn't give a fuck to give a fuck; it never works out that way. Your ex is giving you a clear message that they don't want to be in your life, or at least for right now. Trying to force your ex to give you attention and love you, or forcing anybody to do that, is going to cause them to pull even further away from you. Instead of trying to gain their acceptance and appreciation, focus on accepting yourself and appreciating the people in your life who love and accept you. Don't live in the past and force someone to be in your life, and don't wait on them to be in your 

How do get a girl back who won't talk to me?… Should I go down to her and try talking face to face? For heaven’s sake, give the girl some space. You’ve upset her, now you are upsetting her again by pestering her, and are seriously considering going to see her uninvited. Some might call that harassment. I understand that you are remorseful and only want to make things right again. The way to do that is not to obsess and bother and cling and ask and beg. The way to do it is to think more about her than you do about your own embarrassment. Give her time and space to think about things. After some t 

From everything I’ve read, you keep working on you. You do what you need to do to fix what you can about yourself. You can’t change anything about the other person. Does that mean you’ll get them back? nope. But begging, pleading, bugging them won’t work either. Just treat them with respect, which right now means giving them space to figure what they want. This isn’t a bad thing. You can move on and hold space for them. If they come back, you can still care. In the meantime, live your life. And I mean LIVE. Do things. Try stuff you haven’t done. I go to comedy shows now, and I finally tried a zip 

Before you put all your energy into trying to get your Ex back… Why don’t you take that energy and focus all that attention on your own well-being/self, that’s when you will know if you really truly want your ex back. Another thing is too stop making yourself look needy and desperate for them to come back. Go completely no contact and spend time on yourself :) trust me you have got this like a pro. find new things to do , interests you never did with your ex. Go out and do everything your ex disliked doing. Spend time with your friends, family and make yourself busy but not too busy, learn to kn 

Will a narcissist come back again after going no contact? If yes, why exactly do they do it?
Once I'm blocked from an ex will they ever unblock me again? Will they miss me?
This is an incredibly important 2 part question for all you quorans to consider. (I can assure you quorans I know how very DIFFICULT it is in this situation through personal EXPERIENCE). What you must all do here is look at the situation LOGICALLY. Your EX has blocked you. This is as clear evidence as there could possibly be to inform you that the romantic relationship is definitely OVER. (Over and almost certainly going to STAY that way). Now that you have digested this harsh fact of life, what are you going to do? Are you really going to fret over whether you'll be unblocked or not? Let's say 

Once you are blocked by ur ex they may or may not unblock you again depends on their maturity level of understanding the truth…. often times people tend to think that if a person blocks someone it's because they don't care or hates the other person…it may be true if that person is a stranger and other person is annoying them, but if your ex blocked you that doesn't mean they don't give a fuck abt you, infact in most cases ur ex blocks you because they want to forget you and your memories faster so that they can get healed fast..and they block u because ur memories keep haunting them every sing

My ex of two years broke up with me. He called me everyday for about 3 months after the break up. Then he called (and sometimes I called him) about once or twice a week. He wanted to remain friends… or maybe we were just too attached to each other to completely leave each other alone. I met someone new two weeks after he broke up with me (wasn’t looking, just Gods timing I guess). 6 months after our breakup, I remember calling my ex three times because I had a bad day at work or was frustrated with life events. Just because the relationship ended, our emotional attachment of each other didn’t. 

If you’re asking these questions, then you’re not ready to be unblocked. Your ex blocked you for a reason. In my case, I blocked my ex because he kept wanting to text me every day and be besties. I was initially okay with being friends, but every few days, it would turn into him ranting and complaining and being upset about the breakup and wanting me to reassure him that he actually doesn’t suck and all that. Which was fine the first few times, but after months of pathetically seeking my approval and breaking boundaries in order to contact me, it was really getting on my nerves. I don’t have t 

Yes, they probably will at some point, depending on whether blocking you was justified. If your ex left you, or you caught them doing something they shouldn’t in a healthy relationship, then it is understandable that you felt upset and angry and maybe sent them messages and emails to show that. That’s normal behaviour and should be forgiven. But, if you were violent towards them or publicly threatening then they have every right to block you and leave it that way. At the moment your heart is broken and all you want is to be able to communicate with your ex, but stop and think for a while. Do y 

Contrary to what Tony says in caps, which means unhinged in written form: I block people often and unblock. I just need time of silence. Since I do this to friends and x's that are now friends I cannot answer if I blocked a new x and went back. If you want to be friends ignore this person for a few months. No emails and definitely never call from private number b/c it is creepy. Maybe after few months you can send email to see if they want to be friends but if they blocked and are male it shows extreme immaturity and I would move on. I'm female and block just to have a break from people that c 

Focus on your finances, start hitting the gym a few days per week, get a hobby or something that really catches your interest, go out with friends and have fun, sit down with yourself and take some time to reflect on any aspects of yourself you should improve, LEARN from what happened with this last relationship and improve on those things so next time you date someone else you’ll be less likely to make the same mistakes. will they miss me? Ehh fuck that, don’t even think about that shit. It ain’t relevant no more. They made a choice and u gotta deal with it, don’t like it? Too bad dude. Learn  

It depends on the reason that the ex had blocked u and what happened between u. The ex can block the other either cos she/he is too hurt and need some silence or time to move on without ur influence. Or she/he blocked u cos they r sure the relationship is over and dont want to be bothered anymore by u, neither want friendship. So it can be anything, we cant say if we dont know the full story. But if they blocked u cos they feel hurt then yea,probably they will miss u in the near future and maybe unblock u and talk to u again. Why do u care about ur ex in the first place. Do u want them back ?  

Once your ex blocks you that’s a big sign that they want nothing to do with you and that you need to leave them alone because chances are I’m going to assume that you wrote a bunch of messages pleading for them to come back or to talk to you which usually ends up in blocking. I will tell you if somebody truly loves you and wants to be in your life no obstacle will keep them away from that some thing to think about what the question that you just asked and exes an ex for a reason and the more that you hold on and become obsessed with being rejected basically you’re not gonna be able to move on  

I won’t lie- being blocked is bad. Without any knowledge of the situation you must ask yourself some questions… Have you been blocked before? Have they unblocked you before? If this is correct- it’s a pattern and with time you will probably get unblocked.If this hasn’t happened before- you need to completely back off. Don’t try and reach out in any way possible. Your ex is ‘telling’ you to back off. So give your ex space.I realize this sucks- but you need to focus on yourself. Hell, I have been blocked- and instead of getting upset- I started getting really busy with my own life and learning how 

What are some signs that your narcissistic ex misses you?
Once we have been discarded by the narcissist, and if like me it’s your first encounter with a narc, then we hope that they will miss us and want us back. Maybe even apoligise and say it’s going to be better once we’re together again . But the reality is, that narcissist NEVER change. No matter what they say/ act like or do in front of us they will always be the same. As for missing us, well, quite honestly they don’t. Now that might sound a bit harsh when we think about the love bombing stages and how kind/ loving they appeared to us, but they were just acting a part to get us on board and fall 

There will be no signs, because the narc does not miss you. Once the narc is gone he or she is busy lovebombing the new supply, and won’t think of you at all. The only time they might think of uou is when they get bored with the new supply, or if they are between supplies. Then they trawl round their exes, to see which ones are still pining for them, so they can get some sex or attention. The confusing and dangerous thing at this point ( for the ex, never the narc) is that the narc will tell you how much they love you and miss you- they never stopped thinking about you, what a huge mistake tha 

You may be contacted with what appears to be a benign action, a missed call, a text or email. A mutual acquaintance may contact you to tell you, “ so and so” was asking about you. Please keep in mind that they don't miss you, “the love”, the emotional attachment as you want to believe, hopefully you don't believe this anymore. They miss the situation, the temporary situation that existed with you. You've missed them but you can be confused by what you're feeling and project the normalcy you feel with what they are feeling. I tricked myself endlessly into thinking I was missed, she knows she's made 

I'm going to be honest and mindful of your feelings but the reality is they don't miss you. They miss what you were doing or was and what was offered as a result of being with you. Not you as a person. What you did. So don't expect them to care miss you or love you. Even if they are saying it. They miss the emotional interaction. It's about them. What benefits and is beneficial for them. They won't see your worth your qualities your character or virtues. Just what you can do for them. So don't wait on them or for them. Continue to live without them. The premonition the lies or the realization  

They don't miss you. That's half the issue you have letting go of this person from your life. You are waiting to see any form of empathy you yourself already know you won't see. Despite the great memories you had with them the reality is that the relationship was a transactional relationship. What this means is that the narcissist only chose to have this interacting with you because they got something out of it like money, gifts, sex and the list goes on.. When they then move on to the next supply they are focused on them and not you. They won't think of you. The values you believe are special to yo 

How likely is it that your narcissistic ex will miss you? It's as probable that they will miss you as anything on the following list is for them to do: They volunteer to go to MarsThey are possessed by the spirit of Mother TeresaThey join the Peace Corp and spend the rest of their lives digging ditches in UgandaThey donate one if their lungs to a stranger with COPDThey give all their money and house to help the homelessThey give up ALL their vices, incuding smoking, vaping, drinkng, drugging, porn, deviant sex and gamblingThey adopt every pet at the animal shelterThey take full responsibility f

they’ll never miss you, they only miss what they could use you for, and it could’ve been the way you made them feel, your attention, admiration, doesn’t always have to be sex or money or something super evil. They missed your “supply” but they can get it anywhere so don’t be flattered if they come back and say they missed you, you’re just the easiest way to get “supply” at that current moment. they just missed the attention you gave them. if they reach out you were the most convenient at that time, they’re lazy and want the most supply for the least amount of effort. If you were craving a bott 

There aren’t any. A true narcissist isn’t capable of that emotion like a regular person is. She might be missing what you did for her, but she doesn’t miss you. She will find someone else who can do for her what you did for her and then when that person stops fulfilling that need he/she will be discarded. It’s a very destructive pattern. I hope you are not asking this question because you want her to want you back. Be glad that you are no longer in a relationship with a narcissist so you can start to heal and begin to love yourself. Only then will you be able to enter a normal, healthy relations 

There are no signs, because there is no missing you. There is missing the feeling of control over you. There is missing you stroking their ego. There is missing your intense sympathy when they play the victim. There is missing the games they play with your head until you are weak and broken. If they come back for you, it is only for these reasons. They miss what you do for them; they do not miss you. 51.1K views · View upvotes · View shares583824Arn Prince, 6 years with my NPD partner, learning to let go.Updated 7 months ago · Author has 1.2K answers and 854.9K answer views

You know what? You should be about as concerned with those signs as you would be with the road signs on the opposite side of the highway on which you are traveling. You have to look in the rear view mirror to see both, and that only puts you in danger of never reaching your forward destination.

What caused you to fall out of love with your past lover?
I’m probably going to get a lot of heat for what I’m about to say, but here it is anyway. In today’s world. We get so consumed by our socio-economic statuses and gender inequality that we forget about the reality of biology and how human bodies actually work. Regardless of what people will say, men and women are not equal from a biological standpoint. This doesn’t mean that any one of the genders is better than the other, that’s just simply not true. We are just different. The way our bodies react to circumstances is different in its core. I agree that from a socio-economic standpoint, everyone 

When I first got married, we would be passionate everywhere, if you know what I mean, bed, floor, couch, where ever. We would do things for each other. And we enjoyed each other’s company. She was from Japan I am white american. I learned to speak Japanese and we lived in Japan a few years and life was good. We had kids together, but over the years things grew cold between us. They say that people change and you grow apart. I don’t think either of us changed. I doubt that most people change. What I suspected happened was that I would base my love on how much she loved me and visa versa. If she d 

Nothing, but at the same time, everything. I was with my ex for nine years, and for the last two of those years we were engaged. Engaged to be married? Nope. Engaged in a constant battle with each other. The seven years that led up to that point were amazing. I was bent out of shape from my previous relationship and he was there to heal me. He knew my worries, struggles and stresses but still thought the world of me. He made me feel beautiful when the whole world rejected me. (I'm not very attractive, never have been.) I lost my virginity to him, and even if he didn't lose his to me, he exclaime 

This is a story I never thought I would tell. The man I was set to marry before my current marriage turned out to be a maniac. We were together for four years and I loved almost every minute of it. He took me on expensive dates, we went on expensive holidays, and his family absolutely adored me. My mother adored him but my dad was always a bit suspicious of him and his intentions and told me to watch my back. My dad has always trusted his gut and it has never failed him, so this initially worried me. We started dating when I was around 21 and he proposed to me on my 23rd birthday. I reluctantly s 

I loved my ex-husband more than words can express. He was a passionate and intelligent, handsome and charming. He treated me well. Even our disagreements were mild. Two weeks before our wedding, he became angry with me. I don’t remember why. I don’t think it was over anything that was important or I’d remember. Anyway, he said horrific things about me while he was angry and broke my heart completely. I told my friends and family that I was calling off the wedding because I couldn’t marry a man who could be so cruel toward me. I was more hurt than I had ever been by anyone before. The things he  

I was married before to my daughter’s biological father. Things started out ok, but as the years passed, I learned that it wasn’t necessarily ME that he loved; it was more of a case that anyone could be me and married to him, and this became quite clear to me. That was what most of our fights were about towards the end. Gradually, with each passing day, more and more evidence came to light that he got this “job position” filled by whomever was willing to have sex with him at the time. I was a bit naïve and did not want to believe this about him. It got to a point where he had gone on a little  

I met my ex in the 9th grade, we became really close friends. Towards the end, I started falling for him and he hinted he liked me too. In the 10th grade, I asked him out and we dated for about a year. He was my best friend, and the one guy I truly loved. During junior year, I had to move to a different country, distance at first was not an issue but being a junior in high school balancing both work and a relationship was hard. He was really depressed that I moved in the beginning, months later, he started hanging out with guys who'd skip classes and smoke. And note, he was the type of guy who w 

The only person I truly 'fell out of love with' was my third girlfriend. I started dating her a few months after being devastatingly dumped by who I thought was 'the one' at that time in my life. She wasn't particularly attractive, or motivated, and she was a good candidate for a rebound relationship while I pinned for my ex. I know that sounds horrible, but I didn't realize I was doing that to her at the time (I realized it right before I split with her). She was funny and we enjoyed a lot of the same things…namley video games, drinking, and smoking weed. I was 22 at the time, she was twenty.  

He was my best friend. He was my first best friend. I never had a best friend in my life till then. I prefered staying alone , reading books , studying for exams , winning competition. I always got 1st rank in class . Head Girl of school . Basically a nerd . He was everything I wanted in friend . I eventually started falling in love with him . And then there was my friend ( girl ) .They two were the only friends in my life then. I never really wanted to tell him that I loved him because I was too scared and of course I did not want to ruin our friendship. Eventually my friend started pressuring  

I guess love is not always being together or getting married, sometime it means happiness of the other person even if you are not there to share with them. Let’s start a story….. Long back a cute love story emerge from a little crush of a girl on a boy. After a long and tiresome waiting when they were in a relationship the boy made some promises in disguise that he will offer everything that she lack in past several years, like fatherly love, freedom to enjoy the world, support to fulfill her dreams and lead a happy prosperous life. As time passes, as she enjoy her freedom some part of her tries 

When did you find out your spouse loves you even more than you thought?
I have been married for 7 years. It has been a beautiful journey with lots of love and silly fights. My husband doesn’t show his love through words but his actions. There are many incidents where I feel he loves me more than I realize. Few days after our marriage, we were roaming in the busy roads, enjoying street food. Suddenly I felt a lot of pain in my toes because of the newly worn toe ring. It was pretty tight and I was not able to walk. I told my husband, instantly he kneeled down before me in the busy roads with insane crowd, took my feet in his hands and gently pulled off my toe ring! I 

I had gotten out of a bad relationship when I was 23 due to him cheating and had trust issues. I had been with him for 7 years and I felt betrayed. I went three years being single after that. When I was 26 I went to a friend’s wedding. I was the only one among my friends who was single. I felt depressed and went outside to smoke, just thinking I’d be alone with my cats for the rest of my life when I hear a voice: “Are you ok?” I looked up into the face of Conor. I knew him back in school but we weren’t friends. He had special needs but wasn’t confident enough to make friends, thinking he was us 

Well, I knew he cared about having me in his life and he loved me deeply.. Firstly, I knew where his loyalties lie when he stood up to my family, and fought for my safety. He believed that I had every right to choose whom I should marry and not be coerced or blackmailed to follow what they believe to be true. Second, I knew he loved me when we were in the process of applying for the green card, this was after we were married (so that I could keep staying in the US, with him). When you begin the process of application, you are not allowed to leave the country. After they have made the decision, t 

We were married for almost 15 years before we had children, When Dan our youngest was two, he suffered from severe regressive autism. He went from speaking (albeit less than the normal) and smiling, from holding your face in his hands and planting a kiss- to rocking on his bed and banging his head, not just speechless but soundless- unable to even babble; from affectionate to attacking his older brother, and really only able to gain any solace at night, but this required someone co-sleeping with him and squeezing him so that he could calm down. We had to sue the school system- they stated that  

Not my spouse but my girlfriend. We are together since more than five years now. One year ago I decided that I wanted to leave from my home country (France) to live and study one year in Australia. Definitely not the closest country that I could have pick up. But even knowing that she supported and encouraged me while I told her that I wanted to leave alone (the most selfish decision of my life). Indeed, I thought that I was at a key point of my life where I had to take a radical decision to achieve my life aims and figure out who I am by going through this kind a big life challenge. The fact th 

Mike taught me real selfless love time and time again. When my parents learned about him they took my phone and almost all means of communication, treated me like garbage and threatened me with many things. They came to me and said “you're an idiot if you think he'll still be with you after things got serious. He was just toying with you". I just had to rely on my faith in him. And one month later he was in Kuwait to see me and my family.When I was hospitalized for my mental breakdown he called everyone in my family and constantly asked about me.He paid thousands and thousands of dollars to com

Couple of months after we got married. One weekend afternoon, just before spring, my husband and I were unwinding ourselves on the couch, talking without any agenda. We were chit chatting, and every now and then, he would wipe his forehead and nose. I noticed sweat dropping from his forehead. I thought we both were cool and comfortable with the temperature we had set for our house, which was– ahem… 77–79F. Disclaimer- Pleasant weather for you may be borderline cold for me, and cold for you is my chillliiiiiing. Plus I have this thing, some symptoms of which a doctor once termed as ‘cold allergy’.  

The day he cried for me. So, the story goes like this. We had an arranged marriage. We barely knew each other and in 2 months we were married. Immediately after our wedding, I fell sick and had to be hospitalized for quite a few days. And by the time I recovered it was almost 2 months post our wedding. So, even after the wedding, we barely spent time with each other. Though, by this time I had fallen in love with him head over heels. Fast forward another 2 months, we were just about getting used to living with each other, adjusting to our new lives with each other, me getting used to my conservati 

When I lost the pregnancy. I got into a relationship with a great guy two years ago and I fell for him deeply. I had some doubts before taking this decision as he is younger than me, he wasn’t at a point of his life where he wanted to marry or have children. But after a couple of months, he started to open himself to the idea of starting a family. Our relationship was flourishing and we thought it would be an amazing journey to raise a child together. I thought I was the luckiest girl in the world. We started trying for a baby and going to an infertility clinic as I have serious fertility issues 

Well!! The man is still not my husband but I am sure he will going to be the Best Husband. About a month ago we got engaged after 1 year of courtship. I was in a relationship before and he was aware of it. He said he is alright with the fact that I had a past, and he is not at all like a man who will think and over react on this. I however doubted it. Few days back we were just shopping, he went to get something to eat and I was roaming around,when suddenly I heard a familiar voice calling me by my name. I turned around and it took me few seconds to recognize the person who was standing at a dist 

Why do people always say that you find love when you're not looking for it?
If you know the root of attraction then you’ll know the root of love, and you’ll never even focus on women or men, but that what has always worked. Have you noticed, the ones who do find love, go through a journey of focusing on creating their assets, resources, and having things like a lifestyle most women and men want to be part of? Like, they study, then get a degree, or start a business, and then after years, they are living a life such as flying abroad, living in the sun, got an ok lifestyle that most don’t have and suddenly they share the story with.. “And then this woman/man travelled hund 

I was prepared to be single for the rest of my life. I came to that conclusion in college. Every guy I dated wanted to graduate, have their girlfriend (me) follow them to some suburbia for their job, get married, and start a family. I wanted to travel, live abroad, gain new experiences, and I didn’t want to start a family for a long time, maybe ever. I never found a guy with the same goals as me. In fact, they always treated me as if it was never going to happen. I was unwilling to compromise the future I felt I was destined to have. I felt that if I gave up the future I wanted for a husband,  

I think because it is largely true. You asked, Why do people always say that you find love when you’re not looking for it? There are a number of possible reasons. One, in particular, is the notion that you spend so much time and energy looking for love that you miss the opportunity to experience it. Imagine that you are supposed to meet someone at the airport and you don’t know what they look like. You know their name and the general time they will arrive, but how can you find them. So you write their name on a piece of paper, hoping they will find you. Frantically you are looking for them and ho 

They don’t. That’s a romantic notion perpetuated through the loud minority and wishful thinking. Plus it makes good viewing and easy storytelling. It’s a great example of selection bias. Far more frequently people don’t find ‘true love’ even when they ‘look for it’, it ends horribly and many if not most of us end up old and lonely. It’s not a real phrase, ‘true love’. The people who happen to be extremely compatible are no more or less in love than anyone else.. they’re just more compatible and have enough tools and maturity to work through any issues. Of course if their compatibility is high enou 

People say this because it’s at least partly true, and also because (like most pithy, slightly paradoxical statements) makes them feel/sound insightful when they say it. The problem of course is that it can be taken out of its appropriate context and lead people to the wrong idea as well. When is it true? When “looking for love” means obsession with being in a relationship or desperation to preserve or create a relationship at any cost, it can have a repelling effect on people who know what a healthy relationship looks like. A person who is stuck in this kind of approach to relationships is so  

Well, I can answer this because that's what happened to me. I was never comfortable with the idea that I would have to quest around to find “the one” for me. I never liked the implication that I was somehow incomplete without a romantic partner and that I needed to search for someone to fix the lack. It's not that I'm not romantic or capable of attraction; it's that I would rather spend my time doing things that would fulfil me and make me proud of my own progress. If I happened to meet someone and we happened to work out, yay! But I never wanted to make THAT my life's goal, because it relies s 

Anonymous because I don’t want my parents or her to read this. Warning: This is a bit long and personal, so if you don’t care about the details, skip to the end. Because it’s true. For years I told myself that actually falling in love would never happen. I’m a social outcast, I thought it to be impossible. I thought that maybe I’d be able to snag a date or two for a while, but that never happened anyway. I wasn’t interested in anyone who was interested in me and vice versa. I had been around her for most of my time in high school. We have 3 classes together. But, it stayed to mostly friendly inter 

Love finds you doesn't make sense at all. Everyone here wants to be loved. Looking for love means you look for right person. right? And the right person, they're not going to just appear from no where. Yes, you have to make efforts to gain something. But love is a strange thing. No matter what , you can't completely define love. So, how can someone decides that it's love. May be it was just attractions. Or may be the other person have some quality that you likes and you want that in yourself. So, you become attractive towards them. Or some people care about you because you are kind, geniune pe 

Because, while online dating and “swipe” apps may allow you to fulfill a temporary, sexual need, you are less than likely going to find someone who has similar like interests or common goals that you have for your own life. Let me explain: I once said - “a woman wants a man in pursuit of a goal… not a man in pursuit of a woman.” Why? Because humans have a purpose. Each individual has something spectacular to do with their life that can contribute to a better world. Just like the air we breathe, the dust that lands about, the pollen on a bee's belly, or the bee itself, we have a purpose to fulfill 

The main reason applicable to young people is what I will call “the track.” Social narratives about proper relationships, and the judgments that we all form and all fear based on these narratives, will strangle romance, so much so that romance can only develop while the brain is being distracted by something else. It may not be a coincidence that many a rom-com romance begins with bumping into someone on the street. Who bumps into someone else on the street? Someone who is not only not looking for love, they are so distracted they literally can’t see two feet in front of their face. Let me expla 

When was the first time you realised that your cat really loved you?
What makes a man fall in love with a woman?
Man falls in love with a woman because.. His number desire the need and want for approval and validation. This can mean many ways of showing that; and I can mention some. That she shows him affection, she behaves in a feminine way in recipocrating his flirtatious ways and she shows vulnerability to him. She makes him feel special, needed, wanted in her life. When she sees him or hears from him she is excited, it feels like she has been waiting to hear from him. He is wanted. He is needed. He is loved. How so many women especially young women fail in this first one is crazy. You’d not believe 

From the answers here I say most men have certain (sometimes bizzare!) fantasies, but actually have no idea - or are unwilling to tell - what actually makes them ‘fall in love’ with a women. My answer is not pretty. I am going to tell the truth about men regards women they ‘fall in love’ with and marry.  Basically, a man falls in love with the woman who can best fulfill his EGO. But every man has different ego needs. One man may prize women who are high maintenance, as this fulfills their ego need of being the partner of someone who is high status (which can lend him the status which he lack on hi 

Well, in some cases, utter and complete stupidity and naiveté. In other cases? Physical appearance. In yet others, personality, actions, and the whole kit n kaboodle. There are millions of differing reasons, but ultimately, there are some basic things that do tend to do it. Here's a few of the more usual suspects: Old fashioned gender roles: The woman makes the man feel like a man, virile, like a good provider, and an overall good person. It can feel like a natural high, and who wouldn't want a feeling like that as often as possible, eh? Excuse me for a minute. My wife needs me to open a jar of

Women are sensitive. Some it is really difficult to assure of a lady is truly in love with you or not. Girls are so coquettish so not every man can manage to recognize their mood at first view. Anything that arouses Interest in a person also attracts her. If a girl holds her kook on to you for long, then you can defiantly talk about her interest. Although it's too early to tell about falling in love. Love can make a girl do tyle o clothes, change interests. You must appreciate such a girl who can change her lifestyle just to impress you. A woman in love will be looking for an opportunity with

Why Man Fall in Love with a women? That seems to be the elusive million dollar question. But … it’s not so elusive. Women can’t always see it clearly because women typically have a goal from the start, the goal being to get a commitment and have that rare, once in a lifetime, loving relationship. But what causes men to fall in love with a woman? What makes one woman special and unique? He feels seen and appreciated for who he is. Men are absolutely starved for appreciation. You may not realize it because he probably doesn’t come right out and ask for it, but you’ll see the effect it has on him whe 

Well, I will answer this question from a woman’s perspective. I mean to say what a woman thinks can make a man fall for her. Certainly, men-women falling for each other is a natural instinct. But, when it comes to the point of what makes a man fall in love with a woman, the touchstones are as follows: How she looks and makes herself presentable in different occasions at different times of the day in different outfitsHer intelligence that glows in her eyes and makes her different from the rest of the worldHow she at the same time be tender and rough, whatsoever and whenever requiredHer emotional

Recently a famous Hollywood actor married a pornstar. She still has her profile on the Hookup Site. When asked what made him fell in love in an interview, here are his reason below.  Honesty: Someone that is brutally honest. Not someone that just tells you what you want to hear. Even if it jeopardizes the relationship itself, honesty goes a long way. Trust: There can’t be love with no trust. Trust is earned and not given away. And from my experience, it’s hard to find. Loyalty: Someone that goes through your life in good and bad. Has your back in the bad times, not just the good. They support you

When was the first time you realised that your cat really loved you?
Just after college, I responded to an ad from an overloaded animal shelter in NYC. They were looking for volunteers to house cats temporarily while they searched for permanent homes. I was given a mother with her eight week old kittens. I had no prior experience with cats much less kittens, but was elated to have them. They five would climb up my boyfriend’s jeans and sit on his shoulders. Sometimes one would make it all the way to his head. I had no idea they had so much personality! We were to look after them for a month while they were weaned. Gradually it occurred to us that one kitten woul 

My parents were violent people. My mom would use our bodies as an outlet for stress whenever my dad was not around. She would time these “punishments” when my dad would be away for days so he would not see the wounds, bruises, and bite marks. On an almost daily basis, she would get away with hitting and kicking us in areas of our bodies hidden by clothing. I had a cat then, and she was a real bitch. I attributed this mean behavior of hers to her past, as a stray cat who was used to being neglected and abused on the streets of a local wet market, where i picked her up. Seeing myself in her, I to 

My brother was studying in Copenhagen. In November 2018, his laptop exploded and burned everything in his room, except his expensive phone that he had bought with his own money and things in the cupboard. He was already depressed and it was going to be Christmas vacation at his uni so we decided to bring him home to India after his exams were done. In less than a month, someone at a train station stole his phone. He had NOTHING left with him. I booked his flight immediately and asked him to make EC as his passport was burnt too.

My first cat, Tiger, my sweet sweet boy, used to cuddle up to me when I was crying. I would be sobbing quite softly in my room, with my door closed, at the age of 13 or 14, and he would pidder padder from wherever he was and start meowing at my door. I used to find it so annoying because I’d prefer to be alone and he had a habit of coming into rooms after I had gotten up to let him in, and then trying to leave as soon as I sat down. But then, I realised, If I kept the door open a crack for him to paw open, he felt much more at ease. I guess confined spaces scared him. He would come right next to m 

My cat’s name is Marmalade, and she’s an Indie street breed whose mother was brought up as a house cat. She was brought to me on my birthday when she was bareky 2.5 months old because her new young mom was beginning to abandon her kittens.

We got Bootsie from a local shelter. He is a beautiful male Snowshoe and was about 2 1/2 years old when we got him. He had been used for breeding, and was then sold to a family who had a very dominant male cat, and a husband who didn’t like this little Snowshoe. They kept him for about 3 months and then turned him over to the shelter. Bootsie spent 6–8 weeks at the shelter before we adopted him. When we adopted Bootsie he had been neutered and we were told he was up to date on all of his vaccinations. We weren’t told that he had no social skills. That being said, the first few months Bootsie was 

I didn’t usually have to wait long. I have rescued cats for years, so I’ll just mention 3. I went to a shelter to get a companion for my little dog, who was used to being surrounded by animals and people all day. I was moving out of my parents’ house and into my own apartment, and as a full time teacher, I would be gone for long periods of time. I didn’t want to get another dog, so I had decided on a cat. I went not planning to get a male (I had grown up with female cats), a black cat (I had light furniture), or a long haired cat (too much grooming involved for a first year special ed teacher t 

Sushi was his name. I'd known for a long time that he loved me. He came to me as a tortured kitten. Often scared of his own shadow, he bonded to me immediately. I just never realized how much he loved me, until I got sick.  ( I was pretty sick, like lucky to be alive sick. I even had weird visions of him in the hospital, but that's a story for another time.) When I got home he clung right back to me, and life became a new normal for us. He learned to be careful around me. (I sat on him once because I didn't see him, which was a scary weekend for sure), but he adapted, and so did I.  It 

Meet my kitten Brownie:  This is the story of how i discovered she really loves me. When I graduated from highschool, I was offered a great opportunity to study in one of my country's best universities, thank God. Problem is, the university is 2 hours away from home, so I needed to rent a dormitory. I did, and I share it with a classmate of mine. Even though I come back home every weekend to see my family , it is really difficult to leave every Sunday night and spend a week away. I am very attached to my cats, and the hardest thing to do is saying goodbye to them every Sunday. However, the first tim 

In 1983 the economy was booming in Anchorage faster than construction could keep up with it. There was a zero vacancy rate in town. People with good jobs were living in their cars because there were no places available. Naturally, our landlord jacked up our rent so my wife and I had to move out. All we could find was a cockroach infested apartment that became vacant because the previous inhabitant was arrested for contract murder. No pets were allowed. I assume the mice and cockroaches had grandfather rights. My wife decided we needed a cat. I’m a cat person, but as hard as it had been to get t 

How do married people stay in love with their spouse when they are old, wrinkled, and grey?
I’m not quite wrinkled yet but I’m definitely past mid-life so the grey hairs have well and truly taken over. My husband and I have now reached the point where we’ve been together longer than we’ve lived apart. We met in Santorini, Greece, a few decades ago, when neither of us were necessarily looking to fall in love. He was on his way to Gallipoli to visit his great grand-father’s grave, while I had just finished university in France and wanted to spend the rest of my summer in Greece. He was the first person I remember meeting on my second day on the island. I suppose everybody was new and i 

Hmmm… let me try to answer this. When I first met my wife I thought she was crazy beautiful. I was not, however, in love with her. I didn’t know her but saw her from afar. To me she was like beautiful art. Truly gorgeous. Then I got to know her. We became best friends first. No sexual relationship. Just friends. I then learned that she was truly beautiful inside also. This is why I began to fall in love with her. It was not because of her looks, it was because of the person she is. So now we have been married for 27 years. Perhaps she is not as physically beautiful as she was back then. She is, h

I can only speak for myself and not for old, married couples. I’m still young and unmarried, but here’s my input anyway. I do not plan to marry any woman for her physical appearance. I want a woman with a certain type of personality and mindset. Physical appearances change over time, but good personalities can remain the same or even improve as spouses grow older. I will always associate my future wife’s physical appearance with her positive qualities which I’ll greatly treasure for life. When she’s old, wrinkled and grey, we will have spent so much time together and experienced so many positiv 

When I met my now wife, she was a young 26year old with long blond hair, she was the most beautiful person I had ever seen and way out of my league. Anyway I started to chat to her online, it was wonderful even though I was 16 years her senior she made me feel at ease with all we talked about, I had just come out of a loveless relationship and honestly thought I would be alone for the rest of my life. As time passed I grew close to her Sam, and looked forward to getting home from work every day so I could log on and chat to her, I would tell her about my day and she would tell me about hers, I  

You begin by choosing your partner wisely. You don't settle. You must ask yourself: Is this person the love of your life? Is this person someone you find difficult to be apart from? Is this someone who compliments you and your lifestyle? I've heard people say about the companion they're with, “She's (or he's) a good person.” Yes, that's all well and good, but it's not enough. Do they light a fire of passion within you? Do you find it hard to keep your hands off them? Next month, my wife and I will celebrate 47 years of marriage, although we've been together a lot longer having met when we were 

Being in love isn't the same thing as being in lust. All people get old and grey if they are lucky, there is no avoiding that. There is also no human right that states that we all deserve to be with someone that stays hot for their entire life. Doesn't it sound silly to expect that when you think of it that way? Everyone would be single, that's not even feasible. When you love someone, you like their personality and being with them. That doesn't necessarily go away. If you were attracted to them in the beginning, that attraction is strengthened by love. An old grey husband still looks like his y

Ok, well…because it's too darn annoying to get up and move and start all over when you're old, wrinkled, and grey. That's why! Your joints ache, your back gives out on an almost daily basis, and gods forbid you should trip over something. You'll fall and break your dang hip. That hurts!

What is love?  Like, love, or ‘in love’? Psychological research over the past 50 years has investigated the differences between liking someone, loving someone, and being “in love”. Liking is described as having positive thoughts and feelings towards someone and finding that person’s company rewarding. we frequently also experience warmth and closeness towards the people we like. In some instances, we elect to be emotionally intimate with these people.  When we love someone we experience equivalent positive thoughts and experiences as once we sort of a person.

  Meet this man- Arunachalam Muruganantham, the man who wore a sanitary pad to break a taboo. He defined love not by his words(which anyone can do) but by his actions(which very few can do). He showed what true love really means and he did that by showing his love towards his wife by providing the permanent solution for her wife's problem. One fine day, Arunachalam Muruganantham asked his wife about a dirty rag she was sneaking with. Realizing that she was managing her 'menstrual problem', he was shocked to know that using a sanitary pad would affect the family's budget for milk. Adamant to impre

Love is when your mother doesn’t care what shape, size, form, gender, type you are born with and keeps you close to your heart in every situation. Love is when you don’t care the breed, gender, type of the puppy you see and go Awwww and start to pamper it!

That reminds me when our life, as infants, are very dependent on parental help. Love therefore has been a mechanism to promote the same parental support of children. According to neurochemistry, neurotransmitters and neuropeptides are what love is. Testosterone, estrogen, dopamine, oxytocin, and vasopressin drive the feeling of what we call 'love'. Central dopamine pathways effect the partner's behavioor. Vasopressin in the ventral pallidum and

I was friends with my boyfriend for a year before we got together. We talked every day. We went out together. We laughed together. I loved him - as a friend. Four days after we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend, exactly one month ago, I had a date night planned with him, but his roommate got sick, and we had to cancel. I was in the middle of moving into my flat, and had no furniture, food, or stuff to do. He stopped by at lunch time with pizza, flowers, strawberries, and ice cream.

I finally told my ex to hit the road when our 3 year anniversary had rolled around and I was drunk 3 hours away from his university. It was a difficult breakup. He stalked me for months after. Sending me pictures of his self mutilation, walking all over his city at  

I missed her. We were friends for years, having met in church. I always got the feeling that she liked me, but she drove me crazy. We kind of drove each other crazy, actually. We were asked to lead church events together, because we were good at it, but that often led to fights because she had trouble seeing how often I had the correct perspective on things… :-) She was about as different from me as anyone could be, so if there were two ways to do something, guaranteed we each chose a different way. We had lots of fun dates over the years with our other friends, just casual stuff. Game nights, di 

Can you really find love again after you broke up with someone who you thought was “the one”?
Why after ten months of no contact do I still think about her? I have done a good job of moving on but sometimes memories pop up out of nowhere and the hurt returns. I still love this person, and I don’t for the life of me know why.
What are some psychological facts about love?
Giving a woman independence is a love paradox. The more independence you give her, the more she feels drawn to you.Surprising a woman with intimate gifts like a negligee, new panties or a bra triggers the same feelings of love like just before the first sexual encounter.You can easily know if a woman loves you by looking at her body language when another woman is looking at you while smiling.You can easily rekindle a dead relationship by frequently spending time together at a camping site, a trip, adventure, or going to a picnic.Women experience psychological pleasure first before they experie

I don’t like using the words “hack” and “love” in the same sentence, however, there are some points which I can propose from my personal experience and practice: Never make major decisions about the relationship in the state of anger. We all get a little flustered sometimes with our better halves, and it’s easy to say/do something you don’t actually mean in the heat of an argument. My “hack” for this is – just remember that the person who you are arguing with IS the love of your life (hopefully), and is it really worth arguing about something which, most likely, isn’t worth arguing in the first

What simple gesture screams "I love you"?
What simple gesture screams "I love you"? This answer is for the ladies, gentlemen, boys and girls, men and women and every other pronoun in existence. If you are thinking of dating a human, tune in too my aliens and whatever else! People tend to think of grand gestures to proclaim their love. Or expensive ones. Diamonds, gold, cars and vacations; none of this is the language of love. Do you want to know the horrible truth? The world is always reaching for your wallet. Those aren't dollars and cents you're spending, those are hours and minutes of your life you will never see again. And those don 

Get ready for some good ones:  "It's not silly, tell me more"Random hugs from behind"No no, you can't walk there alone. Let me come with you.""You look tired, it's ok, I can do (insert chore here.) You rest up.""I made sure that I saved this spot for you, I know you like to sit here.""Text me when you get back home."Not being hurtful/mean/disrespectful even during a fight. Something like: ‘’Yes, we are having a disagreement right now but I still love you, respect you as an individual and treat you as my partner not a punching bag’’They tell you how they really feel. Not like outright "I love you

This one's for you handsome! Whenever I kind of go crazy nuts and just blast at you out of no where, pouring out my emotions, I know you want to say so many things too, maybe not so nice things, but you don't, because you don't want to hurt me. You keep all that inside.I notice this gesture of yours Mr. Handsome which screams “I love you". Even when you're mad at me, you look out for me. You care for my well being and safety. You never say no. You can move mountains for me whenever necessary and I know that.I notice this gesture of yours Mr. Handsome which screams “I love you". Out in this world 

 1.If having that person besides you makes you feel safe. 2.The adorable smile ,blush and glittering of eyes when someone mention your name before. 3.The daily good morning massage you get right after you wake up and the daily goodnight massage before you shut your eyes. 3.That apology and continuously massages and call to keep the relationship intact . 4.That fear on eyes of loosing you. 5.Those efforts to make you happy during those difficult days.Taking extra care and gathering of knowledge of what makes you happy and comfortable . 5.Those innocent and incessant tears without a word for you when y 

Following things according to me may not scream but at least for me is equivalent to “I Love You”. My day starts at 6 in the morning and i wake my husband at around 7am.The small peck on my cheek / hug inviting me to come sleep when i wake my husband.Always being by my side whenever i need but also encouraging me to try out new things in life.“Did you Reach?”- is a message i receive daily at around 10:00 AM from my husband is very much “I love you to me “.“Lets eat out”-Seeing me tired/in no mood to cook.Forcing me to complete my own New Year Resolution of Walking Everyday is another way of say

When, as a toddler, you have a highly communicable disease, and your mother is by your side every minute, treating your symptoms as best she can without fear of contracting the affliction herself. That screams love. When, as a child, you see that the neighbors Japanese pond is full of scum and algae. As a five year old, you see the algae forming on the fish’s eyes, and think they’re going to die, so you take laundry soap and pour it in the pond to clean the fish, but they all die. The neighbor lady comes after you, thinking you’re nothing but a little brat. Your mother storms out there and gets

Again, why does this have to be about just Men and Women? Let me have an alternate take. For Your Country : Keeping it clean, taking precautions for the health of yourself and your countrymen. Not damaging public property.

I made it in the break while you were still in the meetings. 4. Did you reach office? 5. Let me walk on the side right beside the road. 6. Staying quiet when the other person is all angry and hyped up to avoid further conflicts. Putting across the points when the situation is calmed down. 7. Here's the shirt that you gifted me. It is lucky for me and wears it to the interview. 8. Grab your lunch. It's really late already. 9. I'm aware that you're chumming 

What simple gestures scream of love…after the sparkle of youth has dulled; after the children have left and married? After bodies have aged and slowed; after you’ve realized, you’re old? There are many simple ways.  Photo Credit: Candida.Performa A gesture of love is heard in a pleasant, “Good morning;” seen in a glance; felt from a smile. Love’s gesture is cheerfully giving a shoulder rub, despite the throb of hurting hands. It is foregoing one, upon sensing the other’s pain. It is enduring clumsy hearing aids, so the other need not shout. It is nuzzling close for words’ and bodies’ caress. Love’s g 

What is the most terrible way you’ve seen a person that you loved transform into someone unrecognizable?
How can you objectively determine who is a coward and who isn't?
From my life experience and take on (somewhat limited) studies in psychology and criminology, I will try to break this down for you. To be a coward, in a traditional sense, someone needs to feel fear. Fear is a necessary survival instinct, that can be rational and irrational. When someone succumbs to excessive fear and cannot take necessary actions, then he is a «coward». But what is wroing in being a coward? Why not? What do I care? Cowardice is frown upon, because it transfers risk from one actor to another, or hinders solidaric sharing of risk, which results in mission failure or excessive cas 

You can’t see it on someone’s face, that’s for sure. Look at this picture here. These are some of my comrades in the early stages of the Kosovo War. One of the guys in this picture was a big coward while all the others were excellent fighters. One day, this person simply was gone. A deserter. Can you tell who is the coward?  Of course not. The question must also be permitted whether this guy really was such a big coward. Didn’t he volunteer to fight in a very dangerous conflict? Determining who is a ‘coward’ is a slippery slope. Therefore, the term ‘coward’ should better be avoided. Even the way  

Well, you cannot objectively and easily spot every single coward, but some cowards usually can be spotted very easily, in a very short conversations on certain subjects, such as military service, rescuing people or doing other dangerous jobs. In my book, what characterizes a real coward, is the coward’s willingness to risk with other’s people lives, health, welfare, reputation, just to spare herself or himself from difficulties and risks. Cowardice is not about fear, because all people fear, and it is about not being able to deal with your selfishness and entitlement and putting your problems a 

You cannot. There is no way telling on who is a coward and who is courageous. Cowardice is not overwhelming fear or lack of moral fibre or inability to control one’s nerves; it is simply disregard of one’s friends, comrades and the group you belong. You might say cowardice is the ultimate act of selfishness. Anyone, who is not a complete nincompoop or a psychopath, fears. I have a tendency to say now what kind of hobby is one where you cannot lose your life?, but the fact is that I do fear. Every time I climb the jump plane or the diving boat or head to open sea, I fear. The secret is to act eve 

When you live long enough, you see evidence of certain behavior and form conclusions based on that. So that if a person acts in a manner customarily believed to be cowardly, and their behavior is also cowardly, you can pretty much tell by the things people say and do who is cowardly and who is not. For instance, a man who molests children and focuses all of his cruel deeds on children would be cowardly. Because he does so, knowing the children cannot fight back. The same could be said for men that overpower and beat up women. And again, men who choose to pick on people they perceive as having le 

No, you cannot. Some people consider me a coward, because I do everything I can to avoid violence. However, violence is part of what was my professional vocation. Be it with assault rifles, knifes, blunt weapons or my hands, I will either do what I can to not send you to a hospital, even if it causes you a great deal of pain, or I will kill you. A good way to describe it is, I take a long time to go from 0 to 60, but from 60 and upwards, you will not have time to react to the situation and consider your options. That is by design; almost every belligerent encounter will never reach 40, while a f 

You can't. When you say someone is smart or stupid or brave or cowardice, what we are really doing is marginalizing a person based on your definition. We are imposing that the person will continue to conform, and predicting that their next moves will corroborate our assertion. But this isn't how people behave, it isn't how we are, and reputation is mostly a social construct. So these assertions are never accurate nor are they objective. It's what someone thinks of someone, even if that someone is us thinking of ourselves.  There is nothing that can predict whether someone's next act will be smar 

Did you know that a coward can fight, and win the fight?  Sure.  Especially if fighting and winning would shut someone up who was right about them.  Coward - a person who lacks the courage to do or endure dangerous or unpleasant things. So if it was unpleasant to face a truth, it would be cowardly to use violence to silence the truth. That means that all your direct correlations between fighting and courage are incorrect.  Fighting doesn't make someone courageous.  The reasons why we fight.... or don't fight... are what make the difference between being a courageous and cowardly.  Your example ab 

You only can figure it out sometimes who knows he is a coward and who doesn’t know it yet. People are cowards in some circumstances and less in others. And the more brave they are in some circumstances the most likely it is that they will be a coward in other ones. The ones who know all that usually have more self-control and are less likely to behave in extreme cowardly ways. Anyway cowardly is a social convention. This is not a measurable attribute. [Edit] A clear as water example taken from other answers. Those who attribute their courage to their feeling of belonging to a community and their 

Cowardice and bravery is simply being in a situation that you can handle or a situation you can’t handle. Some people are great at fighting and soldering - so they may ‘look’ brave by beating people up and fighting wars but lots of these type of men throughout history have killed and raped women and murdered children - who are usually unarmed - nothing more cowardly than those actions - the Waffen SS fought bravely on the battlefield against the Soviets but murdered millions of unarmed innocent of people in the most cowardly of fashion. The reason there are nine billion of us is because we as a  

What do you genuinely just not understand?
Um… pardon my English I genuinely don’t understand religion, the bible and stuff like that. I’m going to talk about the religion I was born in you see, I was born to a Christian family, majority of people in my country are Christians not to mention Christianity is a subject that we learn in our schools. I hope you see it from my point of view I really don’t have a religion; I decided it’s not worth believing in an orthodox or anything that I have not stopped to observe keenly okay where do I even start… do you ever just stop for a moment and think “maybe the book of genesis- or the bible itself-is fl

There are some things about human nature that I cannot even begin to comprehend. Sometimes I feel I am not totally part of the human race because to me these things don't make sense. I can't find any logical reason but these things go on everyday and everyone else seems to find it normal, I never will. Hunting for sport. I don't mean someone who has no food, no money is starving and needs to eat. That's not the same thing. I mean the people who find pleasure in killing an animal, someone who puts an animal's head on their wall, totally disgusting and to me that is a form of mental illness and de 

A girl was talking and giggling with her friends while the teacher was talking to the class. Eventually the teacher gets mad and says to that girl “Mikayla, why are you talking?” Mikayla looks around the class with a theatrical expression of surprise. Then she looks at the teacher dead in the eyes and incredulously says “I wasn’t talking!” The teacher gets mad and says “Yes you were, Mikayla, I saw and heard you!” The class was chuckling and looking at the teacher as if she is dumb and overreacting. Mikayla lets out a fake groan and shakes her head, an amused smile on her face, as if the teacher is 

Vegans who also keep their pets on a vegan diet. When I first heard about some people ACTUALLY doing that, I almost couldn’t believe it. I thought that was the most ridiculous and hypocritical thing I could think of. Vegans usually describe and portray themselves as animal lovers, protectors. How do you protect animals if you’re forcing your pet onto an unnatural and sometimes even damaging diet?? Some animals need meat. Not like, NEED. You hurt and abuse your pet by not providing that. If you don’t want to provide your pet the meat it needs for whatever reason, then don’t have pets!!!! You talk a 

I don’t understand a few things: Blame others for our mistakes.Always like to criticize though we own a lot of flaws.Treating others like shit.When get caught choose to lie.Pretend to be an overly emotional person for sympathy.Exceeded expectation level from others though we know we’re zero in fulfilling other’s expectations.Zero contribution to society but expect society to be there when needed.Zero social life.Getting credits for zero/others work.Not valuing others but expecting people to value you.Claiming to be busy but not as it’s all about priority. If you can’t find time for your own peo

5 Things You Don't Know about Yourself You probably do not understand yourself as well as you think you do  1. Your perspective on yourself is distorted. Your “self” lies before you like an open book. Just peer inside and read: who you are, your likes and dislikes, your hopes and fears; they are all there, ready to be understood. This notion is popular but is probably completely false! Psychological research shows that we do not have privileged access to who we are. When we try to assess ourselves accurately, we are really poking around in a fog. Princeton University psychologist Emily Pronin, who  

I don’t understand SELFISHNESS. It is so much pRevalent in the USA and now in INDIA I experience the same. Everybody is all about themselves. Recently I attended a SOCIETY meeting in our building. The residents from a distance (I stood as far….as I could….my migraines were acting up) SEEMED LIKE DOGS BARKING….each talking about his or her issue that needs to be addressed. If this video was shown to their kids, they would all put aside their favorite show and watch this and have a good laugh. In the US Individualism is preached…..they are COLD and HEARTLESS….Only time I saw them unite was after  

I find it difficult to grasp how light can be polarized both in transverse planes and circumfrentially. Just what are the interactions with semitransparent surfaces at atomic dimensions? Too what are the characteristics of a vacuum that fix light or other electromagnetic radiation to a specific velocity. Why does a photon broaden as it travels from extreme distances? What are the characteristics of matter that determine degrees of opacity to electromagnetic radiation? Is there a thicknesses of lead for example below which light will pass through and if so why? Oh, and let's not forget women. Ju 

Physics. When I was choosing my O-levels I knew I was rubbish at science, so I wanted to take a CSE in general science, to give me some understanding in all three (this was quite a long time ago, so for those not familiar with these British exams: they O-levels and CSE’s were taken at age 16 normally, A-levels at 18. O-level was at a higher level than CSE). Apparently I was far too academic to have to lower myself to do a CSE, so as I could do maths, I was put on the physics course. During the lesson I would concentrate as hard as I could, and eventually understand what the teacher had said. Sor 

Why so many Brits hold such hatred in their hearts for the US that they can't bring themselves to say even one positive thing about it (which surely will cause at least one of them to respond with “because there is nothing positive to say”Why so many people use “literally” in a figurative sense, littering their sentences with the word while there are invariably HUNDREDS of words that would be better suitedWhy vegans can't just shut their traps and be vegan quietlyHow voter ID laws are racist yet its not racist to require ids to buy cigarettes, drive, buy alcohol, travel by plane, get a loan et

Why are so many decent people single nowadays?
Distractions. okay here’s the thing, we are obsessed with Hollywood movies and tv shows, whenever it comes to love and relashionships, people think it’s like real life but it’s not, definitely not we’ve seen a loty in the movies about and nerdy nice guy who gets bullied in school , and that bully is dating his high school crush, a beautiful girl. SHe wants to change him to become a good guy, however girls get influenced by these moving (without even realising it) and they start looking for that agressive guy who will treat her like trash , and they’ll keep the decent guy in the friendzone because 

The world has changed . How people are viewed has changed. You come across people who on the outside put up the mask of charm and flattery, who project themselves as the most suitable partners and very soon end up with someone. Problem is with the times - not willing to go too spiritual into answering this question , but just understand that the present YUGA is that of deception .People who are good at deceiving and flattering and flashing usually have their way .They entice the opposite sex easily . The instant attraction bridges the initial hesitation and very soon a new “made for each other”  

Having never lived in any other era I can’t assume that there are more decent single people now than there were. But suppose you are right and more great candidates for relationships are staying alone these days, why might that be? Some have talked about the difficulties of modern dating, and I think that is part of it. But another part is the absolute lack of necessity to partner up. As an educated woman with her own interests, the idea of hitching my life to another’s sounds risky at best. I can buy my own house and save for my own retirement, I have no financial need to find a husband like my 

I am going to fuck with your mind. I use strong language to make my point. If you are easily excited, I suggest you take cover now. Decent people? Is that some sort of a 21st century euphemism for conceited people? We are so complex and smart, are we not? We have evolved from our natural default settings and have learned to mind fuck ourselves. We’re so noble and squeaky clean. What has happened in the last 60 years in our societal evolution is that we have embraced pure selfishness and named it choice. What a load of shit.

The days of the “routine” of a young girl was to : Get her first job (usually a typing pool/copy typist.Find a boyfriend.Having found the Mr. Right, get married and have first baby.Having returned to work and later had baby II , the expected norm was to “retire” to look after “the children” (In the days when one income could afford run a family of 4 ! )Nowadays: Both men and women want a career these days hence the fall in the number of people who do get married either not starting a family at all, or just have the one baby.Life these days is very unstable, and as a result the level of divorces 

This is a funny question because most women aren’t actually single most men are single. Women do not have a problem getting a man. They have more men than they know what to do with. Sorry but this question made me giggle because it really shows how ignorant this question is towards the imbalance of young men vs young women. Young women are doing just fine, they can get mostly any man that they desire by showing their boobs and being somewhat cute they can easily get a proposal. If a women flashed her boobs in public in front of men, we would all be down to copulate with her we would not care a 

To begin with it is important to define the word ‘decent’. I’ll take the liberty to define the word ‘decent’ as per below for answering the question.  Decent - someone or something that is respectable, modest, proper and kind.   ~ Google Search Somebody decent in today’s times would be a man or a woman who is; decently educated/trained, working and making a living, rational and logical in his/her approach, kind, fair, ambitious yet stays happy, has (flexible) short term and long term plans and is overall a valuable member of the society. I’m a twenty nine years old Indian male. I am unmar 

I'm of the age which is loosely classified as a “senior" millennial. If I'd been born a few months earlier, I wouldn't have made the cut at all. I'm 35, and I'll answer this question excluding the young (people between 18-30), as there are many reasons why they'd still be single during that stretch in their life cycle. After 35, unless you've lived under a rock or in a bubble, most of us have been through a great deal. Life has taught us many lessons, humbled us in a variety of ways, shown us the drastic errors we've made and many character flaws we possess, if we are at all self aware and payin 

I have had a lot of experience with a lot of great people. I do not live with spite, nor am I resentful. I do not have any crazy ex’s that have cheated on me, stolen my pet goldfish or thrown my underwear on the front lawn. In my perspective… Dating and meeting people up until around 2016 was really fun and you could easily get to know someone. People were more — umm, I don’t know exactly how to put this…human back then. Vulnerable, curious, genuinely compassionate and comfortable with their quirks. Trust me when I say there is a night and day difference between then and now. The landscape has rapidl 

Because dating is hard. Actually scratch that, dating is easy but finding one compatible person to date long term is the hard part. Finding someone that checks most of your boxes and matches your dating criteria is difficult. I was single for most of my twenties. I got into my first relationship when I turned 22 and ended things with him when I turned 25 (we spent three years together) I spent the next three years of my twenties single, single but not desperate to find a man. If I could give anyone reading this any helpful piece of advice it would be to figure out what you’re looking for out of 

Why do people cheat on their partners?
I’ve gotten this answer many times. Because handling a one on one relationship is too much pressure. Being monogamous is like a prison sentence and torture for some people. Having one person and only one person makes a man or woman feel trapped. They are not emotionally mature enough to place loyalty verses new conquest or fun on a scale. Some people don’t realize the extent of the other persons moral codes. Some people feel that they aren’t mature enough to devote 100% of themselve to another person. Some people will self sabatoge for the sake of not being something they can’t be. Some people 

Question being addressed: How do people cheat on one another? Hi. I’m Kristin, and I’m going to take you on a journey about how I almost cheated on my husband, whom I love more than life, and to whom I am very attracted, even after 19 years together. If you aren’t in the mood to read mild erotica with some swear words, now would be the time to back away slowly. I’m going to use words to convey the intensity of the situation, and it’s going to get steamy. So I was coming back from my therapist’s office in a nearby city, and I needed to pick up some things for dinner. There was a grocery store (na 

I put this out some years ago as part of a blog I used to publish. It may offer some insights for you.  For some time now I have been debating putting out a Memorable MACKing newsletter that addresses "cheating". Actually, it is because of some discussions with a young woman I work with, that I finally decided I should do it. Let me start out by saying that guys are really bad when it comes to cheating on a woman with whom they are in a relationship. I don't mean "bad" as in being a bad boy, either; rather, dumb as in not understanding how they will likely be caught. On the other hand, women are a 

People cheat on their partners for a myriad of reasons:  [Photo Credit: Ynaija. com] #1 Variety Those who cheat on their partners argue that ‘eating the same diet’ every day can be boring if not outright monotonous. They claim it’s more exciting to eat ‘variety’. Of course, those who think this way have a mentality problem because there’s no correlation whatsoever, between food and sex. In fact, male or female sexual organs have no sense of taste. #2 “Tit-For-Tat” According to many surveys, where a sample of people were asked if they cheated and why they cheated on their partners, they argued that th 

Anon time… I love my wife. I really do. She is my best friend. My absolute BEST FRIEND. She has endometriosis, a condition that prevents her from having sexual intercourse as often as she wishes to.We are still intimate. We still cuddle. We are naked together. And I regularly bring her sexual satisfaction… cuddling, rubbing, massaging, humping, and tongue and finger play. She is happy and satisfied. I take pride in that. I am happy, but NOT satisfied sexually. She takes no pride in that. Her condition cannot be fixed. It can only be coped with. As time passes, she is able to have sexual intercourse 

Many answers here state that people cheat because they are dissatisfied with their current relationship. That is certainly true. However, I do not think that this implies that they do not love their current partner, or do not love them enough. In particular, I think people who cheat do want to continue their current relationship (for good or bad reasons) - otherwise they would just end it.  Let's look at a situation that I find rather common: a person is dissatisfied with their current relationship. They do love their current partner, though perhaps the romantic spark has turned over time into  

Going anonymous because my wife (Janet) visits Quora The situation was common. I love Janet. We have no children, but wanted them. The opportunity arose and I simply could not deny it. I travel for work fifteen to twenty weeks of the year. Many are day trips, with some lasting longer, always during the week. I have a colleague Mel, who I've known professionally for over twenty years as she worked for a separate company. She and I first met at a conference to organize an event, and we would intersect periodically over the years until she finally joined our company. During those prior years, she some 

Because it is in our nature to cheat. It is in our nature to want what we can’t have. It is in our nature to want others to do poorly. It is in our nature to blame, rather than admit fault and soldier on. There are lots of things innate to us which can cause us great harm. Unfortunately, many people still think it’s a good idea to “go with your gut.” In my opinion, this can often be treacherous advice. The Theory of Evolution Logically, from the viewpoint of evolution, men want to cheat because: Getting their seed to as many partners as possible increases their chance of offspring.Thus, if a man felt 

There are a number of reasons involved as to why a person would cheat on their partners or get into an extra-marital affair. But it is not something that is planned. Nobody would want to get into a relationship or marriage with the intent of cheating. People change over time and so do their feelings. Sometimes people haste into saying ‘I do’ or go way too deep while dating. Later on, it seems that the rush of emotions and feelings is just gone. I am penning down some of the reasons according to my knowledge and experience that leads couples or one of them to cheat. If you look around and see so 

[1] So, here I am writing the much awaited second part of my story with Sonam(changed). Those who haven’t read the first part can read it from the link given in the footnotes. After telling my girlfriend that she should not underestimate anyone on the basis of looks only, she looked at me with a blank face. We both quietly sat beside each other for a couple of minutes. After that, this conversation happened. She: Ohh, so she is trying to go out on a date with you. I will show her now. Me: Okay… stop stop. Now what evil thing is cooking in that easy bake oven head of yours! In the meanwhile, one of m 

Is being too honest a sign of low intelligence?
Often the descriptions of academic papers in the popular press exaggerate the original research. A quick google search suggests you are referring to the study by Dr Kang Lee of Toronto university. His study considers children aged between 2 and 16. The youngest children are filmed sitting in a room, where they think they are alone, with a soft toy behind them and told not to look at the toy. When the experimenter returns he asks if they have looked and is able to compare their answers to the reality as recorded on camera. Similar tests are given to the older children. The study concludes that 2 

It depends on the circumstance and relationship dynamics of who you’re being honest with. It may not be a sign of “low intelligence” per se, but it is definitely a sign of low “emotional intelligence” and here’s why: People are massively insecure (sensitive) these days. Arguably more than ever. We constantly rely on social media to validate our lifestyles, opinions, styles, choices, or interests etc. And a large majority of this “validation” is built upon a fabricated spider-web of tempered honesty (borderline lies) very rarely connected to anything truly realistic. At the risk of generalising,

No, because just as what most answers also mentioned, honesty is all about a person's conscious integrity, and it certainly displays a mature character in a person. However, being too honest all the time DOES mean that a person is displaying a sign of low intelligence.  Why is it so?  Because that person is being careless. He is being ignorant regarding the probable consequence that may result from his honesty. He may not try to make effort to understand his opponent's agenda, thus he decides to react honesty as an escape from the responsibility of comprehension.  This is no longer a conscious int 

Yes. There is no exception to this. One thing is for certain - people will always tell other people what they want to hear. And, in some instances, that is okay. Being honest is a great virtue, but it should never be just about being honest. You have to be smart too.  Words can hurt and that is exactly why you should be very careful when being candid to whoever you are talking to. There is an essential difference between being honest for a good cause and being reluctantly honest. If you ask me, being too honest is a sign of low intelligence. Not all people or situations ask for your opinion so you s 

Being too honest could possibly equate with naivete. I once had a much older workmate who seemed to think I was a safe person to share secrets with! He and his wife are both dead now. Their marriage was an excellent partnership, in a way that it showed through to be real.Years before, for some reason, the man admitted to me that, years before, he had an affair with another woman. It did not last long. He had continued his marriage without making this mistake again.My workmate was pondering whether to open up to his wife of many years, admit the betrayal, and get the weight off his conscience 

NO. Being honest is a social construct that aids in the building of trust, which I would argue is the fabric of human social cohesiveness.  Trust is the cornerstone of all relationships and allows us to develop more meaningful, intimate and caring relationships.  Lying for personal gain may get us a nice watch, maybe some gold and diamonds, and a lifetime of loneliness. I'd be curious who authored the study and why.  To me, its a half baked study on many levels. For starters, in my life, the people that lied the most became highly dysfunctional and socially inept because they inevitably DID lose  

No, it is a sign of high integrity. I have known some very intelligent con artists. They used their intelligence to con people out of money, not because they could, but because they wanted to. The thought of getting money through dishonesty gave them a thrill. They were definitely intelligent enough to earn money through honest means, but always chose the dishonest path. It was a character flaw. Very similar to a person with a gambling or drug addiction. The thought of conning people out of money made them high . There is this thought that has permeated our culture that the way to get ahead in l 

I am answering anonymously because this is a very personal topic for me, I have an extremely high IQ around the 170 mark - note that I do not wear this a badge of honour or expect people to impressed, which is why i don’t tell people. However, there’s a misconception that people with exceptionally high Intelligence Quotas lack emotional intelligence. I pride myself more than anything else on the fact that I am deeply empathetic person and have the ability to sense through observation, body language etc people’s moods. I’m the one in friendship groups who always tries to take care of people, and  

First, let me say that being too honest is not a sign of low intelligence. Currently, the question lacks any explanation or comment, but I imagine it’s roughly based on the discussion on the evolutionary basis of intelligence. It is a prevailing idea that sudden spike of human intelligence is about individual trying to gain advantageous position compared to rest of the group. When looked briefly, the idea has some merit. After all, many interaction, when looked at discretely, could be modeled as zero sum games, showing similar traits Prisoner’s Dilemma, where the selfish actions benefits the ind 

I consider myself an honest man and I don’t consider myself to have a low intelligence. It’s just the way I was raised, ever since I was a kid, my mom always told me as long as I’m being honest and not lying, there will be no repercussion regardless of the stupid things that I do. It serve me much better through out the life, because once you start telling a lie, you will need to tell another lie to cover up your earlier lie and you need to keep track of all the lie that you have said earlier. However, there is a limit of being too honest. For example, couple years ago I was out of work and I s 

What does it feel like to be unattractive and desired by none?
Can someone who cheats still love the person they cheated on?
It is impossible to love someone and cheat on them. People who cheat on others are not necessarily bad people (most likely they are), but they definitely know nothing about love. Cheaters are almost always very insecure. They are insecure because they did not experience love, being wanted, in their formative years, so don’t know how profound and deeply affecting it can be. They don’t know love, don’t recognize love, cannot recognize it when someone loves them. They really don’t know what it is, and have insanely unrealistic ideas about it, usually acquired from storybooks and movies. Or from d 

Yes, only when they truly loved the other.I cheated on my first girlfriend ten years ago (when I was say, a boy then).We were very fond of each other, had a really good chemistry, had a good run for two years before I cheated. This left her totally heartbroken, depressed for a very long time, even became suicidal. Eventually she started hating me for the longest time.But I knew I loved her the most and so did she.Ten years later, after a series of unexpected events, we met each other when I was in the country for my vacation.I was a responsible man. She was a dead-drop gorgeous woman. Mor 

Yes you can. Hear me out… I believe cheating is wrong. With a capital “W”. However, sometimes things aren’t as black &amp; white as they might appear. If we’re really honest with ourselves, most things in life exist in shades of grey. Circumstances can never justify, but can (sometimes) make a wrongdoing understandable. I knew this man through work; he was one of my primary vendors. My company spent over half of our annual marketing budget with his company. Needless to say he had a vested interest in staying in front of me; his company encouraged him to wine &amp; dine me since we were a big client. We  

You can love someone and cheat but you cannot be inlove with someone and cheat. Yes they are to diffrent things loving and being in love are not the same. I was married for 12 years.

Going anonymous here. The answer to your question is a resounding “yes”- though that doesn’t diminish the pain and horror of being cheated on. I’m a gay man, and since there are 2 horny bastards instead of just one, it means double the testosterone, and therefore likelihood of cheating. The sad part is, I do believe “cheating” is something that is learned. In my first relationship when I was 19, my first bf cheated on me for years. When he finally told me, it felt like a part of me died- but we were both immature and didn’t know how to have a frank and candid talk about our sexuality. So instead, 

Yes and no. It depends on your reasons for cheating. I cheated on my first husband. The weekend before our wedding we were with friends at a party, when I overheard my husband to be telling his friends how he had some an awesome time with some woman the night before. He was bragging! My world crashed around me, but I made him tell me about it, blow by blow, and it cut deeply with each blow, but some perverse part of me needed to know I could trust him. My measure of trust was whether he could tell the truth. Jonathan drove my father and me to the church that Saturday afternoon, and I remember th 

Well, yes, but that doesn’t exactly mean anything at all. “I cheated on him/her but I still love him/her” is an excuse many cheaters come up with because they want to fool others and (more importantly) their own conscience into accepting a stupid reasoning that doesn’t have any head or tail to stand on. And the reason it is so widely thrown about as an excuse is because there doesn’t actually exist any universal definition of “love”. What exactly is this “love” anyway? To some, late night calls and hours of texting is a way to express “love”. To others, showering gifts and praises, writing poems,  

Yes. I was very much in love with my boyfriend when I cheated. I didn't intend to, but despite my best intentions I had fallen absolutely head over heels in love with someone else and slept with him in a moment of weakness, under the pretense that we would get together instead. Afterwards he just changed his mind and dumped me like a hot potato. It hurt me so much to be in love this other person that I spiralled into a horrible depression, alcoholism and whatnot.

Yes. I love my wife, take my marriage vows extremely seriously, have never cheated on her, don't want to, and don't plan to. I would consider cheating, on my part, to be a massive failure.

Let's say it's nothing serious, and it will get better, but, for the moment, things are awkward and tense between us. I haven't slept in nights due to this and some financial and health concerns.

Why are so many decent people single nowadays?
Distractions. okay here’s the thing, we are obsessed with Hollywood movies and tv shows, whenever it comes to love and relashionships, people think it’s like real life but it’s not, definitely not we’ve seen a loty in the movies about and nerdy nice guy who gets bullied in school , and that bully is dating his high school crush, a beautiful girl. SHe wants to change him to become a good guy, however girls get influenced by these moving (without even realising it) and they start looking for that agressive guy who will treat her like trash , and they’ll keep the decent guy in the friendzone because 

The world has changed . How people are viewed has changed. You come across people who on the outside put up the mask of charm and flattery, who project themselves as the most suitable partners and very soon end up with someone. Problem is with the times - not willing to go too spiritual into answering this question , but just understand that the present YUGA is that of deception .People who are good at deceiving and flattering and flashing usually have their way .They entice the opposite sex easily . The instant attraction bridges the initial hesitation and very soon a new “made for each other”  

Having never lived in any other era I can’t assume that there are more decent single people now than there were. But suppose you are right and more great candidates for relationships are staying alone these days, why might that be? Some have talked about the difficulties of modern dating, and I think that is part of it. But another part is the absolute lack of necessity to partner up. As an educated woman with her own interests, the idea of hitching my life to another’s sounds risky at best. I can buy my own house and save for my own retirement, I have no financial need to find a husband like my 

I am going to fuck with your mind. I use strong language to make my point. If you are easily excited, I suggest you take cover now. Decent people? Is that some sort of a 21st century euphemism for conceited people? We are so complex and smart, are we not? We have evolved from our natural default settings and have learned to mind fuck ourselves. We’re so noble and squeaky clean. What has happened in the last 60 years in our societal evolution is that we have embraced pure selfishness and named it choice. What a load of shit. So, you are decent and you have made the choice to remain single? So, that 

The days of the “routine” of a young girl was to : Get her first job (usually a typing pool/copy typist.Find a boyfriend.Having found the Mr. Right, get married and have first baby.Having returned to work and later had baby II , the expected norm was to “retire” to look after “the children” (In the days when one income could afford run a family of 4 ! )Nowadays: Both men and women want a career these days hence the fall in the number of people who do get married either not starting a family at all, or just have the one baby.Life these days is very unstable, and as a result the level of divorces 

This is a funny question because most women aren’t actually single most men are single. Women do not have a problem getting a man. They have more men than they know what to do with. Sorry but this question made me giggle because it really shows how ignorant this question is towards the imbalance of young men vs young women. Young women are doing just fine, they can get mostly any man that they desire by showing their boobs and being somewhat cute they can easily get a proposal. If a women flashed her boobs in public in front of men, we would all be down to copulate with her we would not care a 

To begin with it is important to define the word ‘decent’. I’ll take the liberty to define the word ‘decent’ as per below for answering the question.  Decent - someone or something that is respectable, modest, proper and kind.   ~ Google Search Somebody decent in today’s times would be a man or a woman who is; decently educated/trained, working and making a living, rational and logical in his/her approach, kind, fair, ambitious yet stays happy, has (flexible) short term and long term plans and is overall a valuable member of the society.

I'm of the age which is loosely classified as a “senior" millennial. If I'd been born a few months earlier, I wouldn't have made the cut at all. I'm 35, and I'll answer this question excluding the young (people between 18-30), as there are many reasons why they'd still be single during that stretch in their life cycle. After 35, unless you've lived under a rock or in a bubble, most of us have been through a great deal. Life has taught us many lessons, humbled us in a variety of ways, shown us the drastic errors we've made and many character flaws we possess, if we are at all self aware and payin 

I have had a lot of experience with a lot of great people. I do not live with spite, nor am I resentful. I do not have any crazy ex’s that have cheated on me, stolen my pet goldfish or thrown my underwear on the front lawn. In my perspective… Dating and meeting people up until around 2016 was really fun and you could easily get to know someone. People were more — umm, I don’t know exactly how to put this…human back then. Vulnerable, curious, genuinely compassionate and comfortable with their quirks. Trust me when I say there is a night and day difference between then and now. The landscape has rapidl 

Because dating is hard. Actually scratch that, dating is easy but finding one compatible person to date long term is the hard part. Finding someone that checks most of your boxes and matches your dating criteria is difficult. I was single for most of my twenties. I got into my first relationship when I turned 22 and ended things with him when I turned 25 (we spent three years together) I spent the next three years of my twenties single, single but not desperate to find a man.

What are some of the things that we take for granted but should not?
If a girl talks about her problems with you, then never take advantage of her emotionally. I had this classmate of mine during my college days. She was a beautiful girl that I used to adore her whenever I get the chance to look at her. I got her intro by a mutual friend of ours and we got to spend some time along with our friends during breaks. (To tell about myself, I was a completely reserved, conservative and Immatured then, I never dare to initiate any conversation as my introversion level was at the peak.) One day she asked my number and we exchanged, that follows casual chats and greeting mes 

Meet Moose, my German Shepherd.  To me, Moose was not only my best friend, but he was probably the best dog I have, and will ever own. You know how they say that a dog is “man’s best friend”? Well, that really was the case with Moose and I. Here we are a couple days after rescuing him from the pound.  After weeks of asking, begging, and pleading, 7 year old buck tooth me just couldn’t hide his excitement after finally owning a furry friend. My parents were initially against buying a dog, since it’s a fair amount of responsibility for a kid. Either way, I managed. On top of that, I walked him frequently, 

Love! And by love, I do not mean romance. That's just another form of love. Here, I am talking about a deeper emotion which binds any two things/people together. Love- Perhaps the source of all other emotions. Even hatred is a form of love, wherein negativity takes over all other things. Enmity for anything, again a negative emotion, is driven by love for some other thing. Indifference is pretense for someone you love. Craving is a yearning for something you love. Love comes in infinite forms, we often fail even to notice. Your mother's concerns about whether you have eaten well or not is pure lov

They both came close after a friend gave intro to her about him. Since then, they both were sharing good bonding, hanging out with each other, sharing their problems together and he was always ready to help her. One day, she called him and started crying, “He doesn’t understand my feelings, he doesn’t care about me.” He is pondering, “Who is he?” She : I like someone, but he doesn’t feel for me. He : Okay, so what do you 

 As I work at a government firm, I can easily answer this question. Everyday I used to find my emplyoees being lazy at work, debating on political affairs amidst the work. This way they take their jobs for granted. One day I made a visit to inspect the condition of medical store where medicines, available by the government for beneficiaries at free of cost were kept. The store keeper was napping on the chair. I clicked his picture taking nap while working. Then I moved on to check the availability of medicines at the store. I found many expired medicines like Paracetamol, Cold Time Total, Cetriz 

A good night’s sleep. I have dealt with sleep disorders and have never ever slept well whole night and not be thankful for it when I have got up. Nothing feels more appealing then being able to sleep when you can’t. If you are able to sleep well, and wake up happy and content, you are enjoying the most delightful experience a human body can have in order to stay sane and sensible. A non-traumatic past. My fb feed is flooded with statuses that talk about loneliness and depression. Today’s relationships are less about discovering each other and life together, and more about getting over the past. 

Your mother, Yes you read that right. It is a reality to mention that everyone's mother is the most underrated superhero in their life. I am not saying that one does not care about her, but here is the thing, which I guess everyone would relate to at some point. We have shouted on her more than once, for no reason, and she said nothing. And we do it very casually, but if it had been someone else, there could have been some serious consequences.We attend to our girlfriend’s or our female friend's requests at once, but happen to ignore our mother's quite frequently.We never formally or informally,

We are living in a period where everything is going so fast that we normally forget to appreciate things which we are privileged to have. Not everyone is blessed with all that we have. If we can't appreciate, then we should try at least to not to take them for granted. Parents - It is my humble request to everyone “Do not take your parents for granted”. They are the reason of your existence. You are living because of them. When you feel happy, they become happy. When you feel sad, they become sad. Parent’s love is the perfect example of selfless love. They happily sacrifice their happiness to s

What caused you to fall out of love with your past lover?
I’m probably going to get a lot of heat for what I’m about to say, but here it is anyway. In today’s world. We get so consumed by our socio-economic statuses and gender inequality that we forget about the reality of biology and how human bodies actually work. Regardless of what people will say, men and women are not equal from a biological standpoint. This doesn’t mean that any one of the genders is better than the other, that’s just simply not true. We are just different. The way our bodies react to circumstances is different in its core. I agree that from a socio-economic standpoint, everyone 

When I first got married, we would be passionate everywhere, if you know what I mean, bed, floor, couch, where ever. We would do things for each other. And we enjoyed each other’s company. She was from Japan I am white american. I learned to speak Japanese and we lived in Japan a few years and life was good. We had kids together, but over the years things grew cold between us. They say that people change and you grow apart. I don’t think either of us changed. I doubt that most people change. What I suspected happened was that I would base my love on how much she loved me and visa versa. If she d 

Nothing, but at the same time, everything. I was with my ex for nine years, and for the last two of those years we were engaged. Engaged to be married? Nope. Engaged in a constant battle with each other. The seven years that led up to that point were amazing. I was bent out of shape from my previous relationship and he was there to heal me. He knew my worries, struggles and stresses but still thought the world of me. He made me feel beautiful when the whole world rejected me. (I'm not very attractive, never have been.) I lost my virginity to him, and even if he didn't lose his to me, he exclaime 

This is a story I never thought I would tell. The man I was set to marry before my current marriage turned out to be a maniac. We were together for four years and I loved almost every minute of it. He took me on expensive dates, we went on expensive holidays, and his family absolutely adored me. My mother adored him but my dad was always a bit suspicious of him and his intentions and told me to watch my back. My dad has always trusted his gut and it has never failed him, so this initially worried me. We started dating when I was around 21 and he proposed to me on my 23rd birthday. I reluctantly s 

I loved my ex-husband more than words can express. He was a passionate and intelligent, handsome and charming. He treated me well. Even our disagreements were mild. Two weeks before our wedding, he became angry with me. I don’t remember why. I don’t think it was over anything that was important or I’d remember. Anyway, he said horrific things about me while he was angry and broke my heart completely. I told my friends and family that I was calling off the wedding because I couldn’t marry a man who could be so cruel toward me. I was more hurt than I had ever been by anyone before. The things he  

I was married before to my daughter’s biological father. Things started out ok, but as the years passed, I learned that it wasn’t necessarily ME that he loved; it was more of a case that anyone could be me and married to him, and this became quite clear to me. That was what most of our fights were about towards the end. Gradually, with each passing day, more and more evidence came to light that he got this “job position” filled by whomever was willing to have sex with him at the time. I was a bit naïve and did not want to believe this about him. It got to a point where he had gone on a little  

I met my ex in the 9th grade, we became really close friends. Towards the end, I started falling for him and he hinted he liked me too. In the 10th grade, I asked him out and we dated for about a year. He was my best friend, and the one guy I truly loved. During junior year, I had to move to a different country, distance at first was not an issue but being a junior in high school balancing both work and a relationship was hard. He was really depressed that I moved in the beginning, months later, he started hanging out with guys who'd skip classes and smoke. And note, he was the type of guy who w 

The only person I truly 'fell out of love with' was my third girlfriend. I started dating her a few months after being devastatingly dumped by who I thought was 'the one' at that time in my life. She wasn't particularly attractive, or motivated, and she was a good candidate for a rebound relationship while I pinned for my ex. I know that sounds horrible, but I didn't realize I was doing that to her at the time (I realized it right before I split with her). She was funny and we enjoyed a lot of the same things…namley video games, drinking, and smoking weed. I was 22 at the time, she was twenty.  

He was my best friend. He was my first best friend. I never had a best friend in my life till then. I prefered staying alone , reading books , studying for exams , winning competition. I always got 1st rank in class . Head Girl of school . Basically a nerd . He was everything I wanted in friend . I eventually started falling in love with him . And then there was my friend ( girl ) .They two were the only friends in my life then. I never really wanted to tell him that I loved him because I was too scared and of course I did not want to ruin our friendship. Eventually my friend started pressuring

As time passes, as she enjoy her freedom some part of her tries 

When did you find out your spouse loves you even more than you thought?
I have been married for 7 years. It has been a beautiful journey with lots of love and silly fights. My husband doesn’t show his love through words but his actions. There are many incidents where I feel he loves me more than I realize. Few days after our marriage, we were roaming in the busy roads, enjoying street food. Suddenly I felt a lot of pain in my toes because of the newly worn toe ring. It was pretty tight and I was not able to walk. I told my husband, instantly he kneeled down before me in the busy roads with insane crowd, took my feet in his hands and gently pulled off my toe ring! I 

I had gotten out of a bad relationship when I was 23 due to him cheating and had trust issues. I had been with him for 7 years and I felt betrayed. I went three years being single after that. When I was 26 I went to a friend’s wedding. I was the only one among my friends who was single. I felt depressed and went outside to smoke, just thinking I’d be alone with my cats for the rest of my life when I hear a voice: “Are you ok?” I looked up into the face of Conor. I knew him back in school but we weren’t friends. He had special needs but wasn’t confident enough to make friends, thinking he was us 

Well, I knew he cared about having me in his life and he loved me deeply.. Firstly, I knew where his loyalties lie when he stood up to my family, and fought for my safety. He believed that I had every right to choose whom I should marry and not be coerced or blackmailed to follow what they believe to be true. Second, I knew he loved me when we were in the process of applying for the green card, this was after we were married (so that I could keep staying in the US, with him). When you begin the process of application, you are not allowed to leave the country. After they have made the decision, t 

We were married for almost 15 years before we had children, When Dan our youngest was two, he suffered from severe regressive autism. He went from speaking (albeit less than the normal) and smiling, from holding your face in his hands and planting a kiss- to rocking on his bed and banging his head, not just speechless but soundless- unable to even babble; from affectionate to attacking his older brother, and really only able to gain any solace at night, but this required someone co-sleeping with him and squeezing him so that he could calm down. We had to sue the school system- they stated that  

Not my spouse but my girlfriend. We are together since more than five years now. One year ago I decided that I wanted to leave from my home country (France) to live and study one year in Australia. Definitely not the closest country that I could have pick up. But even knowing that she supported and encouraged me while I told her that I wanted to leave alone (the most selfish decision of my life). Indeed, I thought that I was at a key point of my life where I had to take a radical decision to achieve my life aims and figure out who I am by going through this kind a big life challenge.

When my parents learned about him they took my phone and almost all means of communication, treated me like garbage and threatened me with many things. They came to me and said “you're an idiot if you think he'll still be with you after things got serious. He was just toying with you". I just had to rely on my faith in him. And one month later he was in Kuwait to see me and my family.When I was hospitalized for my mental breakdown he called everyone in my family and constantly asked about me.He paid thousands and thousands of dollars to com

Couple of months after we got married. One weekend afternoon, just before spring, my husband and I were unwinding ourselves on the couch, talking without any agenda. We were chit chatting, and every now and then, he would wipe his forehead and nose. I noticed sweat dropping from his forehead. I thought we both were cool and comfortable with the temperature we had set for our house, which was– ahem… 77–79F. Disclaimer- Pleasant weather for you may be borderline cold for me, and cold for you is my chillliiiiiing. Plus I have this thing, some symptoms of which a doctor once termed as ‘cold allergy’.  

The day he cried for me. So, the story goes like this. We had an arranged marriage. We barely knew each other and in 2 months we were married. Immediately after our wedding, I fell sick and had to be hospitalized for quite a few days. And by the time I recovered it was almost 2 months post our wedding. So, even after the wedding, we barely spent time with each other. Though, by this time I had fallen in love with him head over heels. Fast forward another 2 months, we were just about getting used to living with each other, adjusting to our new lives with each other, me getting used to my conservati

I thought I was the luckiest girl in the world. We started trying for a baby and going to an infertility clinic as I have serious fertility issues 

Well!! The man is still not my husband but I am sure he will going to be the Best Husband. About a month ago we got engaged after 1 year of courtship.

How do married people stay in love with their spouse when they are old, wrinkled, and grey?
I’m not quite wrinkled yet but I’m definitely past mid-life so the grey hairs have well and truly taken over. My husband and I have now reached the point where we’ve been together longer than we’ve lived apart. We met in Santorini, Greece, a few decades ago, when neither of us were necessarily looking to fall in love. He was on his way to Gallipoli to visit his great grand-father’s grave, while I had just finished university in France and wanted to spend the rest of my summer in Greece. He was the first person I remember meeting on my second day on the island. I suppose everybody was new and i 

Hmmm… let me try to answer this. When I first met my wife I thought she was crazy beautiful. I was not, however, in love with her. I didn’t know her but saw her from afar. To me she was like beautiful art. Truly gorgeous. Then I got to know her. We became best friends first. No sexual relationship. Just friends. I then learned that she was truly beautiful inside also. This is why I began to fall in love with her. It was not because of her looks, it was because of the person she is. So now we have been married for 27 years. Perhaps she is not as physically beautiful as she was back then. She is, h

I can only speak for myself and not for old, married couples. I’m still young and unmarried, but here’s my input anyway. I do not plan to marry any woman for her physical appearance. I want a woman with a certain type of personality and mindset. Physical appearances change over time, but good personalities can remain the same or even improve as spouses grow older. I will always associate my future wife’s physical appearance with her positive qualities which I’ll greatly treasure for life. When she’s old, wrinkled and grey, we will have spent so much time together and experienced so many positiv 

When I met my now wife, she was a young 26year old with long blond hair, she was the most beautiful person I had ever seen and way out of my league. Anyway I started to chat to her online, it was wonderful even though I was 16 years her senior she made me feel at ease with all we talked about, I had just come out of a loveless relationship and honestly thought I would be alone for the rest of my life. As time passed I grew close to her Sam, and looked forward to getting home from work every day so I could log on and chat to her, I would tell her about my day and she would tell me about hers, I  

You begin by choosing your partner wisely. You don't settle. You must ask yourself: Is this person the love of your life? Is this person someone you find difficult to be apart from? Is this someone who compliments you and your lifestyle? I've heard people say about the companion they're with, “She's (or he's) a good person.” Yes, that's all well and good, but it's not enough. Do they light a fire of passion within you? Do you find it hard to keep your hands off them? Next month, my wife and I will celebrate 47 years of marriage, although we've been together a lot longer having met when we were 

Being in love isn't the same thing as being in lust. All people get old and grey if they are lucky, there is no avoiding that. There is also no human right that states that we all deserve to be with someone that stays hot for their entire life. Doesn't it sound silly to expect that when you think of it that way? Everyone would be single, that's not even feasible. When you love someone, you like their personality and being with them. That doesn't necessarily go away. If you were attracted to them in the beginning, that attraction is strengthened by love. An old grey husband still looks like his y

What is love?  Like, love, or ‘in love’? Psychological research over the past 50 years has investigated the differences between liking someone, loving someone, and being “in love”. Liking is described as having positive thoughts and feelings towards someone and finding that person’s company rewarding. we frequently also experience warmth and closeness towards the people we like. In some instances, we elect to be emotionally intimate with these people.  When we love someone we experience equivalent positive thoughts and experiences as once we sort of a person.

  Meet this man- Arunachalam Muruganantham, the man who wore a sanitary pad to break a taboo. He defined love not by his words(which anyone can do) but by his actions(which very few can do). He showed what true love really means and he did that by showing his love towards his wife by providing the permanent solution for her wife's problem.

What things are romanticized but shouldn't be?
‘Fixing’ people.  Especially in romantic relationships. I see this in countless romances in the media. A broken bad boy is haunted by his horrible past, but sweet Mary Sue will put up with his borderline abusive behavior. After time he will become a changed man, and actually treat her like a human being. How adorable. Now I know you’re thinking ‘okay, but everyone knows those romances are trash’. Yes, but there’s subtler versions too. How many times have you seen a couple where the girl is ‘supportive’ towards her troublesome boyfriend? It even has tv trope!  The problem is that many people (men an 

The “Glorious Revolution”.  Liberty Leading the People by Eugene Delacroix It’s one of the most common focal points in media is to glamorize revolution. The idea of a great social upheaval to overthrow a tyrannical government. This usually centers around a movement that consists of a diverse array of peoples who are intent on uniting and creating a better system of government. The end result is rebellion.  In the Star Wars original trilogy we see this as a ragtag “Rebellion” seeks to overthrow the “Evil Empire”.  It’s a romantic concept. Noble characters crusading for the sake of simply doing the rig 

In order to effectively use the word “should in a sentence, one has to imply a reason that one “should” or “should not” do something. To simply ask what things are romanticized that shouldn’t be, you have to give us a reason to answer it relative to. If there is ever any benefit derived from romanticizing something, it should therefore be romanticized…if you want that something to happen. Without motivation for or against something in an explicit context, you find yourself shoulding all over things that may not be worthy of said should.

Pirates:  Pirates have definitely been romanticized throughout the years. From books, movies, tv shows, etc, they have been made to be seen as swashbuckling heroes, or anti-heroes in search of the ‘freedom’ they get from roaming the high seas in search for glory and treasure. While in reality, many pirates did turn to piracy for a better life, at the end of the day a pirate was a pirate and they were ruthless, occasionally barbaric, and stole and murdered their way to infamy.

The thing that shouldn't be romanticized in my opinion, being a woman, is love and marriage and romance itself. I know things are changing for the better however, being as many parents are still assigning roles specific to their birth sex, many girls are still fed the “fairy tale" about growing up and getting married. Men are still fed the ideals of a perfect woman. The one they bring home to mom. This gives women the wrong idea that a man is supposed to do things that support a woman's literal life. Protection, shelter, food. It gives men the idea they are solely responsible for these things.

Nearly everything these days is romanticised. “Chinese take-out night tonight!” So you’ve dedicated 6 hours after-work to eat a Chinese? I don’t know about you, but when I have take-out, it isn’t some cosy night in by a fire place, sitting on a fur rug accompanied by fondu for after the meal. I sit at my kitchen table, scoff down as much chips mixed with noodles and crispy beef as I can. The whole process usually takes about 10 minutes, of which the food after that time is usually cold and the curry has started to solidify. Once I’ve had the food, I’m reminded about the money I’ve thrown away to s 

What exactly made you fall in love with a completely different country's culture? Why?
What things are romanticized but shouldn't be?
‘Fixing’ people.  Especially in romantic relationships. I see this in countless romances in the media. A broken bad boy is haunted by his horrible past, but sweet Mary Sue will put up with his borderline abusive behavior. After time he will become a changed man, and actually treat her like a human being. How adorable. Now I know you’re thinking ‘okay, but everyone knows those romances are trash’. Yes, but there’s subtler versions too. How many times have you seen a couple where the girl is ‘supportive’ towards her troublesome boyfriend? It even has tv trope!  The problem is that many people (men an 

The “Glorious Revolution”.  Liberty Leading the People by Eugene Delacroix It’s one of the most common focal points in media is to glamorize revolution. The idea of a great social upheaval to overthrow a tyrannical government. This usually centers around a movement that consists of a diverse array of peoples who are intent on uniting and creating a better system of government. The end result is rebellion.  In the Star Wars original trilogy we see this as a ragtag “Rebellion” seeks to overthrow the “Evil Empire”.  It’s a romantic concept. Noble characters crusading for the sake of simply doing the rig 

In order to effectively use the word “should in a sentence, one has to imply a reason that one “should” or “should not” do something. To simply ask what things are romanticized that shouldn’t be, you have to give us a reason to answer it relative to. If there is ever any benefit derived from romanticizing something, it should therefore be romanticized…if you want that something to happen. Without motivation for or against something in an explicit context, you find yourself shoulding all over things that may not be worthy of said should. (For those whose primary language is not English, I am us 

 The “college/university” experience.  After spending (wasting) six years of my life at Dalhousie University only to wind up with a useless BA that isn’t even recognized let alone accepted by most employers, being twenty-something years old and feeling like the best of my youth is drying up, I’m just tired. I think I now know what a “quarter-life crisis” is. I’m going to do an apprenticeship and get a job that actually pays well. Here’s the thing: I’m not trying to dissuade people from university, if it’s really what they want to do, but is it? We’re told all through high school that these formativ 

Pirates:  Pirates have definitely been romanticized throughout the years. From books, movies, tv shows, etc, they have been made to be seen as swashbuckling heroes, or anti-heroes in search of the ‘freedom’ they get from roaming the high seas in search for glory and treasure. While in reality, many pirates did turn to piracy for a better life, at the end of the day a pirate was a pirate and they were ruthless, occasionally barbaric, and stole and murdered their way to infamy. For example, François l'Olonnais once cut open the chest of one his captives and ate his heart. Ed Low, known for cruelty 

Toxic relationships.  I hate that movie with a PASSION. Once I watched the first movie, I was DONE. I had decided to forget about that disaster of a movie, but then we got the sequel that NO ONE asked for, but we still got. Most people have watched After and After We Collided, and maybe some of you like it. Maybe some of you even want a relationship like Hardin and Tessa. No. First of all fuck you, and second, do you see how screwed up this movie is? Let’s get with the facts. This movie is based off of a Harry Styles fanfiction.

Do you have an amazing story of how you met your husband/wife/partner that defies the odds?
I saved this question until today, because it's a day worths remembering. This day exactly four years ago, May 12, 2012, I met my husband for the very first time. I had a trip to Taiwan with two of my very good friends from Malaysia. And my husband travelled there with two of his buddies from Hong Kong. We both arrived on May 11, 2012. Went to the same club, Luxy on the first night, but we didn't see each other. I remember I was very drunk that night, puked in the cab and my friends had to literally drag me back to our Airbnb, cleaned me up and put me to bed. The next morning I woke up with a massi 

When I was 19 I got added on facebook one day by a stranger who lived in Lebanon. I couldn’t see his pictures, just his profile picture which was of a cartoon character. I looked at his profile page to see if maybe there was some hint as to where I might know him from. There was nothing. But his ‘about me’ and likes were so interesting. Now, I’m someone very interested in foreign countries. I had been living abroad my whole life. But I had only met one other person from Lebanon, so my knowledge of the country was limited. So I decided to write him. I told him that I didn’t know who he was and a 

When I was 10 years old I suddenly declared to my mother that I wanted to learn Japanese and that she must find me a teacher. We lived in a very Caucasian town in rural Australia - there were few Asians, let alone Japanese. My mother was understandably surprised but figured she should ride with it. An ad in the newspaper later, we somehow managed to locate the only Japanese person in town. And so it was that I came to speak enough Japanese to win myself a scholarship there for a year, which pretty much sealed the deal - I was officially a Japanophile. Meanwhile, my husband-to-be was in rural Ja 

Yup, that's right up my alley! About four years ago, I was a final year student in one of the best French prep schools. I don't know if you've ever heard of French prep schools, but that's no joke: study all the time, not very encouraging professors, and constant stress. Needless to say, I was pretty depressed. My two best friends and I decided to take a short break during the October holidays and go to Dublin. We stayed at the Times Hostel on Camden Place for 5 days. During these 5 days, the three of us got enough attention from the opposite sex, but it I simply didn't really like anyone, and w 

 Oh this one could only happen in the movies… except it didn’t. It happened in real life. I feel most qualified to tell this story from my perspective as an involved observer. Here goes, settle in: My daughter needed to escape her situation. She graduated college early, at 19, but had no idea what to do with herself. She became a virtual magnet for disaster in which bad people and problems just gravitated her way. She’d always try her best, always. Yet the harder she tried the more her life twisted—headed downward from bad to worse. After her latest relationship nearly ended her life, I suggested  

Similar to many, I spent my life dreaming of The One. Although I loved many wonderful people, I always eventually broke it off whenever I realized they were not The One. By the time I was 37, I was beginning to question my desire - is there really one true soulmate for me in the world? I was dating a lovely person at the time, but I had realized (once again) that we were not destined to be together in the long run. Maybe it was time for me to accept that my love life might consist of one long-term relationship after another, and that I should be fine with that, OR, to be satisfied with less-th 

My brother had invited me to a party with his friends. On the day, I was feeling pretty tired and couldn’t be bothered to go. My friend and I decided to show our faces for a little bit, to be polite. When we arrived, we still weren’t really in the party mood. Everyone was a lot more drunk than we were. We hung around outside in the smoking area, in that awkward, too self conscious to talk to anyone kind of mood. We decided we’d leave more or less straight away, but my friend wanted to roll a cigarette first, and she asked me to go inside and find her some papers. She knew even less people at the 

We met 16 years ago.I am  Mexican and my wife is Japanese. She is 6 years older than me and I met her when I was 15 years old(She was 21 then). Imagine the age difference at this age.  Long story short, I went to Vancouver for 6 months to study English(which actually was a sabbatical semester). Last Friday of my stay, I went to a party which was at a friend's house who was also Japanese. She was there and of course when I looked at her I liked her but of course I never had the intention to talk to her. She was much older than me and I thought she wouldn't talk to me.  A friend of mine who was a 

We were childhood friends. He was 2 years my senior. He was there when my first tooth came off. He consoled me after my ears were pierced. We looked really cute together. But I am a Hindu and he a Muslim. Not that our families are orthodox in anyway but I always had this seed of doubt in my mind. So I was always had my guard up around him. Enter my best friend. She met him on my 14th b'day and was completely blown away by him. I thought they were the best match. Same ethnicity, same b'day and my friend was stunning, I mean they both were. So I set out playing cupid. But he was just not interes 

We met by chance while I was working in North Carolina. At the time I was working at a big chain bakery store after my immigration to the U.S. My manager had asked me if I could work overnights so we could stay one step ahead of cake orders, and also so I could prepare the bakery before opening (baking bread, donuts, markdowns etc). It had been about 2 weeks of this new schedule. The bakery was due for some major renovations, which would happen during the night so as not to disturb the normal workflow. The renovation company sent in a team of workers. In addition, they sent along a security guard 

What are some psychological facts about love?
Giving a woman independence is a love paradox. The more independence you give her, the more she feels drawn to you.Surprising a woman with intimate gifts like a negligee, new panties or a bra triggers the same feelings of love like just before the first sexual encounter.You can easily know if a woman loves you by looking at her body language when another woman is looking at you while smiling.You can easily rekindle a dead relationship by frequently spending time together at a camping site, a trip, adventure, or going to a picnic.Women experience psychological pleasure first before they experie

Limerence is the technical term for having a crush on a person.After learning the name of your crush, does it suddenly appears everywhere? It’s like he/she is haunting you? It’s called The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon or also known as frequency illusion. It’s a type of cognitive bias your mind creates. Have you experienced this phenomenon?If you love someone, your brain overlooks and ignores the flaws of that person causing them to appear perfect.Shy people tend to be more modest which is considered an attractive trait by many.Love inspires creativity. It changes how you think. It opens your mind

We have collected for you as many as eight life hacks that are applicable not only during quarrels, but even during a conversation about what to cook for dinner or what's new to try in bed. In principle, it would be enough to write the words "mutual respect" and "ability to listen", but we will reveal the topic – just in case. DO NOT GENERALIZE Phrases that begin with the words " you always (do so)" and "you never (do not listen to me)" doom any, even the most innocent dispute to a sad end. When you use these expressions, you let the partner know that he is, first, not a very good person, and se 

Some psychological facts about love are: -The one who cries with you in your pain can never leave you. -Most of the single person in teens are secret lovers or maybe one side lover as well. -Looking in strangers eyes more frequently can lead them and you both to fall in love. -When you hold the hand of the one you love, it reduces both mental and physical pain. -Seeing the beloved picture provides a kind of relief. -Sometimes love can be addictive too. If so it's better to get rid of it as fast as possible -Sometimes loves decreases the power of vision. They tend to understand only things that they i 

I don’t like using the words “hack” and “love” in the same sentence, however, there are some points which I can propose from my personal experience and practice: Never make major decisions about the relationship in the state of anger. We all get a little flustered sometimes with our better halves, and it’s easy to say/do something you don’t actually mean in the heat of an argument. My “hack” for this is – just remember that the person who you are arguing with IS the love of your life (hopefully), and is it really worth arguing about something which, most likely, isn’t worth arguing in the first

Women fall in love with love, the story, the fairytale, especially when they teen and those who don’t get out of that, get hurt the most because they don’t fall in love with the man but the validation not the man.Men fall in love with the arousal then the woman. If man doesn’t realise that then he won’t know how to keep the fire burning but think like most women, it just happens, like magic.Attraction isn’t a choice. It is instant, with what you see and you know nothing about the person even if someone is in self denail and believes they can read someone’s life story and personality from what 

It's often easier for us to think that the people we're after are more attractive than the people who pursue us on their own initiative.Body language is the first thing we attract each other (smile, wiggle hair, eye contact, etc.). The tone of a voice can affect attractiveness, women with higher voices attract more men, and men with lower voices attract more women.We found that people with more symmetrical faces are more attractive.Hormone levels, that is, high estrogen levels attract more men, while high testosterone levels attract more women.It's easier to have love in dangerous situations, a

Women give physical boundaries to those they like as a test to see if you are trying to take advantage of them, trying to one and done her, or she does this for her own self respect. But for everything I’m about to tell you below, it is all in how you react when she tells you no. If you grovel, you lose. Show her you don’t care if you have sex or not, and stay cool, she will appreciate this and most likely sleep with you anyway if she wants. Because there is no longer pressure. And she feels attracted because you aren’t chasing her for the one thing she has power over you for. Show her she can

Did you know that there is a lot more to love than meets the eye?  some psychological facts about love that can help you determine if you believe your partner would find you as attractive as you do? One of the psychological facts about love that is often overlooked is that we look at a physical appearance in a different way than we do personality. We tend to look for physical looks in a mate more so than the person's overall personality. If you notice that your partner has a nice facial skin tone or has a nice hairstyle that suits her, this can be a big turn off to her. You might be surprised at h 

Basic psychology of Love (next time be specific of the topic, it is vast and you got 2000 years of history behind it) Apply all this to the triangle given below. I) men fall in love in a minute but woman takes more than 15 days II) Physical attributes plays major part in love (Anthropological View of Love ) ( people who have healthier genes are said to beautiful and handsome and partner prioritize them) Co lour and race doesn't matter (as long every human is attracted to their own race, though there may preferences and priority at the end the of the day they find their race, colour sexier) Example: 

Which is the most complicated relationship or love story you have come across?
I am the result of my mother’s biggest heartbreak. When my mother was younger, my grandparents used to host exchange students from all over the world. My mother is the youngest sibling of four. My granma gave birth to her seven years after the last boy, making her a lot younger than the rest. Being the only girl, she was daddy’s little girl. She was spoiled rotten by both her brothers and her father, but because of the year gap she was also kept home a lot and not allowed as much as her brothers. Every summer a new exchange student came, and my mother was usually left behind at home when her oth 

Long Story !! In 2013 I rejected a boy who is a great friend of mine. that time I was also single.But I rejected him for my caste and parents.I offered him a lifetime friendship ... and I was seriously mean it. He agreed to my condition and we started hanging out with no expectation. But suddenly one day He confronted me about his feelings once again .. and his insecurities towards me. He thought I might like someone else.I explained him that there is no one in my life.. and i have very few friends whom I can trust blindly. But he quit. He told me that it's totally uncomfortable situation for hi 

It all started in school. We were classmates. He was the most jolly like person and no one I say NO ONE could resist smiling around him. The best days of my life… I joined that school in 8th standard, but different section and made so many friends from both the sections but not even once in a year I noticed him. I never got a chance maybe or I was really shy or hesitant to go and spent time in different section. Year passed and we got promoted to 9th standard and same section. We instantly became friends and he started trying to set me up with one or the other guy friend of his. (All of them ask 

:) I feel ridiculous that I am sharing mine. I was married at 25, a typical Indian arranged marriage with all the usual drama. Horoscope matching and all. I had never thought about falling in love. Never really thought I was capable of it. For me, marriage is what I saw of my parents. Just two people living together, raising kids, with defined sets of responsibilities and that’s it. Grow old and die. I had no expectations from marriage. I hoped that inevitably I would fall in love with the one I married. But then, after a dozen years, that never really happened. The funny thing is that my spous 

Loved a broken girl ,who I thought is not mature enough to understand the cruel world but I was wrong !!!! I met this girl who was younger to me by almost 6 years. She looked cute and even her talks were. I handed my number to her on pretext of getting some info but didn't take hers. After 2 days, I got a message from her. We slowly began chatting and soon we were busy talking to each other for hours on phone. Initially I didn't have any feelings for her. Then she told me about a guy, who she met at her office 6 months back and in 10 days they got committed. I was literally shocked because no one 

Someone I know used to tell his stories.. I never understood him when it came to love, relationships or even s**. He was in a relationship with this girl during his graduation. ie., for 2 years. When he had made up his mind of marrying her, he had a physical relationship with his one of his classmate and he was totally ok with it.. After his graduation, the girl with whom he was in a relationship got placed in another city.. he followed her to that city and just after 2 weeks, she broke up with him saying that there was no future/scope in his career and he moved out. He didn’t even confront her.  

LSDR: I was in love with a girl (who was also a friend). Her boyfriend asked her to end her friendship with me. She stopped talking to me when he forced her a lot. I fell in love with her best friend after a year. We are married now since last 7 years and that is the best thing that has happened to me. My wife and my crush are still best friends. But we have not spoke to each other since that day. We get together a lot of times, but I cannot get over the fact that she would end her friendship because of someone else’s wish. Worst part for her - her boyfriend dumped her for someone else a month be

The year was 2011. She joined my school. We were in Class 11, she had science, I had commerce. School began in July. But the first time she had my attention was in August. We were in the same house. I had been in the school since nursery. Her previous school was till 10th, she and her group (total 4 girls) joined our school. Our birthdays are 3 days apart.

Have you ever accidentally encountered your ex, several years after you parted? If so, what was the reaction?
It was the last night that I would ever see her alive. And it was also the last kiss we ever shared.  What I never wrote about, and now, I think it’s finally time, is the last night we were truly alone together. This wasn’t so much an accidental encounter, as an unconsciously willing one.  It’s 2002. She had been married to my oldest friend for 10 years. She was the mother to a 9 year old boy and a 7 year old girl who were both named after me (first and middle name). I was visiting in the area, a 2 day layover in the long trip home after a long stint working overseas. I was visiting family and deci 

YES. It was in the gym. Thanks to my myopia I didn't recognise him on the spot -he was something like 5 meters away- but I did notice the resemblance of the figure.. and there we was. My heart actually skipped a beat. For a second, it was like we never parted… same accellerated heart beats, same dizziness.. and just like that, it ended. We both went on with the training and didn't even greet. We parted after a 5 years relationship, I was 18 and he was 22 soon to be 23 when it started. We were DEEP in love, to be honest I think I'll never love anyone like I loved him. We used to dream about our fut 

Yes! Backstory: I discovered that my ex had been having *one and done* encounters since we had been married. Then, i find out he has started an actual affair. Then, as if those werent enough..i come home unexpectedly to find my best friend in my bed with him. She was his affair. I was shattered. Took my dog and left immediately. He pleaded with me not to go..that he loved me and the affair was only a piece of ass.. I said in response *a damn big piece of ass*. I encouraged him to tell me that he loved me so that she could hear because I wanted her to feel the pain and always to remember his words 

Let tell you a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down…Okay jokes aside, yes I actually ran into the man I was engaged to a couple of years after we had a very bad break up. Now I won’t go into the nasty details because at the end of the day we both made peace thanks to the run in. But for back story, I was 18 years old, I joined a roleplaying site for anime and nerd roleplay stuff. Yes I am a roleplaying via text. I enjoy it. I still do it. Infact I’m still on the site. I found him and the site on a whim via google. And joined in my senior year of highschool. I enjoyed the si 

I ran into my ex last week in Bangkok. It was awkward, to say the least. For background I’m an expat, posted in Thailand for several years, then to Beijing and then back to Thailand. My ex is a very wealthy Thai girl who was a university student at the best school in Thailand when we were dating and had just graduated when we broke up. We broke things off because I was moving to China. It wasn’t an awful breakup but there were definitely some hard feelings on her end. Honestly I felt bad myself. She’s absolutely gorgeous and very smart and we had a lot of fun together. This was 3 years ago. I  

This wasn't several years later, but my ex and I broke up in 2016, I joined the military in 2018 and started my current relationship Dec 2018, at this point my ex had completely removed me from all social media and we had had no contact in almost 2 years. A few months into 2019 I moved 600 miles away for work, but my girlfriend stayed. So being the one who made more money I traveled to her when I could. She was in college so I would attend her classes with her and participate in class discussions, since I had nothing better to do. Surprisingly on the way to one of her classes I saw my ex walking 

I was with someone on and off for two years back in 2014. At the tail end of 2014, I sent him (Let’s call him Pete*) an email (which is how he broke up with me twice during those two years) explaining that I knew I wanted more from him than he wanted and that the last two years I had been lying to myself thinking he would magically become the person I wanted him to be. I told him that I loved him and that I always would. I ended the email by asking him not to reply because I didn’t want to re-read his email over and over again as it would be too painful for me. He obliged. I had seen him in pas 

When my ex and I broke up in 2014, we were still in love. My mother decided she didn’t approve of our relationship, so we were forced to split at the age of 14 and I was moved to a different town. She shipped me off to my hometown in FL for the summer and turned off my phone service so that i could not have contact with said ex. I even tried mailing letters, but my aunt took them out of the mailbox and told my mother about it. When I came back to TN, I was brought back home 3 different times at the age of 15 for taking my mother’s car in the middle of the night as I was attempting to see him aga 

I have either accidentally or on purpose encountered all my exes several years or even several lifetimes after we parted because of reincarnation, or the ebb and flow of all living things. For example, my Husband No. 2 passed away some years ago. However, in some of my dreams or nightmares he appears as my mother. My husband No. 1 was my brother in previous lifetimes. After all the romance faded, we were siblings and/or best friends. These other examples aren’t exes, at least in this current lifetime, but my daughter has been my sister in several lifetimes. This is a very strong connection becaus 

Yes, and it was hilarious! After 5 years of dating, and 14 years of marriage, my Ex finally realized that I would not ever allow her to be in complete control, and said that she “wanted out of the marriage”. After a semi-nasty divorce that took 6 months, and another 2 months for me to find a new home, I went on my way. Since we did not have kids, it would be a clean break. (Although I did essentially raise her son from her first marriage, but that’s another story) I moved to a new home about 6 miles away. About 2 years later she showed up at my door unannounced (and most definitely uninvited) to 

What will make a narcissist start valuing his ex-partner again or possibly want her again?
I assume you're asking this because you want to feel wanted again. Trust me, I just broke out of this headspace a few weeks ago, and I broke up with my ex over 6 months ago. I know this isn't what you want to hear, but I'm going to say it anyway. Hypothetically, there are plenty of ways a narcissist wants his ex back for a refresh of supply. This does not mean he will change, or stay with her, or that she will be enough to satisfy his impossible insatiable need for fuel. I'll just tell you my story so you can see what I mean. The year I was with my ex we broke up at least 7 time. (All but one wer 

What will make a narcissist start valuing his ex-partner again or possibly want her again? Several things. However, I’ll list 2 reasons, I believe, a Narcissist will re-idealize (they don’t value anyone) a target… He’s out of/low on supply. One of many reasons people cannot get closure from narcissistic relationships, is because narcissists do not end relationships. They take breaks from them. Many narcissists cannot be alone. They need a constant flow of attention/energy because they cannot generate their own. They’re empty vessels living in a perpetual state of need. So, they collect people an

Okay so my ex narcissist Chinese wife I was married to for 12 years three and a half years ago came to me one day out of the blue and said I Don't Love You No More we can never be husband and wife and I want a divorce and divorced me 15 months ago. All have time she constantly would blame me 100%, saying because I had a wonderful life together and I ruined it etcetera etc etc. 3 months ago when I lost my phone and had to get a new phone I messaged her and said I lost my phone here's my new phone number and email in case of emergency and that was it. She replied saying I'm so disappointed in yo 

Look really good, grow bigger in your career and increase your salary to where you make enough money to live in a nice place, be attentive, loving &amp; remind the narcissist how great wonderful, charming &amp; smart he is. When he mistreats you and argues with you even if you are not at fault, argue back, yell at him , tell him he is unfair, mean, irrational, while doing this make sure you put a lot of emotion into it because there is no fuel without the emotion put behind the words, which defeats the purpose of the arguement to begin with. When that moment passes &amp; he decides he wants some of your p 

When or if they get lonely for one thing. They hate to be alone. And I mean hate it. They cannot be inside their own heads for even five minutes. So if they are attractive and can easily replace you it could take a long time or never happen. I knew he was reaching out to an ex the week before he made contact with me for the first time. Later during a time he was smearing her to me I looked at him and said you make no sense. Here you are saying all these bad things about her, yet the week before you contacted me for the first time she told me you called her no less than 8 or 9 times. He got a d 

Honestly, everything I see here is super negative and hopeless. I know NPD are hard to treat based on the articles I've read but I do wish the opposite. I just recently found out I have NPD after my gf whom I love so much broke up with me. I love so much that I did not want to give up on her till one day it pushed me so hard that I managed to find out I have NPD. It is a very shocking news to me. Throughout my whole 25 years, I have always wondered why am I so bad tempered all the time, full of grudges, anger in my heart that could not go away and doing things I shouldn't be doing. And I finall 

Variety of likely reasons. The first and most obvious is one of necessity. Common knowledge they cant survive solo so one hazards a guess latest supply has had a wake up call and finally showed him the door. With no time to plan new supply in advance its out with the little black book to see who might be up for a charm offensive. Always better the devil you know when time is of the essence and they need a bit of stability for a while. Then there’s the chance your own situation has seen an uplift. For this to be of significance it has to be of considerable financial gain whether through a promot 

If you want the narcissist to value you again you have to destroy your boundaries, self-flagellate yourself by denying yourself basic respect and self-esteem. You have to create yourself to be an extension of the narcissist’s self. At the same time you have to FEIGN that you do have some level of self respect because the narcissist’s abuse will gradually become worse if you become a literal doormat. You also have to be at their beck and call and even risk possible stds (because many cheat or sleep around). So if you want to live a life of being a masochistic doormat that pretends to have some k 

What you are really asking is: “What will make my narcissistic ex start valuing me again and want me back?” In other words: “How do I get an abusive partner back in my life?” My response to that would be, why do you want to get back with an abusive partner? These could be the reasons: You haven’t found or discovered your self-worthYou have some form of co-dependencyYou willingly accept disrespectful and bad treatmentYou haven’t spoken to any close friends or a counsellor about the relationship to get supportYou don’t understand abusive cycles in narcissistic relationships, and the stages of ideal

Necessity- being thrown out by his current supply or getting into financial difficulty. But he will never value her, he will simply use her again till he gets an alternative. Never trust a narc- everything is false, and happiness will never come with a narc, only more misery, and another discard. Don´t believe me? Read and become an expert on narcissism. This is surprisingly easy, because they always act the same, all the time, and they do the same things to people over and over again. There is a narc pattern. So one good book will do it. The best book I ever found on narcissism generally is P 

What hurt you the most after the discard from your ex-narcissist?
He made me question the God given spiritual gift… my own intuition. That’s what hurts the most. I’m not above admitting that my intuition was kicking me in the back of the head from day one. He encouraged me to quit my two solid jobs and work for his company. A year and a half later he fired me and broke up with me in one day out of the blue because I stood up for myself after he went into a raging fit because he got jealous of me and some guy I didn’t even know. I was completely devoted to him. We went everywhere together. He started to try and tell me what to wear and what not to wear but I  

The pain I suffered was life threatening. Sharp pain in my sides, sleep deprivation, an unimaginable amount of depression, stress and anxiety. What hurt the most was fighting and fighting to keep and save a relationship from falling apart only to later realize the person you were trying to appease, save, and love was the one that was laughing at your efforts and working against you in every way possible. These people are passed the pinnacle of evil and they are heartless. They will leave you absolutely empty and confused. When they discard, you don't even know what your life was before you met 

The last 1.5 yrs with my ex-gf was brutal. I was subjected to most of the cruel tricks Closet/Covert Narcissists use to send the message of who holds the power and control in the relationship, and who is clearly and absolutely lesser than. The discard was particularly harsh - cold, calculating, condescending. Everything about her was different then: attitude, posture, tone of voice etc. I didn’t know about closet narcissism then. And neither did my ex-gf. We both knew something was terribly wrong. I just couldn’t figure out what that was and she, of course, said it was just me. Even with the abo 

A relationship with a narc is not a normal relationship. Normally, after a break up you miss the presence of the partner, you are not used anymore to be alone. You miss the good times, and you still care about the ex. A feeling is not something can be suddently cut.After the discard from a narc… there is just a big mess. In my case the cognitive dissonance is really strong, I can literally feel different parts of me fighting each other. There is a rational part that brings me just to the reality: my ex is mentally sick, there is nothing to do. I can consider myself lucky to have been dumped, a 

It has been 3 years for me and I have actually grown to enjoy my time with myself and do a lot of healing. I will say this however, the only thing that sometime’s gets me is that he seems so perfectly happy with the woman he left and married just weeks later for. It feels that I will never have the validation that he truly was that cruel, rageful, man that put me through so much. It is like he got away with it and lived his life in a great way and she honestly seems like a nice person. It is odd that they are living the exact life we planned. She even has 2 daughters and a son and one grandchi 

Coming to the realization that I meant nothing to him. That’s what hurt the most. It hit me like a ton of bricks. It hurt that I could be so easily cut off. Blocked. Shunned. Goodbye. Adios. No explanation. Without a second thought for me as a person. Gone. In the blink of an eye. “How could he do this? What did I do wrong? Why is he treating me this way? How can I fix this?” All of the questions I continuously kept asking myself. Driving myself crazy, hoping and praying that he would just unblock me and message me again to apologize for his actions, or even just to reconnect. I waited and waite 

The way she told me that it was all just an illusion…That it really never meant anything for her.That she “ really liked me” at one time.. To hear that just gutted me. Which, looking back on her behavior, that is exactly what she was communicating to me…Her behavior made me very uncomfortable for many months in that relationship. And I guess that the hurt was magnified ten fold by the fact that I believed it was all true and to lead me like that for so long to the point where we were making future plans and adult decisions….sacrifices were about to be made and on some levels were already made… Tha 

The nastiness after the fact that he said nobody liked me I was toxic I always fall out with people he accused me of being an alcoholic which was unbelievable! That same morning as I got out of his car I kissed him and he pulled me back in for another kiss and told me how much he loved me. This man bought my marital home so I didn’t after downsize he paid 7 grand in solicitors bills he paid me 350 pounds each week because he made me pack my job in to live with him in Marbella I know our relationship was different to anyone he had before his friends and family told me so he had never done this  

Coming to the realization that I was nothing but a pawn to him. I was expendable, my feelings and commitment meant nothing. He claims I never had any feelings and never wanted a commitment. He twisted everything I said and did into me apparently not giving a damn about him when it was him who in fact didn’t have a damn. He took up with another girl I knew, a person he tried to force me to be around, claiming she was like a little sister to him. He claimed for a year that I had destroyed him so badly he could never have a relationship again, while shacking up with that girl. I felt like I’d bee 

Realising he had never loved me, and I had wasted ten years of my life believing a con man . That hurt. But this is what every normal person walking into a narc relationship will face- that terrible realisation. And most have kids with the narc, so the narc´s toxic and unloving behaviour affects all of them. That is why I am on this site, trying to tell people that narcs don´t ever change, no matter how much you love them they will never love you back. They only love themselves, and they will drop you overnight if they get a better offer. And if they don´t they will take their anger out on you, 

Am I being gaslighted? My husband’s ex is throwing an event on my birthday, the event is for their daughter. How should I respond to the situation?
Gaslighting is when a person tries to change your reality and then when you question that reality, they make you seem crazy. It comes from a movie where a husband kept messing with the gas lighting in the house and the wife would ask “wait, are the lights different?” and he would say “no, of course not” and she went insane. He drove her insane to get her money. Gaslighting does not mean that someone is just being a jerk. It means they are literally fucking with your mind to the point that you are no longer connected to reality. Your husband’s ex throwing their daughter a party on your birthday i 

Did you ever think she doesn’t have a clue that it is your birthday? Your husband probably doesn’t remember so he hasn’t told her. Most men seem to forget things like birthdays, anniversaries, etc.. Time to bring this to hubby’s attention. You can say something like, “Did you forget that this event is being held on my birthday? Don’t say it defensively. Just bring it up in an easy voice to him. To be honest, you don’t say how old this child is, but the age shouldn’t matter. Anything that a child considers a major event should be dealt with first. There may be no choice but to hold the event on t 

Does she even know when your birthday is? What is the occasion for your daughter? BTW I don’t see where there’s any gaslighting unless your husband is trying to convince you that’s not the day of your birthday or something. I think you should respond by accepting graciously (I assume you are invited since it’s some big deal for your stepdaughter). Unless it’s a big landmark birthday, and/or you and your husband have already planned something you can’t change, be the adult and celebrate your birthday on another date. If she hasn’t invited you, discuss with your husband. Unless he’s not invited e 

What is the event? Is it something important? I'll word differently…is it something important to HER? Also, how old are you? Is it a milestone birthday? 30? 40? Because if it isn't, grow up. Adult birthdays are as important as adult Halloween. Sure, it's fun if the stars align and it happens to fall on a weekend and all of your friends are still childless and can come out at the same time, but not fuckin’ likely. Kids get to be kids for only a short period of time. You get to celebrate your birthday on whatever damn day you choose. That's the beauty of being an adult. It's not that you are being ga 

Gaslighting is manipulating someone and if you need to know what manipulation is do to you not being able to confidently say an accurate definition in your words you should let up the definition for manipulation. Your husband’s ex throwing a party for their daughter shouldn’t affect you and your husband too much because I’d like to think even though the kid is his he would put more time/effort into celebrating your birthday then the kid’s. I recommend you just tell your husband you should go spend sometime with your kid that day and then you and me can celebrate my birthday the same day. 80 views · View upvotes1Sponsored by Capital Com SV Investments LimitedAlways wanted to start trading?Sign up for the free demo account on Capital.com!

How should you respond? First of all you are thinking exactly the way you should be. Just sayin. Your response should be to speak to your husband and let him know EXACTLY how you are feeling about this. Second I would, in a very nice way, let your daughter know that she is the luckiest and will be the busiest person in the world on that day. She will have two places to celebrate and have fun. I am sure your daughter will be wondering why it is happening on your birthday. She may even ask her father while on the way to the other event.

Whatever her intentions are, just ignore her. Do not fall prey to such petty, cheap and ridiculous scheming. She and her contrivances don't exist for you. She doesn't exist as far as you are concerned. She is a nonentity. You are blissfully unaware of her existence and what she does. It doesn't exist, it doesn't cause concern in you, and it doesn't affect you. What exists for you are your husband and your family. The present. You have your life to live, and have your peace, well-being and happiness to work for. Just mind only that much. Anyone or anything beyond that is non-existence. 32 views1Alexandra Plot, B.A. and B.S in Psychology, Aviation. Doctorate DVMUpdated October 31, 2020 · Author has 5.3K answers and 1.7M answer views

That's not what Gaslighting is. Gaslighting is causing someone to question their own sanity, memory, judgment, etc. You're asking if she's doing this intentionally to hurt you? Not necessarily. She probably doesn't care enough about you or think about you enough to go to all this effort just to upset you. Also, she may have no idea that it's even your birthday. Try to avoid assuming that it is about You. You can celebrate your birthday on the exact day every other year. I doubt this type of event will be on your birthday every year.

You don’t mention what the event is, but the best thing you can do is let the daughter have her moment, and you and your husband plan a fabulous birthday celebration for you. I don’t know of the history with his ex, or what the daughter’s occasion is, but we adults can celebrate our special days whenever we like! If the ex mentions your birthday, you can confidently say that you have a wonderful event planned when it is more convenient for you as a couple. 52 views · View upvotes1Mi Hen, studied at University of South FloridaAnswered November 14, 2020 · Author has 326 answers and 536.7K answer views

How did you outfox your ex in family court?
My ex upped and walked out from our relationship, primarily due to religious family pressures from her side, taking our 15-month-old daughter with her. At first, she and her mother wouldn't let me visit, but I got a lawyer to organize makeshift visitation rights for me. My ex tried many tactics to keep me away, but I loved my daughter and had no intention of shirking my parental responsibilities, so I took it to Family Court and got full and fair visitation. My daughter visited me on two weekends after the court declaration, and then my ex and her new husband packed up and moved to Cape Town (140 

I learned through experience that documenting “stuff” can make The Difference. Now, writing down “stuff” initially was my way to ensure I wasn’t crazy or was mistaken about what occurred in the past. Memories are not always accurate. Some people might refer to documentation as a form of Journaling or Keeping a Diary, and it is, I guess. Anyway, my daughter’s Daddy refused to pay monthly child support even though he made far more money than I did. He was a tight-fisted miser when it came to me and our child. When we were together one of his favorite mantras was “Your money is my money and my mon 

Very, very important…once you seperate family court is to find the best result for the child. In this context you are the child's parents, not each others “ex”. This is not about your relationship, your anger with each other, bitterness and disappointment. No one cares about the adults, you must put the child first. To answer the question directly using the word ex. My ex did it herself, she gave the court the message, that our daughter is a fat, dirty, liar who doesn't deserve to go on holiday. My daughter (15 living with me) has been telling the court that she wants her mum to stop calling her 

I simply presented what he introduced to the court to start the case. My ex went to family court and filed a request for a domestic violence restraining order (DVRO). He had done this to leverage child custody. And although he refused to follow through with his request for a DVRO, child custody orders were affected by this. My attorney at the time changed our plan to take the domestic violence issue to trial at the last minute. What I hadn’t realized or known was that because the issue wasn’t tried, child custody orders were still going to be affected by it as if I were actually guilty of DV. M 

Hahaha I didn't have to. His stupid ass talked himself into a corner. Ok… true story… We were battling for custody after he kept calling cps on me. He gets a visit and dips to North Dakota from Texas. What do I do? Buy a car and go get my fucking kids. He calls the cops saying I kidnapped them and that I had drugs in my car. The cops hem me up for like 4 hours and tear my car apart to find these supposed drugs. Surprise!!! It’s clean and so am I. The cops call him and tell him that they don't appreciate him wasting their time and are letting me go. Fast forward. I move to Colorado to get tf away 

It really didn’t take much from me, honestly. My ex is all talk and no show, as is his entire toxic family. I was the one in the relationship who did everything. I did our taxes, filled out all the forms for school, filled out housing applications. Everything. He hated doing it and always left it all to me. So when it came to divorce, it was pretty much a cakewalk. I did everything myself with just a bit of help from a lawyer friend. I even wrote up our custody agreement, which I knew he’d never even read. For child support, I asked for very little. I didn’t want to have to deal with Friend of t

My ex shot herself in the foot with her own ignorance of the law. As a recently arrived immigrant her English was bad and she got some really bad legal advice from strangers who were her Facebook friends. She actually submitted her conversation with Facebook friends as part of the court documents! LOL.. During one our arguments she ‘secretly’ recorded it, thinking it would ‘prove’ I’m an unfit/dangerous father. This argument was about getting my son to eat his lunch and to stop spoiling him. He was yelling that he didn’t want to finish his lunch, while I told him he can’t watch TV/play with his  

My ex showed up to a custody hearing in a military dress uniform with several medals on it that I’d never seen before, presumably to impress the judge. The ex was trying to sue me for full custody of the kids, to paint me as an unfit mother (even though there was zero evidence of this, and I was the breadwinner who provided for them). Anyway, I was waiting outside the courtroom when my ex arrived into the waiting room all dressed up this way. I asked the bailiff if there was a different place I could wait, because I had a protective order (which I showed to him). He took me to an adjoining roo

She didn’t show up until the next morning which meant that my brother had to call off work.

Why do breakups happen even after being together for years?
Oh, people split up for all kinds of reasons—most of these are not the kind of answer you’re looking for tho: cheating, lying, abuse, addiction… etc. I’m guessing you want to know why two people who love each other and have an otherwise functional relationship end up going their separate ways. Let me tell you a bit about my story. Approximately one year ago I ended a long (nearly 10 year) relationship with a man I loved (and still love) deeply. We had gotten together during the endings of our respective marriages and had a two year courtship; getting to know one another and falling deeply in lo 

In a lot of cases, it’s specifically BECAUSE the people involved have been together for so many years. Almost every one of the cases I’ve seen where long-term couples break up follows the same progression of events from the moment they meet until the bitter end, and it all has to do with an increasingly intolerable familiarity with one another. I think Chris Rock put it best when he said that when you first meet someone, you’re not really meeting THEM, you’re meeting their representative. The reason for this is obvious: when you first meet someone you’re interested in, you want to impress them  

Falling in love is a mix of luck (meeting this one spiritual match that could have been a continent away but just happens to be on your bus, then having the chance to spend enough time to realize you have a connection) and something like magic (good or bad?). The process of being in love creates endorphins that quite literally drug you into loving that person more than you ever thought was possible. Even if you’re aware of the fact that you’re under the influence of one of the most powerful mind altering drugs ever known, you can’t decipher where the “real” person ends and the drug induced awe

You put in all efforts to make them happy keeping yourself secondary. At first instance you were attracted to their looks, voice, intellect, etc and did not stop to think about your compatibility with each other before pursuing a serious relationship.

What is the most savage revenge you've seen someone take on their ex?
Husband and wife married when they were in their late teens. He is smart and a looker, she is brilliant. They move from London to Hong Kong due to his job but soon she finds one that is satisfying. The workload is heavy and both travel constantly. But they are both soon on $500,000+ packages. He starts ‘playing around’ and the number of girlfriends mount (I was always surprised that he could not cut anyone off). She notes this and he is ‘reformed’ several times. After 10 or 12 years he meets and falls hard for another professional. She is smart and a looker but not brilliant. She is not willing

He yelled out “everyone put your money away, I’m shouting the bar for the rest of the night!”We wondered if he was quite sane, but he insisted he knew what he was doing, and asked that the barman bring out every bottle of black sambuca in the storeroom, as  

Thanks for the ask, Sean Kernan. I’ve witnessed some savage revenge when couples decouple. High school. There was the lass who discovered her boyfriend wasn’t always playing Warhammer 40k when he said he was, so on a weekend when he was supposedly playing it at a friend’s house she went to his house and gave the mini-figures an acetone bath. Dissolved all of them. There was the lad who discovered his girlfriend wasn’t entirely faithful about a week before her 18th birthday. She had a charm bracelet, the ones you put little pendants. He got her a 24 carat gold charm for her birthday and handed it o 

I have seen a lot in my years (probably too much) and this story was quite unusual even for me. This is a long story so bear with me. My husband worked with a man, let's call him Cliff, and over time they became good friends. He was a very nice man, in his late 30′s and looking at him you’d have guessed he may have been handsome once. He had very blonde hair which was scattered with gray, beautiful blue eyes and a nice build. One of those builds you get from working hard outside, not the gym. He looked much older than his years. He’d had a very hard life and it showed in his face. Cliff joined a 

I started dating this girl, 30, I am 30 too. It was cool, when we met, she told me she broke up with her bf a couple of months ago. I started inviting her to dinners, we started hanging out casually. Then things developed fast, and we became bf and gf. For 2 months, things were amazing, she told me she loved me so much, and she thinks about me all the time, I felt the same! I told her from the beginning, I was looking for a long lasting relationship that would lead to marriage. Then all in a sudden, she started flaking on our dates, not answering my texts or phone calls. I thought she might be 

This is a slightly different tale. I used to do the administration for a number of company pension schemes. The companies themselves deal with the members and I dealt with the companies. One particular company was very supportive of its workers and knew their family backgrounds well. One middle aged gentleman, I shall call George, had never had a relationship and lived alone but was always kind and generous to family and friends. He met a woman, I shall call Lucy, with 3 young children who had been made homeless by her ex husband. He immediately offered a roof over their heads because of the chi 

I don’t know that this was “savage” but it was entertaining. I had gotten married very young and my husband at the time was a horrible liar and cheat. We were renting a house on the same block as my parents and one day he had come home from “work” early and shortly after the phone went on the fritz. This was before cell phones. I needed to make a call so I went up the street to my parents’ house. About 5 minutes after I got there, a female called and asked for me. She explained that she was my husband’s fiancée and wanted to talk with me about why I was making our “divorce” so difficult and re 

Is it true that my narcissistic ex won, since he seems very happy with his new supply that he cheated me for?
Has an ex from years ago ever contacted you 'out of the blue'? What did they want?
It wasn’t years ago at the time. Her name wasn’t Jessica, but it will do for here. I met Jessica online because I’ve always been socially awkward, and have a hard time meeting people randomly in real life settings. We had great conversations online, and texted frequently, and when I first met her in person she did something odd to me that instantly put me at ease. I’ve always been hesitant about being aggressive, so I tend to keep a respectful gap between me and anyone who might be uncomfortable. She walked right up to me and invaded my personal space, nearly chest bumping me, which told me sh 

Oh my god yes and it was so funny when he did (not a haha funny but a wtf you're crazy funny) I dated this guy in my senior year of highschool.. I was 19 and he was 21 and already out of highschool obviously (I was expelled from school in 9th grade and had failed 3rd grade hence why I was 19 and still in highschool- my home life wasn't easy so at the time school was the least of my concerns). We dated for about half a year. 2 months in I was at his house hanging out with him and his parents then randomly their doorbell rang… his mom answered it and then she came back into the living room holdin 

Several years ago I happened to find a Facebook message from an old boyfriend, a boyfriend I hadn't seen or heard from for 16 years. I didn't see the message for almost 9 months after it was sent because it was in a “spam” or “other" folder. He had written some nonsense about how he “just happened” to be watching some videos and -- whoa! -- saw my very familiar face! (I had in fact acted in a promotional product video for a foreign inventor who was in my country for a trade show at the time, but the product video was so niche that there was no way this ex happened to be browsing these videos,  

Yes… It’s happened to me several times over the years. One very recently. Each time was a bit different but basically the same theme. EX SAYS: “I’m sorry for how I was and if I hurt you blah blah blah,” Then the real reason makes itself clear. EX IS REALLY SAYING : “ I got my heart broken by somebody else and you were always there for me and would have never treated me this way. And now I need to talk to someone who will boost my ego and put me back together so I can face the world again” I often obliged them with what they wanted or the moral support they needed. But I have only taken one EX back i 

It’s strange how the universe works sometimes. My wife left me in 2009, 6 months later I met someone else, she was the funniest person I’ve ever met, she was gorgeous and imperfectly perfect, I fell for her really really hard. The problem was I was still living in the same house as my wife as she was flip flopping about moving out, I suppose if anything we were on and off at this point, I told her I’ve met some else, she hit the roof and low and behold she wanted me back! Threatened to kill her self if I left her. I took her back, purely because for the 1st time in a year I could she she actual 

Warning-Horror Story ahead. I’m m a man and not long ago had an ex-girlfriend contact me about 10 times using fake accounts on either Facebook and or Instagram. These messages were always the same and were threatening my career and my personal safety. I decided to ignore everything and take the higher road. I always knew it was her but of course could never prove it. Did I mention I’m in my 40’s? And so is she… Anyway, I ignored her for years and got myself into another relationship and moved on. The straw that broke the camels back is she decided to contact my mother. My mother kept this from me 

Yes. Pretty much shoking and unusual. My ex boyfriend contacted me via LinkedIn in the begining of 2019, and I haven't seen him since 2004. We live in the same city, about 600.000 inhabitants total, including the perifery zone villages. He was my only ex boyfriend. Our relationship was meant to be because his origins are partially similar with mine. But actually we were everything but a normal couple. We never lived together or engaged. We were always like ‘will and grace’. Some of his friends would always be there. We tried and it didn't work out. So we didn't give much sacrifice to make it h 

Not really an ex but an old best friend I was in love with at 19. He was so sweet and we were just too young and immature - and just drunk every weekend together! I made it clear for years how much I wanted him in my life and was ignored constantly and let down. I heard through Facebook about things that had happened - he had been in the Army, discharged due to an incident then lost his fiancé (who I used to go out on nights out with) in a car accident! I never contacted him as I had been made to stay out of his life by my current partner for at least 5 years so it seemed inappropriate! 12 years l 

This wasn’t exactly an ex but rather someone that expressed they had feelings for me way back in middle school. I am now moved in with my boyfriend that I am planning to marry. We are super tight and ever since a year ago I post him occasionally and people see it, including my exes. We both are from the same city (where we also met) and together moved out of the state. I got a new phone in the process and only gave the number out to my closest friends and family. One day while I was in the car with my boo I receive a strange text from a phone that had my old home’s area code: “Hey [my name].” Me: 

Yes. I didn't even know or recognize the number. I answered and said “Hello". There was one word “John?” followed by a long pause. I was trying to place the voice. It was familiar. I answered yes and then a few questions followed. Are you happy? Do you know who this is? Is it ok if I call you? Still trying to place the voice when it hit me who it was. I told her to slow down then asked what was wrong. She told me she had made a terrible mistake and proceeded to explain a lot of things that happened in the past. I listened and her conversation brought a lot of things back from memory. The infor 

How do you really hurt an ex-narcissist?
Dear Vanessa. I have covered this many times in other posts. But because you are such a delicate petal, an exquisite specimen of womanhood, I will repeat it once again just for you.  Despite their tough guy facade, narcissists have a particular weakness. And this weakness is Social exclusion. Ostracism. Banishment. Narcissists’ social pain seen only in the brain It seems ridiculous. It is. They are ridiculous people. Throwing stones from their glass houses. You can smash them without breaking a sweat, if you so choose. The only reason you haven't is because you thought they loved you. They can't, a 

You walk away, and stay no contact. You block the narc, and you disappear. Simple, no drama. The narc will be confused, then annoyed. You will never really hurt them, because they never loved you, and they will simply move on to your replacement, but this is as close as you will ever get. This is not what the narc script says will happen, so the narc will not get it at all, and will blame you, then smear you, but they were going to do that anyway, so you are no worse off. Narcs want relationships to end badly, with lots of drama and wailing and fights over dvds and begging. Deprive them of tha 

You don’t. You move on. You don’t need to waste any more of your time thinking about the narcissist, even if it is thinking about revenge. And, if you are still thinking about it, you are likely not over them, have not yet healed, and therefore still under their control. Besides, no matter what actions you take, you can’t really hurt someone that cannot believe they are not perfect and infallible. What causes the most emotional injury to a narcissist is taking absolutely no action at all. Nothing gets to a narcissist like cutting them off completely and permanently. It says to them that they ar 

i can only answer this now because he told me what hurts him, and i believe hurt is the wrong word. i believe the question should be more of “ how do you instill anxiety in a narcissist” because i dont think hurt is something we can cause. anger, rage and disgust, hate yes… hurt no. ( IMO) how do you instill anxiety ? NC. he just told me this yesterday “ when you get angry at me and i go 3 weeks without hearing from you, i cant function at work” now, mind you… its not because he misses me, because when we are in contact, he does NOT request a night to hang out, a movie, or just my company. he can  

A difficulty many people have in regards to narcissists (someone with npd) is to consider them as if they were like a normal person, only evil or selfish or bad, as opposed to being handicapped, for example. To give an analogy, consider a blind person and a deaf person. No one would consider a blind person to be stupid because they had some difficulty because of their blindness. They would just think,”That person’s blind.” Deaf peopl on the other hand are often misperceived as being mentally challenged because their handicap isn’t perceived. A person sees they have difficulty speaking, and can r 

After studying a little about this subject I have read time and time again that this is not a good idea. If you want a fight that you’ll never win, go ahead and try but it seems that in most cases, purposely trying to hurt a pwNPD is to engage in a childish game of tit for tat that will just get worse. The problem lies in the childish nature of their emotions. Imagine two little kids fighting over a favourite toy. Each kid has hold of it. They’re both pulling it away from the other, screaming at each other, trying to win. There is no giving in from either side. It will not be resolved until a  

Hurt a narcissist? Why do you think they behave the way they do? The narcissist act the way he does to protect his self-image. When you hurt a narcissist you are only making his need for this destructive mechanism bigger and bigger. He is getting confirmed that no one loves him for being him so he need to create this bigger mechanism to prevent this from happening again. This new mechanism is driving people crazy, he’s getting hurt again and so on… So when hurting the narcissist you are actually creating a worse one for the next victim. Kill them with kindness. Show vulnerability to them because 

Take them by the bare arm with both of your hands, then rapidly twist their skin in opposing directions. This will really hurt them for 5–15 seconds, and you'll feel much better about yourself, and be able to hold your chin even higher than you've previously thought was possible. Now grab a pair of scissors and a your favorite lip stick and head to a mirror. Look at that mirror and tell yourself how pretty you are, and that your brain is so powerful. Now, get your phone out and start your Facebook Live feed, and show everyone how good you are at putting on shitty makeup. Take that lip stick and 

You don’t! Your anger turns into their ammunition. Every lie they ever told you, every time they cheated, every time they abused you, every fucking time you reacted, IS YOUR FAULT! They blame YOU! The quicker you understand that, is the quicker you end the trauma bond! These soul sucking, heartless fucks have all kinds of weak, clueless, caring souls just like us in line. Pathetic, I know. The plan is not to hurt them, but to be the BEST GOD DAMN PERSON YOU CAN BE! Learn from this mistake. They will NEVER get better! No matter what they say, what image they portray on social media, it’s all FAKE! We  

The worst thing you can do to a narcissist is treat it as if no longer exists. Apathy to a narc is like throwing holy water on to a vampire. It’s why the NO CONTACT RULE was created. If you’re looking to “hurt” as in punish your narc, you’re barking up the wrong tree. These toxic human impostors exist to cause rife and chaos to their victims. By engaging with them at all, either in positive or negative behavior, you’re essentially feeding their bloviated egos by confirming they are still in control over you. Make sense now about the no contact rule?

Has a young child ever come up to you alone and asked for help? How did you react, and what did you do?
What made you forbid someone from ever entering your home again?
What made you forbid someone from ever entering your home again? It was many years ago. I had a friend who I now realize was either borderline or narcissistic (to the level of a disorder). But back then, in the early 1980s, I just tried to cope with her weirdly manipulative behaviors. Finally, I had to put a boundary in place when she tried to rope me into coming along and sneaking into the home of a guy she’d been dating. She was planning to soak all of his valuable inherited silver pieces in an extremely strong salt solution to force him to have her over to help him clean and restore it—!? Thi 

I have a friend, I’ve mentioned her before as my promiscuous friend. I’m not judging anyone who decides to choose that path, but the way this girl has demonstrated herself was less than desirable in this household. The first big thing about her was in the summer between our 7th and 8th grade year, my family invited her along with us on a trip. She was very much grateful for this since she never left our home state much. We were preparing for this for months. The night before we left, she was texting a few guys back and forth and they were asking for nudes. Only reason she didn’t send any back w 

I am clean and sober over 42+ years. Despite an upper middle class background and the best of schools, I decided to forego pursuing advanced education and degrees and instead learned most of my knowledge, by trial and errors on the streets of New Orleans and New York City with a bottle in my hand and pills in my pocket. Many times it was society’s lowest of the low, the homeless bums, prostitutes, junkies, and, winos that were my teachers and mentors. They taught me survival tricks, street smarts, and how to stay clear of the 3rd rail. I loved those dear folks. When I hit a very low bottom and  

My eldest is nearly 19 and autistic. He's not very experienced at relationships. He brought his first girlfriend home at 17 and she seemed like a nice girl. She lived an hour away and he doesn't drive so I would pick her up and bring her to our house for the weekend. Everything seemed great. However I started to have misgivings about the relationship. There were lots of red flags. Including the fact that he told me when he stayed at hers because she liked to drink (perfectly legal in your own home at 16 in the UK) and he has always been anti drinking (even now he's never even sipped alcohol an 

-PROLOGUE- So many answers already and oh boy.. This question seems made for me. Technically I could say there is two or so times I banned someone from my house — one was a cleaning service —but I'll go with the one, the person, that was most emotionally draining. Warning: it is super long. It's unfortunate my last name is tied to this, I do hope there is not any backlash on my family or the community I live in. But I'm not about to go anonymous on this. I have no reason to. If anything it might make people more aware. Before I've written briefly about having a family member addicted to drugs. Th 

Let’s go back to 2009, when I was still in high school. I will repost a story I did on Reddit a while back. All names will be changed for the purpose of this answer. Before I begin, I just want to give you a short answer and say that I banned my ex friend from my household right after these events took place. She basically betrayed my trust and stole from me blatently. Also for the disgusting bullying she did afterwards. Anyway, this ex friend in high school was in foster care. We'll call her 'Bonnie.' Thing is, in the beginning when we started getting to know each other, 'Bonnie' was only just p 

My best friend I've known since I was 5. She's currently homeless, pregnant, has a one year old and 9 year old twins. Finding out she was recently made homeless, I decided to let her stay until she could get a job, find a place, etc. Lasted only 5 days, until my first night off (I work nights, so I usually sleep all day and pretty much just lock myself in my room) and about midnight I realize my cigarettes are missing. I lose stuff a lot, so I wasn't too worried but I wandered around the house looking for them. After the first 15 minutes of not finding them I started really digging because even 

It was a summer morning, some holiday (possibly July 4th?). My parents were over visiting, we had a reasonable number of beers and were discussing politics. The neighbor showed up (out of the black of night) and asked if he could join. No problem - we pour him one and ask him what he thinks of Erdogan (the Turkish president; it was right after he allowed a coup in his country, suppressed it within hours then put every bit of resistance down to school teachers in prison). The neighbor says something indistinct - not just ‘not into politics’ but also fairly drunk. Oookay, it’s a holiday, as long 

The only person who I have banned from my home is a friend of my partners (I am a 37F, and he is a 35M. The friend is a 28F). We live in a very small studio apartment (20 square m) and she has been to our place before. It s a long read, but TLDR at the end. We have been together for four years and in that time, she is the only person who I have not taken to from his friends and family. When I first met her, she was polite but seemed a little upset or sad about something, the second time, she didn’t contribute to the conversation and was a mute the whole evening. I noticed, that my partner only  

I genuinely liked my son’s best friend, Ben. For a seven-teen year old he was remarkably eager to please and warm hearted. I secretly hoped one of those qualities would rub off on my somewhat apathetic son. When I overheard Ben telling my son he was looking for a summer job I knew that I’d found my guy. I offered him $500 a week to clear out the brush and brambles in the overgrown pasture at the edge of our property. He agreed on the spot, smiling so wide during dinner that peas kept falling out of his mouth. Ben started a week later. He worked five hours a day, often in the hot sun, without com

In Israel, there was a pretty young bride with thick dark hair, a contagious laugh and a bubbly personality. We’ll call her Malka (a common Hebrew name, it means ‘queen’). Three months ago she became engaged to a handsome, earnest and smiling Yeshiva student who we’ll call Yonatan (Jonathan). They were introduced by Malka’s cousin who studied in Yeshiva (Jewish college of Torah study) together with Yonatan. They were friends - for years they used to hang out together, sometimes studying Torah and sometimes just chilling with some good Israeli music and some good Israeli beer. He knew well from  

I went to a destination wedding 12 years ago in the Caribbean as part of a short vacation trip that I took. I didn't know anyone but my traveling companion and her daughter; the rest of the wedding party were strangers to me. The bride looked beautiful, the weather was great, and everybody got along. It was actually one of the best weddings that I had ever attended and I was happy that I was allowed to be a part of it. After the ceremony at the wedding dinner, the bride announced that she was expecting and that brought applause and cheers from everyone except one person. What I didn't know (and  

Many years ago when I first started dating my husband his older brother was dating a girl that I just wanted to distance myself from. Now many people will understand when I say that his older brother is the first born, male, and the family was Italian and German, so he could do no wrong. He’s a great guy and I love him, but I sometimes get weary of his elevated status no matter what. Ok back to the chick; my husband’s father must have had a little crush on her too because by association she could do no wrong either even though she was pretentious, insulting and thought she was the smartest pers 

You will have to decide who was the rudest person at the wedding I am going to describe. A few years ago I worked with a young lady who was rather shy. She was one of these people that always wanted to please everyone, and got upset easy. I liked her a lot but felt like saying, calm down! Anyway I was invited to her wedding. I hadn’t been to that church, but I had heard that the Pastor liked to hear himself talk. I didn’t know what to make of that statement, but I sure found out! The service started out nice, it wasn’t a very big wedding, maybe 50 people. About half way through the service befor 

Going anonymous, so as not to embarrass a couple of the characters who are still living. My dad remarried in 2000, and he wanted to have a big, fancy reception for family and friends. It was held at a very nice location downtown. Drinks were readily available to those who might have wanted to imbibe, and at events like this of course there's always someone who does…. My dad had invited a neighbor-lady from across the street to come, but instead her 40-something son, whom we'll call “John”, and his date showed up. I recall him arriving with a big smile on his face. In no time, he was tossing down 

In the late 70s, I was invited to a what turned out to be a fairly fancy and expensive wedding reception. The lady (let’s call her J.) and I were early into our relationship, so I was aware that I wouldn’t know too many of the other guests. That would be a bit of a problem because J. was a member of the wedding party, and we would not be spending much of the evening together, not even at the same table for dinner. The Bride’s parents had really laid it on for their only daughter - the City’s finest Hotel Ballroom, tons of guests, excellent dinner, et cetera. All the guests were dressed up - the 

I was the maid of honor at my college friend's wedding. Everything went beautifully except for one moment during the reception. One of the first dances was supposed to be just for the wedding party; the groom with the bride, both sets of parents with each other, and all the attendants with their opposite-sex counterparts. While the dance was being announced, the best man - the groom's younger brother - slipped out and nobody could find him. He had ducked out of his own brother's reception just to avoid dancing one dance with me. I had only met him the day before, and we had barely exchanged a  

Didn’t (thank God) happen at any wedding I have been to, but I recall reading this one in the newspaper years ago when they published a collection of readers’ worst-thing-that-happened-at-my-wedding stories: Hands-down winner for me was one woman recounting her husband’s best man and (I guess) a close bud of the best man who was an usher as well. The two of them showed up to the ceremony already pretty drunk … it was all they could do to get these guys through it without too much disruption. Then came the pictures at some nearby park. Apparently they had brought along some flasks and renewed the 

Well, how about a string of things. I had major surgery 6 weeks before my daughters wedding. I spent my Six week recovery making the wedding and bridal party dresses and the last few days cooking for 200. My Dr. was pretty upset as I needed a second surgery. I had been in a roller coaster accident and he said that a sharp jar to my neck could sever my spinal cord. However, the wedding won. He gave me some heavy duty pain killers in case I needed them at the wedding. I had 6 oxycontin pills. I put them in my glove box just in case. I don’t take pain killers. I had a sister who was addicted to the 

I work as a wedding videographer so I’ve seen my fair share of obnoxious moments…but by far the most memorable one I’ve seen and heard was at a destination wedding I attended as a guest. The ceremony was perfect, the bride looked radiant—everything went without a hitch. During toasts, when it came to the bride’s older sister’s turn, she had a bunch of people roll up a projector screen in the middle of the ballroom. She started kicking up a fuss about why it was taking so long to set the whole thing up because the event planners were having a hard time connecting her laptop and project a powerpo 

Doctors: When you notice something in public such as a person with a suspicious mole, abnormal gait, or wet cough, do you ever approach them and suggest they have the issue checked out? If so, do you say you are a doctor?
I’m a failed medic. I trained in surgery and then went down the academic route and became a research fellow. Then went onto tutoring, teaching and examining. I have had a few civilian medical events which need a lot to pull me into as I am a very private person and don’t like the attention of getting involved. One was a guy in a hotel in Wales. A bunch of us stayed there as part of a huge consulting gig. This guy was also there as part of the ex-pat community. He had this really hacking cough every night. One evening in the bar he was almost coughing his guts up and I turned round, “You need to 

Most people do not like unsolicited advice, even from a doctor. I try to keep that in mind, but sometimes I still have to say or do something. My family was at lunch and I heard her before I saw her. Across the room, I was struck the unmistakeable “seal bark” cough associated with croup. The first cough stopped me mid-bite and I listened for strider. Of course, I heard nothing. A few minutes later the coughing started again. I looked around to locate the source and saw a young girl, sitting at a table seemingly in no distress. I continued my lunch but my wife could tell I was distracted. The fr 

I practice in a rural small town. While in the grocery store I saw a man with a dark spot on his arm that was very concerning for Melanoma (which is one of the diseases I consider my area of expertise). After much internal debate I approached him and quickly introduced myself, explained my concerns, and recommended that he make an appointment with his physician. It was a very brief encounter, but I did occasionally wonder (usually when I was grocery shopping) if he ever followed my advice. Several months later, a surgeon, who is a colleague and a good friend, called me to say that he was seeing 

Doctors: When you notice something in public such as a person with a suspicious mole, abnormal gait, or wet cough, do you ever approach them and suggest they have the issue checked out? If so, do you say you are a doctor? I’m not a doctor. However, several years ago I was having lunch with my adult daughter at the university cafeteria. One of the big-wig administrators was in line with us, and he appeared relatively normal. But he wasn’t. Both of us, my daughter and I, sensed something was very wrong. We didn’t know what, but “wrong” was both our feelings. I didn’t know him other than he was one 

As a rule, no. It’s quite safe to assume people don’t want to discuss their ailments in front of other people. A busy commuter train car is not the place people want to receive diagnoses. It’s also quite probable they have a doctor they see for their ailments and these things we observe might well be under management already. It would be quite intrusive to impose a conversation on personal health on a person who didn’t request it. I have thought about this upon spotting a basal cell carcinoma whilst standing in traffic lights. The lights changed and I didn’t give the person chase to draw their a 

I'm not medically trained. My parents were both nurses so theres bits I've picked up from them, and I've studied anatomy and physiology for aromatherapy massage. There are 2 incidents that's come to mind. I was chatting to my neighbor when I noticed an unusually coloured mole (purplish red) , curious I asked about it, she said she'd had it for a while but thought it was healing because it was changing colour. I asked if she'd spoken to her doctor, which she hadn't, saying she didn't have time for something so trivial (carer for disabled son). I insisted she to do so, while I thought maybe skin  

I can't count the times that this happens to me. I'm pretty young, and have been using mobility aids for the last 6years. I know people are well meaning, but unless you're my personal slew of doctors, you have absolutely no business to point out people's bodies and your idea of their health. Most doctors are not particularly versed in my genetic disorder- that's not a judgement, why would you unless you specialized? I have an info pack and letters from my primary care that I send ahead of whatever new visits I have. The amount of assumptions and confrontation I've gotten just riding the bus or 

Yes, I’ve done a successful Heimlich maneuver at a restaurant when I was a medical student. I’ve also done CPR on an elderly woman who collapsed without pulse at the boarding gate in Boston’s Logan Airport. She revived and was angry because we prevented her from getting on her flight, but her daughter thanked me profusely. More than once, I’ve introduced myself and brought attention to an enlarged thyroid gland only to be told with a smile, that they were aware and had tests showing benign goiter or thyroiditis.

I noticed straight away a member of the security staff on the door had features of acromegaly(a bit like gigantism for the lay man)-large jaw, enormous hands etc-he was straight out of the textbook, but i wasn’t gonna say anyhing, until the pints kicked in of course. After a few drinks i was having a cigarette outside and got to chatting to him-i politely although probably drunkenly asked him if he’d noticed any changes in the last year, for example had he started biting his tongue accidentally; it was hardly a subtle approach, but  

I was at the supermarket recently and the checkout lady had an obvious (to me) early shingles outbreak affecting here face and eye. Initially I was concerned about her being infectious and interacting with the public when she should have been at home, so I made a passing comment about what medical advice she had been given for her shingles. She told me her doctor said it was eczema and she had been given a cream. Then my concern was that she had an ocular emergency that was not being attended to adequately so I just said to her “you have shingles in your eye that is very serious and you should 

What is the best case of “You just picked a fight with the wrong person” that you've witnessed?
Back in 2011, I was in China. On this particular night I was having drinks at a club. This was more of a high end private setting. I was with a couple guys, talking business, closing some deals. Most the clientele there that night was locals; rich business kids, business ‘wall street’ type, government officials, etc. Place was pretty packed, there was only one other group of 4 or 5 foreigners (to China); either investors or buyers from the US that was seated along one of the bars (behind me), where as we were at one of the raised tables like 10 feet away. As the night went on, they were drinking  

The “wrong person” the fight was picked with was me. The ‘fight’ was the result of many years of fairly intense bullying, from primary school well into the third year of high school, and it was only due to the martial arts I had begun to study largely as a result of the bullying itself that enabled me to be the “wrong person” for the bully or anyone like her to pick on for a fight. At primary school, when I was about 9 or 10 years of age, I was fairly close friends with another girl, named Helen, who would join me at recess and lunch breaks to discuss books we were reading, show each other our i 

My work friend was breaking up with her husband. They had booked a holiday to Spain. She asked me did I want to step in. As my boyfriend was a builder summer holidays were impossible as he did most of his work then. He would ski in Bulgaria in January. I don't ski. So off we went. Within the first few days Spanish lads had come to our neighbouring hotel and were fighting the British ones. The police arrived, someone had got thrown off one of the lower balconies and ended up in hospital. A few days later we were in a beer garden a crowd of British lads came in, started drinking heavily, singing r 

I'm sure I've shared this before, but it fits so perfectly here. As twenty-year-old students my best friend and I were thrashers (fans of thrash metal): army boots, skin tight jeans, band T-shirts, biker jackets, lots of hair and earrings, the full shizzle. Being a “sweaty heavy" was, apparently, an invitation for the “trendies" (The guys in the £100 designer shirts with wide-awake haircuts) to abuse you verbally and physically. A year or so earlier, my jaw was broken in an unprovoked beating by four guys who drove past me and thought it would be fun to turn round and come back to kick the cra 

While there were a few times I've seen some moron pick a fight with the wrong person and got hurt, the first one that comes to mind is quite mild. Not only was the attacker surprised by what happened, so was I. My surprise was a pleasant one, his not. Back in sophomore year at Stuck-up Prep School there was this girl (I’ll call her Sally) who skipped eighth grade and joined my freshman class. She was small and would have been considered the same even around those her own age. Having attended for three years (two with our grade) nobody really knew her very well. Extremely studious, but quiet and 

I live in Thailand, which has a port of call, Pattaya, for foreign Navy ships and tourists. Nightlife is a big draw, with beer and karaoke bars, shows, foods and goods of all types and a thriving ‘entertainment’ business. Watching visitors who are from all over the world is better than TV and other social media! The city is well-prepared when Navy ships come in, with its police force working together with a group of foreign volunteers and ships’ military police (MPs). I was people-watching from an open-air restaurant and bar on Pattaya’s famous Walking Street when I saw 3 young, large and tall for 

In 2012, a Canadian conservative senator challenged future Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to a celebrity boxing match. At the time, Trudeau was a junior member of parliament and member of the Liberal party who was really only famous for being the son of the iconic and controversial Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada’s former Prime Ministers. Brazeau, a drug-using, wife-beating strip-club owner, was appointed to the senate by then-Prime Minister Steven Harper, probably on account of being the only person with aboriginal ancestry Harper actually knew. Anyway Senator Brazeau probably thought it would be 

Not a physical altercation; rather a verbal one. Norm S. was the Program Director at the radio station where I worked. He was an egotistical, know-it-all who used his status as PD to basically intimidate other staff. And this probably was owed to the fact that he was short. Really short. His bravado was the offset. Everyone knew it, but for the sake of peace avoided confrontation with this “little Napoleon.” Among Norm’s peeves was women who did not “know their place.” Peggy D. was an elegant woman, who hosted our classical music segment. She was polite, if a bit remote, socially, and spoke in p 

I went to a private boys school in Sydney and I was a boarder with lots of overseas students and Aussies from rural areas who never seen or interacted with Asian people. In my particular boarding house, a lot of overseas students had to endure getting bullied and being called, “gook”, “fucking Asian”, “dirty Asian”, etc by them country boys. Some of them even boasted that one of them can win a fight with 10 Asian people. One boy, his name is Andrew who was a known bully among overseas students made a mistake by bullying a student from Indonesia who had ties with Asian gang in Sydney. Andrew even 

I can give you an example that happened to me. I am very tall and slim. I am a computer programmer and probably look the part. A big goofy looking nerd. I also happen to have been practicing Martial arts for 30 years and am a certified Choy Lee Fut master. I have friends who do BJJ so I have cross trained to an extent and am also familiar with Muay Thai and Muay Boran. One day I was talking to a young kid about Thailand and Muay Thai and how they train out there. I was saying that if Kung Fu guys trained like that we’d keep mouths shut about it. Anyway some bro comes up… “What are you guys talki 

Doctors: When you notice something in public such as a person with a suspicious mole, abnormal gait, or wet cough, do you ever approach them and suggest they have the issue checked out? If so, do you say you are a doctor?
I’m a failed medic. I trained in surgery and then went down the academic route and became a research fellow. Then went onto tutoring, teaching and examining. I have had a few civilian medical events which need a lot to pull me into as I am a very private person and don’t like the attention of getting involved. One was a guy in a hotel in Wales. A bunch of us stayed there as part of a huge consulting gig. This guy was also there as part of the ex-pat community. He had this really hacking cough every night. One evening in the bar he was almost coughing his guts up and I turned round, “You need to 

Most people do not like unsolicited advice, even from a doctor. I try to keep that in mind, but sometimes I still have to say or do something. My family was at lunch and I heard her before I saw her. Across the room, I was struck the unmistakeable “seal bark” cough associated with croup. The first cough stopped me mid-bite and I listened for strider. Of course, I heard nothing. A few minutes later the coughing started again. I looked around to locate the source and saw a young girl, sitting at a table seemingly in no distress. I continued my lunch but my wife could tell I was distracted. The fr 

I practice in a rural small town. While in the grocery store I saw a man with a dark spot on his arm that was very concerning for Melanoma (which is one of the diseases I consider my area of expertise). After much internal debate I approached him and quickly introduced myself, explained my concerns, and recommended that he make an appointment with his physician. It was a very brief encounter, but I did occasionally wonder (usually when I was grocery shopping) if he ever followed my advice. Several months later, a surgeon, who is a colleague and a good friend, called me to say that he was seeing 

Doctors: When you notice something in public such as a person with a suspicious mole, abnormal gait, or wet cough, do you ever approach them and suggest they have the issue checked out? If so, do you say you are a doctor? I’m not a doctor. However, several years ago I was having lunch with my adult daughter at the university cafeteria. One of the big-wig administrators was in line with us, and he appeared relatively normal. But he wasn’t. Both of us, my daughter and I, sensed something was very wrong. We didn’t know what, but “wrong” was both our feelings. I didn’t know him other than he was one 

As a rule, no. It’s quite safe to assume people don’t want to discuss their ailments in front of other people. A busy commuter train car is not the place people want to receive diagnoses. It’s also quite probable they have a doctor they see for their ailments and these things we observe might well be under management already. It would be quite intrusive to impose a conversation on personal health on a person who didn’t request it. I have thought about this upon spotting a basal cell carcinoma whilst standing in traffic lights. The lights changed and I didn’t give the person chase to draw their a 

I'm not medically trained. My parents were both nurses so theres bits I've picked up from them, and I've studied anatomy and physiology for aromatherapy massage. There are 2 incidents that's come to mind. I was chatting to my neighbor when I noticed an unusually coloured mole (purplish red) , curious I asked about it, she said she'd had it for a while but thought it was healing because it was changing colour. I asked if she'd spoken to her doctor, which she hadn't, saying she didn't have time for something so trivial (carer for disabled son). I insisted she to do so, while I thought maybe skin  

I can't count the times that this happens to me. I'm pretty young, and have been using mobility aids for the last 6years. I know people are well meaning, but unless you're my personal slew of doctors, you have absolutely no business to point out people's bodies and your idea of their health. Most doctors are not particularly versed in my genetic disorder- that's not a judgement, why would you unless you specialized? I have an info pack and letters from my primary care that I send ahead of whatever new visits I have. The amount of assumptions and confrontation I've gotten just riding the bus or 

Yes, I’ve done a successful Heimlich maneuver at a restaurant when I was a medical student. I’ve also done CPR on an elderly woman who collapsed without pulse at the boarding gate in Boston’s Logan Airport. She revived and was angry because we prevented her from getting on her flight, but her daughter thanked me profusely. More than once, I’ve introduced myself and brought attention to an enlarged thyroid gland only to be told with a smile, that they were aware and had tests showing benign goiter or thyroiditis.

Have you ever accidentally seen your mother-in-law doing something she thought was private?
Quite a few years ago, my in-laws took their three sons and their families on a cruise to celebrate a milestone anniversary. I went with my mother-in-law to the bathroom after we had finished eating dinner. There were several stalls and there was a staff person in there as well. I don’t remember why she was there – maybe she was handing out paper towels. My mother-in-law went into the handicapped bathroom. I finished washing my hands so I was waiting for her just outside her stall. All of a sudden, this staff person accidentally leaned on the handicap button on the wall which opened the door -  

Lol! So many times. They were funny episodes. By nature iam very quiet and can sink into the corner of any room cuddling pillows and blankets. Technically I can blend into the decor without being noticed. This was 10 years ago when I was in my room and used to practice yoga and reiki studiously every day …. My mom in law wanted to try it and for 3 consecutive days she took reiki from me at night and slept soundly through the night without her insomnia pills. On the 4 th day she told me not to do any more reiki and she would manage. Evening as I was sitting in the room in one corner of the bed  

Last month, I got a surprise from my mother-in-law, what I was seeking over the years. In Feb, my mother-in-law came to visit us. She wanted a change of place and to see her son after a long time. One night, I woke up around 2 am to get a glass of water. My mother-in-law was walking in the living room. I got scared for a moment that why she is here at midnight. I asked about her health, she said, ‘She had light chest pain and feeling suffocated.’ Something wasn't good; I immediately called an ambulance. After hospitalization, the doctor said, she got a minor heart attack, and luckily, we admitted  

At first, yes. And my ex Mother-in-Law actually. I was 17 when I moved in with my ex-wife and her family. I was working a lot of midnight shifts at the time and would get home just around the time she was getting ready for work. The in laws bedroom was off of the living room and depending on where you sat and if the door was open, you could see certain parts of the bedroom. Well, I sat in the recliner usually having breakfast when I got home and several times, I saw her in various states of undress. I think eventually she realized I sat there so I could see her because I started to see more an 

My ex wife and I were on holiday with my then in laws, we were staying in a rented house,I went to the bathroom one morning passing the bedroom my in laws were using, the door was open so I decided to shut it for them, but before I did i checked to see no one was in the room. laying on the bed on a towel was my MIL and she had her legs apart as she was removing the hair from her pussy (back then I didnt think women her age did that) as i watched form behind the door she finished shaving it and began to play with herself this had my cock stiff in no time &amp; I began to masturbate coming at the sa 

I didn’t actually see her steal out of my purse but when my money was missing, it could have only been her. I was pregnant with my first child and I was taking her to run errands, (since she didn’t drive anymore; not because she was too old but just stopped, she liked being dependent) a little shopping, and then out to lunch. We ate at Panera. When the pager went off, I got up and retrieved our food. That’s when she did it. At our last stop, I went to pay for a clothing item and my $100 was missing. I was hormonal and perplexed. I started crying on the way home because it was the only cash I m

Yes I have on several occasions, the first time that I saw her doing something that she was doing and thought that nobody was around, she was laying down on the couch at my father n laws house and I guess she forgot that I was in the other room lying down while my wife and her dad were taking our kids to a dentist appointment, so as I was lying there i began to hear something coming from the living room and so I quietly got up and made my way down the hallway and once i reached the end of the hallway I peeked around the corner and saw her lying there completely naked and rubbing all over her b

As a matter of fact? I did. She has passed away as of 2006. So has her significant other. While visiting their home, we were bunking in the other part of their huge home and it had a split floor plan. I had been sleeping in late but I caught up and needed an aspirin so, I walked through the living room over to the other part of the house where she was giving him his meds. He had just gotten out of the hospital after having some type of heart surgery. She stood in front of him, handing him his pills. I don't know what he did wrong, but she raised her hand as though she was going to hit him and h 

My mother in law and I don't get along so I don't want her in the delivery room when I give birth. My husband feels that it isn't just my decision to make. Is he right?
My MIL and I don't really get along either. She wanted to be be around for the birth of my daughter, but when she was visiting in summer a month before giving birth, I made sure to tell her I only wanted my husband and MY mom there with me. She told me I shouldn't be dramatic and that giving birth isn't as bad as they say. She even convinced my husband that I shouldn't get an epidural and that contractions are not painful. She said she just laid in her bed and would check her watch occasionally and only got embarrassed when the doctor asked if a student could be present. Well, after 18 hours o 

My mother in law and I don't get along so I don't want her in the delivery room when I give birth. My husband feels that it isn't just my decision to make. Is he right? TL;DR: I’d recommend reading “Boundaries” by Drs. Cloud and Townsend — before Baby comes if at all possible. The audiobook is very worth it, and is excellently narrated, if that works better for you. Emotional Answer: I’ve offered to my husband that his mom is allowed in during delivery so long as he is willing to take a four hour shit in front of my mom and his mom, letting them comment about the features of the toilet and sanit 

I don’t think it’s fair that one person should be able to make unilateral decisions that affect the both of you; on any topic or activity. However, in this case, there is more weight behind your wishes. The both of you should be capable of discussing this like mature adults and come to an agreement that considers what’s at stake. I doubt that your husband’s desire to have his mother present is stronger than your desire to not have her watching you during a very personal and vulnerable time. I’m going to be a bit graphic here because it more accurately illustrates my point… you want to be able to 

It is your decision, and yours only, as to who you want in the delivery room with you. When my eldest grandchild was born, her mother invited me to be in the room through the labour, and said she wanted me there for the delivery. At the last moment, she then said she didn’t want me there, just wanted my son and her own mother there. I was disappointed, but I hid it from her and left the room, because, again, it was her decision, and hers only, who she wanted there. When my twin grandsons were born, their mother didn’t even bother to let me know she was in labour, or to tell me the boys had actua 

Your husband is absolutely wrong. Yes, it may be his baby, but YOU must be comfortable and feel safe while delivering it. Go with your gut feeling and let him know in no uncertain terms that delivering a baby is very tough on the mom, and anything that makes you tense or uncomfortable is bound to have a bad outcome. My MIL is a nice person and I generally get along with her, as long as it's not for more than an hour at a time. She is also fixated on taking pictures. With our first son, she asked and we allowed her into the delivery room. She occasionally made a nuisance of herself and annoyed th 

He is WRONG. It is 100% your decision to make. Whats more, you can also make the decision for HIM to not be in the room during the birth of your child. I'm sure that's not a decision you want to make, but it wouldn't hurt to remind him of that. As the patient, it is completely up to you to decide who you want in the delivery room with you. Yes, childbirth is amazing. Bringing a new life into the world is something to be excited and celebrate about. That said, it is also messy, embarrassing, painful, and leaves you in a position of complete vulnerability. By embarrassing I don't mean that you sh 

When I was born in 75 my father was not present. I had assumed he was at sea since he was in the navy but once in my 30s I was surprised to learn my mother didn't want him there for either my sister's birth or mine. My parents are both very ahead of their time regarding gender roles. My mother is a very forceful woman and my father is a guy who always helped around the house. I was surprised because it seemed so old fashioned. I said to my Mum, “surely the hospital was letting men in by then.” “Oh no,” she said. “I didn't want him there.” Mystified I asked why and my stunning and immaculately styl 

If you do not get along I cant imagine anything worse. When I had my first child it was like a party in my room even my sister was there it was amazing and all of the support was wonderful.There was laughter and tears and a true bonding of all the people in the room,it brought everyone closer for a time. When my daughter gave birth, I and the other grandma to be were both in the room. She was polite and tried to give my daughter privacy while she was being checked by nurses and doctors etc. She would turn her back or walk out into the hallway.This woman and I didnt really get along,no arguing o 

I have read most of these answers, and they are all spot on…. but… there is one more point that you should raise with your husband. (BTW, I think your husband is not only wrong, but kind of an idiot for turning your medical procedure into a way to make his mommy happy.) It could be potentially dangerous for both you and the baby to have a person that you don’t get along with in the room. If you and MIL have any kind of personality clash, it will take one of the most stressful situations that you are ever likely to experience, and pump it full of steroids. Stress is dangerous for both mother an 

I know there are already plenty of answers to this question, but I feel compelled to add my perspective as a certified Doula and student Nurse on a Nurse-Midwife track. Short answer: NO, he is not right. I am not negating the profound experience of becoming a father and the importance of paternal involvement, but his body is not on the line here. Giving birth will likely be one of the most significant and challenging events in your lifetime, and it is of UTMOST importance that as a laboring mother, you feel as safe, supported, and comfortable as possible.

What does it feel like to have no friends showing up on your wedding day?
What is usually considered husband material?
I know what doesn’t. Reverse the bold for good. Men who are disrespectful. They talk and disseminate negative things about other people, themselves and about their partner. Their lives are examples and experiments of embarrassment and social faux pas. They want to be respected and goes around thinking ‘respect is earned’. Actually, ‘respect is given where is due’. They get away with their peers but not by their higher ups and bosses. And that’s why they are not respected but couldn’t understand why. The actual ‘big wigs’ just see them as a joke and talks fluff. They soon will find out the hard 

These are the 10 qualities you need to look for in a man, the ones that tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that he’s the one and this is it and he  1. He loves your good qualities, and accepts the bad.  Without making you feel guilty for having flaws.  You don’t need to hide your true self from him and put on a front in order to be what you think he wants. You can share your true self and be vulnerable and feel safe doing so, knowing that if anything it will make him feel even closer to you.  2. He is there for you when you need him, even if it’s inconvenient for him.  A partnership 

My perspective puts faith first. After that, you have to become your own man and live intentionally. I wrote an article a few years back that tries to explain my ideal model of marriage and how the roles intertwine and weave together. I’ll paste it here: Ballroom Dancing: My Ideal Model for a Relationship To me? Ballroom dancing is the most beautiful and sublime expression of a masculine/feminine relationship.

Every girl dreams of her prince charming, the perfect guy for her who will take her into her magical dream world full of love. She wants him to be the best for her. Of course, no single guy is perfect or possesses all the qualities a girl dreams about, but trying a bit to incorporate a few good qualities goes a long way and make your relationship better and your life happier.

I dated a man for 5 years and he could never put me as his priority. I met my husband through our parents (arranged marriage) and in 15 minutes, I could see that he was a man I could see having a future with. I don't know what makes good husband material, but here is what makes my husband the best person to share my life with. 1. He is invested in the relationship: whatever decision he takes, he will always check with me first. That shows that he sees me as a functioning, thinking and valuable part of the duo, who's opinions on his decisions matter. We never take decisions for the relationship w 

It happened 4 years back while I was working with Philips, India. There was this young chap, Rohan, 25 something, who recently got married. On his first day at the office after his marriage vacation, he got some sweets to share with all of us. We are some 120 people on the floor. Once we received the email “Wedding sweets at my desk. Please help yourself.”, all of us rushed to his desk. The crowd thickened at his desk and I had to wait for my turn while listening to the people congratulating him. All women were like ‘Rohan! Congratulations.’,’Rohan! All the best’...blah blah..but I saw most men  

They must have enough strength! (not talking about erection but ability to control the feeling of excitement &amp; attraction towards other women)Those who make good sons.

Men who remain calm in a crisis No matter who you are married life will be full of storms that you’ll have to weather together. Life happens. Job losses, death, health issues — all these things will affect you both at some point and the type of guy who makes a great husband is one who knows that panic is not a strategy. Someone who can keep calm and stay on your side, knowing that you two can support each other through anything is the only kind of man worth having. Men who are family people One of the best indicators that he’s husband material is that he is close to his family and treats them wel 

What's the most shocking thing you found in your spouse's possessions?
In June of 2019, my husband walked into the house after arriving from an overseas business trip. Looking quite healthy and remarkably tanned even though he was on business in an office daily in Poland. I questioned how he managed to look so tanned like he’d lay on a beach for a week. I've been with him for 25 years so I know him well. He remarked that it's very hot in June in Poland- they were having a heatwave. Not sure about that. He lives in South Africa where we see temperatures up to 38 degrees and he never looks that tanned. Anyway he came into the house after being dropped off via a taxi wi 

A few years older than me, my fiancee Richard was working for a civil engineering firm when I was still a student. When their grandmother’s house was for sale after her passing we purchased it in his name. The price was too good to pass up as no one was willing to go through the removal the 60’s themed wall paper and shag carpeting and we spent our weekends peeling and pulling at it all to find it a fine little home once the dayglo color scheme was gone. Though, there was still the question of the pink toilets to be tended to, we settled in for winter and spent more time enjoying the fire plac 

First, I should tell you that I was a very traditional Chinese girl who valued “sex” and “marriage” very much. I could not tolerate my partner to have had any sexual experiences before. It was very ridiculous, wasn't it? His past experiences should have nothing to do with me. But I just could not understand and pardon his past history. When he was not at home, I began to search his suitcases and belongings. I was trying to find some of his secrets that he had never told me. You must have already known the things I found. I did feel shocked by them. I found his diaries written in Montreal just af

It was 18 years ago, and I’ve only just found the courage to say that word. I find it so shameful. It is still difficult for me to imagine how anybody, especially somebody who is supposed to love you, can leave you penniless in the world. Before he died, he arranged for his pension to be paid to the Human 

When my wife was 19, her step sister was killed by being knifed in her belly on her 17th birthday as punishment for biting a guy who had been invited to abuse her, 6 days previously. She had known for almost a week that she was going to be killed, and instead of trying to escape from the household they lived in, she had just accepted that she was going to die. I found a letter to my wife from her step sister that she had written in her last hour alive. It was the most awful and beautiful thing I ever read. It said “To my best friend and big sister, I'm sorry. In an hour you're going to watch me d 

What's the most shocking thing you found in your spouse's possessions? In June of 2019, my loved one walked around the house resulting in appearing from an abroad work outing. Looking extremely solid and shockingly tanned regardless of the way that he was on business in an office consistently in Poland.  I tended to how he sorted out some way to look so tanned like he'd lay on a coastline for seven days. I've been with him for an exceptionally lengthy timespan so I know him well. He remarked that it's hot in June in Poland-they were having a heatwave. Not secure with that. He lives in South Africa  

Christmas presents. As background: My husband has an ex and 3 kids in another country. When we were still young and new but definitely getting serious I tried to embrace the notion of potentially becoming a stepmom. He wouldn't let me talk to them on the phone though; he still hadn't told them about me. Well, I wasn't thrilled about that; we were actively trying to start a family, but I took the “in your own time” approach. After all, conceding that you would not be moving back to where your kids can visit with you is a very hard conversation. So I made my approach to the kids through a less dire 

A porn DVD. But the reason it shocked me isn’t because I had a problem with porn. My exhusband ran a website where people could get jobs in the porn industry. So we were both pretty openminded about porn. He was a lot more vanilla than me. I would make coupons for sexy things and give them to him as gifts..months would go by, and the coupons were still in a drawer. I would suggest that I dress sexy, in a red wig, and pretend to be a stranger and we meet in a bar, then get a room in a hotel..he never seemed that interested in any of that. (Yet later, when we were separating, he told me I never w 

A duffle bag full of AA batteries and a voice-activated tape recorder. My ex-husband always seemed like a calm, normal guy. He never argued. About once a year, he got angry about something. If I WANTED to argue about something, he just wouldn’t answer. When I got angry about something and said something mean, he wouldn’t answer. Things started going haywire when I told him I was unhappy in our marriage. He started picking arguments with me. He started saying bitter, angry things to me. I didn’t realize he had other people talking to him and stirring him up, so I didn’t anticipate the things he s 

Not me but my wife.Some years ago my wife was searching for an item of clothing for my son, she inadvertently came across my stash and I'm not talking weed I'm talking my female attire, you see I crossdressed from a very young age and had many years where my quirk lay dormant. I never felt the need to tell my wife as it was not something that I'd thought about in a long time and also its a very embarrassing thing to divulge.it was my 30th birthday when she found it and quite the shock when she confronted me about it. (I'm 53 now) I clammed up when she mentioned it though she did assume I was 

Why do people improve themselves after a divorce but not during the marriage?
What is a stand you took with your in-laws that you will never apologize for?
My stand was not with my husband’s parents, but with my brother in law’s wife. My husband’s family is very tight knit. They will close ranks pretty quick when they don’t have a warm fuzzy feeling about someone. They have always kept her at arm’s length. She always behaves like she is the queen of the world and everything has to be her way. After my husband and I had been married a little over ten years, BIL, wife and their sons came down to visit us in South Carolina. I prepared for their visit for several weeks in advance. I had sent them pamphlets for places we liked to visit so they could pl 

Im 25, mom of 3, all under age 5, and breastfeeding all 3. Its not uncommon that im wearing panties, and cowgirl boots, or pj bottoms and cowgirl boots around the house. Okay. My house. My boobs. My husband likes it, the kids rush in for snacks, my husband doesnt allow me to wear bras, and Im over being shy about it. Im topless when the boys are here much of the time ( my husbands friends), or my gfs. My inlaws-mom and dad, arrived unexpected one day, catching me in panties only, cleaning. Without thought I invited them in before any effort to find a shirt. You would think the She-Devil arrived. She  

I met my then boyfriend at 18 and we became quite serious quite quickly. However, he had quite pushy parents who wanted him to join the military. His whole family had been in the military but he was of a lot more sensitive nature and it wasn't something he was actively engaged in pursuing. After some discussions we agreed we would move in together instead. This was quickly vetoed by his parents and before I knew it I had a ring on my finger and was 300 miles away from home. My husband started to travel a lot and everytime he came home, he became more and more withdrawn. We’d have conversations  

Not me, but my mother. **I am answering anonymously to preserve my privacy. My relationship with my paternal grandfather was once great, but as I got older it declined rapidly into one reminiscent of obvious dislike. In theory, I probably reminded him too much of his oldest son, my father. I am the chip off the ol' block, so to speak. My father did not have a son, but he got a daughter that was undeniably his. That being said, dad, grandpa and I, we all share a common trait: we are strong-willed, determined, and will fight you until you are blue in the face. This is probably why the three of us  

My husband fell into what appeared to be a mid-life crisis a good 10 years ago. He became withdrawn, unhappy, bored, and unfulfilled with life in general. He emotionally disconnected from his parents first, then my family and his friends, and then from me and his kids. It's like a switch was flipped and he became another person overnight. At 40 he quit his job as a managing director for a big company and he started his own company which based him frequently overseas in Poland many months a year since 2015. With that he withdraw from us more and more. My husband was gone and a stranger was left in 

My father in law had asked my husband, new baby and I to come help him start up a greenhouse business in Bozeman, Montana. Prior to this invitation my husbands parents had been terrible to me saying that I wasn’t good enough for their son and refusing to come to our wedding. This issue was never resolved. The first day we pull up after an exhausting 8 hour drive with an infant who just wanted out of his car seat, and instead of saying proper hellos my ( now ex) husbands father came out, ignored me, took my baby out of my arms and walked into the house and disappeared. After freaking out and th 

My stepson. I am married to a man whose son was 7 months old when we got involved. When his son was 3 years old, we got married. My MIL refused to allow my husband's son to be involved with me claiming to anyone and everyone that I would not be a suitable mother to him. When my stepson was 9 years old, he was finally allowed to live with us. He was given a call collect card to use to call his grandmother if I were to ever physically discipline him. When my parents in law came to visit he would always be expected to take time off school as compensation because of some grievances I had done agains 

Actually my first in-laws were wonderful people. I will never apologize for, nor regret caring for them both. Neither of them lived long enough. Clyde, my first husband's father, was a wonderful man who would quite literally give the shirt off of his back to most anyone who needed it. He would often invite people over to their house for a meal, and a bed if they needed it. Doris was always willing to provide a wonderful dinner for these people, often at the drop of a hat. It didn't matter their color or their nationality. Doris and Clyde were good people. He was an Army medic who served in Vietn

Even my ex fil said he acted more like their sibling than their dad. After awhile my daughter would call me every time she would go over because grandma would expect them to clean the whole house while she didn't lift a finger and their dad wouldn't say anything against his mom because she is disabled (although she can work in the garden and other physical things she claimed she couldn't clean the house).

What's the most useless thing your significant other or spouse ever bought?
This is just me, as I am single. I once bought a steam buggy after watching the infomercial over and over. Also, I may have been drunk. Now, the steam buggy is fine for what it is. It's a small steam cleaner. The problem is that most people don't need a steam cleaner. What they need is a vacuum. Using a steam cleaner on, say, a carpet spill will do nothing to clean it. In fact, it just chemically fixes the stain in place. Also, it's an awkward device, and despite how easy the infomercial makes it appear, it just sucks. So, it was wasted money. But, as with any infomercial, wait, there's more. Seve 

An electric cheese grater. He saw it at a shop and kept going on about it. I point blank refused to purchase it and all the way round the store he kept going on and on about being able to have grated cheese on tap. I pointed out that we had a perfectly good manual grater at home, we could buy grated cheese in bags, he never cooked so grating cheese wasn’t exactly his problem and basically it was an expensive novelty that would soon end up in the cupboard unused. He pestered until we left the store but I stood by my guns and I thought that was the end of it. Guess what I got for Christmas. I could 

A2A by Sara Tung My significant other had bought this for me, but not for him a few months ago. So sweet of him! He had been to Hyderabad alone (usually we both go). After his return he said “Vijaya a surprise for you. You like cute kitchen gadgets isn’t it? So here I bought it for you. Our sister in law and family had been to ‘China Bazar’. There they purchased these things. I thought you may also love them so I bought them for you”. Hearing the words and kitchen gadget I became elated. He took out from his bag two packets. One packet contained this:  It is called slicer cum chopper cum grater cum cu 

If anyone had asked me this in 1975 I would have said "SWTPC M-6800 kit", which was a collection of electronic parts and chips and wires for building a computer. I was dumbfounded and not pleased that he had chosen to spend money on such a thing, and I recall thinking it was a pretty crazy idea that anyone might ever need, or want, a computer in their home. For a long time my husband and his brother commandeered our dining table for the assembly of those bits and parts into our first "home computer", which had to be programmed in binary code - just a bunch of 1s and Os. That thing is sitting on 

It wasn’t the most useless thing my ex husband bought, it was the most useless thing I bought for him. For over a year, he spent every Sunday morning Fly Fishing while I slept in. It was heavenly. He had an old ratty used tackle box and pole which I thought was unusual as he never bought anything used. Even if he was only going to use something once and never again, he would always buy the top of the line and then throw it away. But he claimed he bought it used for luck. Something about energy and all that as it was like his granddad’s. Sometimes he would make a mistake and claim it was his, but  

Well, there was the second kitchen table that sits next to our original kitchen table. There’s only two of us living here. We did NOT need two kitchen tables. And the original kitchen table can handle six people plus we have abundant counter space, if we ever have people in. BTW, if you wanna buy that second table, it’s for sale here: 1970s convertible pine table - furniture - by owner - sale Speaking of furniture, and tables and that… we live in a seashore area. I’ve tried to make our decor seashore-ey. Then two weeks ago, my hubs brings in yet another unneeded table, which he found at a thrift s 

Bit of an odd one… When my wife first moved down south to be with us, she worked temporarily as a bus driver. Dull, but paid the bills. She came home one night, beaming. “Babe, BABE! Listen! They are selling off old stock of double deckers. I’m thinking we should get one and use it to go camping with’ I just stared at her. “Are you for real? We have a top-of-the range tent because you decided that you loved camping. We’ve used it twice!” Then the immortal line, used by all those who deep down know their partner is right… “But this is different!” Oh God. She planned to rent a barn £300/month, park the  

My husband once bought a hydrogen generator on eBay. When it arrived, he was like a kid on Christmas. Me: “What’s this?” Husband: “Oh, it’s really cool! It’s a hydrogen generator!” Me: “What’s it for?” Husband: “It’s for making hydrogen, of course!” Me: “But why?” Husband: “It was really cheap. And it makes hydrogen!” Husband spent a weekend rigging up the hydrogen generator with a bunch of gadgets, and the following weekend, he invited a couple of guys over to test it out. When they were ready to try it out, my husband carried the hydrogen generator outside. Then he took a balloon and hooked it up to  

A different answer but still worth sharing. It was me who brought something useless and my wife was quick to point it out. Nearly 3 years down the line, I do realize she was absolutely right. A few years ago, my daughter was gifted a toy telescope on her Birthday. She seemed fascinated by it. However, it being a cheap model (Perhaps AU$30–40) it was hardly any bit useful. However, I just got the idea that my daughter really needs a big telescope. My wife pragmatically pointed out that she would just lose interest. To harp upon the point she took us to Sydney Observatory wherein my daughter lost in 

I can list quiet a few items , since hubby is active in Quora let me show the recent one. Kopi luwak from Indonesia. Yes , he got me digested shit of an animal (technically) and insisted that I give it a try. I am a coffee person but simple filter coffee or instant coffee will do the job. But my hubby , who is bent upon treating me like a queen , bought the expensive coffee to impress me. I didn't even know how to react. its been 2 years &amp; the pack is safely stashed in my cupboard and I have absolutely no idea of ever trying it. Hopefully one fine day I will find a way to use it , just like my ot 

What should I do? My GF is saying that either we get married or she will dump me. We have a 7-year relationship but I'm still not ready to get married. I love her but she is leaving me unless we arrange a wedding in the next 3 months.
Every relationship gets to a point where you decide to get married or break up. Both of you need to break up. I was in your girlfriend’s shoes. Thankfully I wasted 2, not 7 years of my life with a guy. Those types are never serious nor ready for that level of commitment but too scared of being alone. Same thing; had the DTR with him. Later he surprised me with a beautiful proposal, but shortly after, the engagement was extremely stressful; nothing changed. One day he’s like yes let’s get married and next day oh I’m not sure. It was exhausting. Wedding planning helped me get away from that stress  

Been married several times and I’ve got to give you two ends of the spectrum. On one hand, marriage is for suckers. I mean you’ve been with her for 7 years. What have you not done that you can only do in a marriage? File joint taxes? Guarantee each other’s inheritance? Visit in the hospital? Get on the other’s insurance plan? All stupid reasons to get married. You mentioned something about different countries? Immigration is actually a good reason to get married. Other than that, a cynic would say it sounds like she’s got other plans for you or your fortunes. He’d say “If I was in your shoes, I’ 

My grandma had a saying for this. “Shit. Or get off the pot.” If you don’t know that you want to marry a woman after 7 years (!) of being in a relationship, then you need to figure out your mind and fast. I told my (now) husband after less than a year of dating that I was going to have to make a job decision in the next few months. I needed to have a firm decision from him on whether or not we were going to get married or not before I decided to stay where we were living at the time or move back to be closer to my family. I was not staying without a ring on my finger, or at least a firm propos 

Your gf said that to you? You mean your “girlfriend”? 7 years, and she's still your “gf”. Wow! Seven years she's been acting like your wife, you've been treating her like a wife. Sleeping in her bed each night, nursing you through sickness, washing your clothes, sucking your dick…. 7 fuckin' years you've been sucking the youth out of her and you don't respect that woman enough to ASK HER to honor you by becoming your wife.., and she wants to get married. She should have left you a long time ago. You are abusive and self-centered. If after 7 years you “are not ready”, then you really need to give her 

I had a fiancé just like you. He wasn’t ready after many years, almost 7. I one day got sick of his not being ready to just grow up and figure out what he wanted in life and I left him. Two years later (after being with HIM for 7) I was not only married, I was pregnant. No joke. So all these years later, I am happily married to someone else with a child. Coincidentally, my ex-fiancé lives 7 blocks from my new house. We stayed friends on FB, and I got a little concerned about the fact that we both live in the same small town. I looked up his address, wanting to be sure I wasn’t going to run int 

Wow this sounds familiar. I also had a 7-year relationship, in which she wanted to get married and I “wasn’t ready to.” I have to say, your girlfriend is being pretty kind, respectful, and vulnerable to express her needs to you. My girlfriend simply got frustrated, and ended the relationship. In fact, I think most women would just leave. What you have to understand is that your girlfriend loves you, but she also has important life goals which include marriage and probably family. These are very important to her. What you should ask yourself is “Why am I not ready?” For me, there were some important as 

This is a tough &amp; hard question to answer since so many variables can affect you &amp; your decision so I’m just going to try and do this on a basic and “Man to Man” kind of talk. As you’ve said, you have a 7 year long relationship and I will presume that you &amp; her are “In Love” , that you both do truly care for one another and enjoy time spent with each other and consider the past 7+ years a good investment of time. You then need to ask yourself “Why am I not ‘Ready’ for Marriage”? What is holding you back ? What are you afraid of ? What else do you feel you need to do before you feel like you wil 

I knew a guy once that was in a 5 year relationship but he just wasn’t ready to “settle down”. I talked with him a bunch of times about it because he was such a nice and kind guy and the girl was the love of his life and he would only ever get married and have children with her, he said. He couldn’t explain why not now. She was patient and seemed to be okay with the arrangement though. Fast forward 6 years. Whatever barrier makes the thought of being committed so impossible to him has not diminished. She is now in her late-ish 30s and he knows she wants kids. So he tells her she should forget h 

This is such a great question and I’m so glad you made the decision to ask it. NEVER let someone pressure you into marriage! PERIOD! Marriage is a TREMENDOUS commitment and an AWESOME responsibility! If you are not ready, you are NOT READY! NO ONE should pressure someone into marriage and, quite frankly, no one should WANT to pressure someone into marriage! People who want to get married, but are with a partner who feels they are not ready, can ALWAYS leave and go meet someone else, but NO ONE should ever pressure someone into getting married! Let me offer you some thoughts. Many women and men  

Generally, I think giving ultimatums are distasteful. However, context matters, and in the context of a 7 year relationship, I don't think its particularly unreasonable. What you need to do is to be honest with yourself. Question 1: Do you want to marry her? Possible answers: No. If this is your answer, I think its obvious that you have an irreconcilable difference. Your relationship is over, maybe it even lasted too long. You have to accept this and move on, and allow her move on.Maybe/I'm not sure. If this is your answer, we'll come back to that shortly.Yes, but not in 3 months. This also requir

I noticed a trend lately of negative responses regarding Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and was wondering why people do not like or support her as a person or her marriage?
I can't answer for everyone, but I can tell you why I'm not overly fond of Meghan. At one point it appeared as if she was stalking Harry. She turned up at one of his friends wedding, without being invited and spent the whole reception glaring at everyone who talked to Harry.In the engagement interview she kept cutting Harry off, talking over him and pushing him into the background. He barely got a word out.He had her engagement ring made from a medium diamond from Botswana, where they took a trip together, flanked on either side by slightly smaller diamonds from his mother's collection. She had

Some people just love to hate. Meghan was a working actress with a good reputation for being a hard worker, who met a prince most of have known since infancy and had a lovely wedding that made England a ton of money. From that point on it was all hate all the time. Piers Morgan got a bee in his bonnet about her and let her have it nightly, the press began running stories on how the ‘difficult’ Meghan kept firing people, as told to them by ‘palace insiders’, who might have gotten fired for telling stories out of school. Then it became what she wore, no stockings in August, red nail polish. She  

Firstly I would like to call your attention to the answer that Juliet Toler gave, and I congratulate her on it….WELL DONE!!!! The engagement ring - it was beautiful - a medium diamond with 2 smaller diamonds each side from his mother’s collection…..she wasn’t happy with that, she had it remade with bigger diamonds. Gosh, I have 3 sapphire surrounded by 6 diamonds, it isn’t huge, but I love it because my husband gave it to me all those years ago… Harry didn’t get to meet her family, especially her father. Prince Charles walking her down the aisle - her father wasn’t able to be there - wouldn’t you 

Meghan &amp; Harry : Hey I want out of the public eye. I want privacy! I can’t take the nonexistent racist comment towards me and my kid. Also Meghan &amp; Harry : hey look I’m pregnant I’m 6 months already but I will just announce it during Valentine’s Day. Also I’m going to have interviews with Oprah. Because during my time as D list actress I never got the chance to do it. recently the Queen release a notice Harry will be stripped off his military and patronage’s leaving the style and title of HRH &amp; Duke and Duchess of Sussex RESPECTING their decision they want to be out of public service. Guess what 

Here’s my theory behind the hate: A lot of people have felt possessive of Prince Harry since childhood, especially since he lost his mother. Then he grew up, had his wild years, his brother married, and Harry became The Lonely Prince, looking for his Perfect Bride and True Love. She had to be someone really special, really extraordinary. Then he met Meghan. She was biracial. Slightly older. An actress. Already divorced. Had some family drama. She was, in other words, an ordinary person. There were now two options — accept that Harry was also an ordinary person and not the romantic Lonely Prince, 

Honestly? I thought she was wonderful when she first came on the scene and I was so happy for her and Harry, but too many things didn’t add up. Then there was the tea throwing incident and her appalling behaviour during the Australia leg of their tour. Now I think she is a fake. A vile, self indulgent, disrespectful, ignorant, manipulative piece of … work… who is out for herself and only herself. Any good that she may do in the world has happened purely by accident when she has been in the process of indulging herself or trying to make herself look good. I’m sure she has some redeeming qualities  

I think some people just got carried away with the press stories by dubious informants. And wanted to believe them. This was a woman who was actively involved in charity work including with the UN. Her co-workers said she was a really nice person. After the wedding all we heard was a terrible woman , demanding, rude, snubbing people. We saw her on tour being human and smiling and chatting and being actively involved on every outing they had. We also saw an American woman marrying into a radically different way of life, taking her cues from her husband. There were times when it looked like he w 

People read things like the Daily Mail and the Sun, and other tabloid papers, and they for some reason or other, believe everything that's written, even if it's been proven wrong. They've decided that she is the devil incarnate, that she's disrespected everyone under the sun, and any backlash she gets she deserves, they didn't like her touching her belly when she was pregnant, even though nearly every other woman has, they don't like the way she dresses, the way she talks, the way she holds Harry's hand, the way she blinks. It's all an obsession for them, they swear up and down that they don't  

There is no answer really. People judge based on inaccurate information. They judge based on her racial composition. They judge her for her strengths, and for not conforming with being silent unless spoken to by someone. They judge her by comparing her to her late Mother in Law and her current Sister in Law which is unfair as all 3 personalities, totally different. They judge because Meghan, Duchess of Sussex does not meet their own criteria of what the wife of Prince Harry should be. The tabloids have insulted her, her background, her mother, and her friends. They have attacked and taken adva 

SHE CANT BE TRUSTED. Meghan has presented her self as spoiled… WHAT MEGHAN WANTS MEGHAN GETS. She has double standards, leaked Royal family information to the press yet not a work when she leaks her life in America. She used the race card because of BLM But was fine with play a white person on suits. Where was her alliance to race ? I didn’t hear I will not play a white biracial person. Becoming famous in Hollywood has different Meghan role. In addition when she decided to play the British are racist her makeup (foundation) became darker her face became 4 to 5 shades darker than her hands. 201 views · View upvotes · Answer requested by Denver Rose17Shay Drinkwalter, Freelance Writer/Content Creator/Blogger/Web DesignerAnswered March 14, 2021 · Author has 98 answers and 63K answer views

What is the most despicable thing your in-laws have ever done to you? How did you react? 
I don’t know if I’d call it despicable, but it’s definitely the worst thing they’ve done collectively as a family. In short they ruined my wedding. First off, my husband and I had been together for 7 years and living together for 1, before we had my first son. We weren’t married when I got pregnant and I didn’t want to cheapen our relationship of SEVEN years by running to the alter as if I was ashamed to be pregnant. He and I always knew we wanted kids, so it wasn’t a bad thing at all. We were so happy but knew our families might not be happy about the fact that we weren’t married yet. I wanted

First of all, this is the story of my old Chinese friend. For the convenience of description, I describe it in the first person. About 30 years ago, China's rural areas were still very poor. I got to know my husband when I was in college, at the end of our university. I went home with him for the Spring Festival. We came to his hometown and found that his family was really poor. There were only a few bungalows in his family. But I do not mind, but actively help their family buy new year goods. One day, his sister and I fried vegetable balls together. After frying, I poured the oil in the pan. Whil

This happened about 15 years ago and I would call myself someone who lets things go and just not hold grudges and I am not bitter. I’m positive. However my in-laws put some thing on me that was just so effed up and I actually have never had anyone do something like this to me. Basically my husband’s grandpa will call him Nick was somebody that I had a special relationship with him I bonded with him at my wedding and him and my grandpa who were both at the ageReally became good friends at my wedding I routinely wrote him notes and you know was really we were friends and I admired him basically  

I used this story in a previous question, So when I was twenty, I married the love of my life. He was so perfect, in every way I could imagine. He and I were meant to be, I just knew it! When the wedding planning was going on, I desired to invite everyone in my family, even my dreaded sister-in-law. My brother had married a few years ago, and with his wife we both gained a terrible addition to the family. But my sister-in-law, the sister to my brother’s wife, hated me in every way. I had no idea why, but I thought that inviting her to my wedding would help bring peace between the two of us. Big  

My first two in-lawses (hahaha) were wonderful. We all got along, enjoyed each other’s company and never had any issues. I was really lucky. Until my last ex. His mother was a beast (not kidding). She hated everyone and everything. She continually tried to get my daughter and his daughter (we both had one) to do what she wanted, when she knew we had plans for the girls. Fortunately, neither of them ever fell for it, and my daughter in particular would ask why she did this. It was unsettling having to answer it for her, as I’d only ever enjoyed great relationships with in-laws previously. She go 

Why does my daughter's friend get free lunch at school even though she brings a different snack to school every day and her mom drives a brand new car?
My kids get free lunches because we get food stamps. My son (high school) always eats at school. My daughter (elementary school), is a picky eater and takes her lunch half the time. I just bought a brand new 2019 Kia two weeks ago. So new, that I haven’t even received the paperwork from the bank yet. Judging by your question, you are going to judge us based on that little bit of information that I provided What you don’t know is how we came to this situation. The food stamps, we received $20 per month. That’s it. Because of that tiny bit, I don’t have to stress about whether my kids are eating wh 

Because becoming poor doesn't mean you automatically lose everything you've ever had. I lived on the streets for 6 years and I had an iPad the whole time, as selling it might have fed me for a few days, but owning it kept me sane in a very physically and mentally difficult situation (I was able to make music on it, which is emotionally helpful, could keep in touch with friends and family which helps keep you stable, and I could watch things and listen to music to help myself “escape” for a while). A lot of people judged me for living on the streets with that, or thought it meant I couldn't rea 

Obviously I don't know the circumstances of your daughter's friend but there could be numerous explanations. Maybe sometime you could ask her parents if it could be polite. My sons get free lunches with our food stamps. I like how food stamps cover all kinds of foods now and I can choose organic. I've always been focused on organic/natural for my adult years and I know how to shop carefully and most days I provide my sons with healthy lunches to bring to school. But they can also get free lunches on the days something is available for them. They are vegetarians so a lot of the meals aren't rea 

That’s an extremely judgmental question. In short, first, you do not know the circumstances of the person. Second, you do not have to be homeless and starving to receive school lunches or WIC or a lot of state and federal benefits. I grew up with divorced parents. My father made great money as union negotiator and he paid his child support…and that was mostly it, other than an occasional gift (and occasional visit). My mother mostly stayed home to take care of us, only working part time around our school schedules when we were young. We qualified for some of those benefits. Often we just didn’t 

Clearly, her mom is smart. I'm just kidding but serious at the same time. Out of curiosity, what sparked the question? I ask this because the only person who can answer is the mom and unless she has a quora you will only receive suggested interpretations, not an exact answer. Being it so personal I would ask the lady myself, in a personable manner of course though I feel I know her response already. Lastly, you cannot judge a book by its cover, I will add personal info here for this one, my son qualifies for free lunch at school being that I myself at a point in time received assistance. That  

as a university student，I also get the same question to you sometimes. One of my classmates applied student subsidies every year. This found is supposed to help those students financially in need finish their college. But she has a lot of clothes of expensive brand，like ugg and is equipped with Apple computer.（I don’t know whether the prices of Apple or UGG things are expensive or not for a student，but in China they are，especially for a student！）And She go travelling frequently. Even in a two-day weekend before finnal tests when students usually close themselves into libraries and review what  

The most likely answer is that you live in a community that under federal or state rules qualifies for free lunches for everyone in the school district who applies for them. Many communities meet the guidelines for every student to get a free lunch, free breakfast, free weekend backpack and free summer lunch/dinner program. In the age of COVID, that means they would also qualify for an automatic food stamps/SNAP food replacement subsidy or free food deliveries to their homes. But it could also mean that they bought or leased that nice car, or get to drive one as part of an employee perk for wor 

First I’m wondering how you know she gets free lunch? Where I live, every single student has to type in their student Id number (even my kindergartener) to buy lunch. Parents put money on the kids account or they get free lunch. But no one will know if it’s free, not even the teachers. As for the snack, free breakfast and lunch doesn’t include the snack during class. If the parent doesn’t send a snack, they wouldn’t have a snack to eat while everyone else in the class eats. I don’t really know what you mean by “different” and “expensive” but I coupon so I get tons of snacks for free. Brand name 

How does having a different snack every day make someone not eligible for free lunches??? Someone please explain this to me because I really don’t know. Are poor people supposed to have the same snack every day??? Are they not supposed to have snacks at all? I mean, the brains of children really don’t really function well when the kid is hungry. Are poor people supposed to be hungry as a penance for being poor? You would think that people would be happy that they parent cares enough to make sure, and can afford snacks for the kid. As for the car, you really just don’t know. Sometimes it is les 

First I would ask, are you completely sure it’s a brand new, 2019 car? Can you be sure it’s not a very well kept 2017 car? A two year old car would be cost effective, dependable, and still look really new. People need cars to get to work. You can be low income and still have a car. Are you sure the car wasn’t given to her, or sold cheaply to her by a friend or family member? My son gets free lunch yet brings his lunch every day. He has some food issues and the list of foods he will eat is tiny compared to the foods he won’t eat. There are 3 foods served monthly in the cafeteria that he’s actual 

What is it like to discover that a friend is secretly wealthy?
What does it feel like to have no friends showing up on your wedding day?
Who is your best friend? Why?
“If you have one true friend you have more than your share.” said Thomas Fuller. “The language of friendship is not words but meanings.” said Henry David Thoreau. In this cruel world, it is tough to find a wise and honest friend. The bond I share with my best friend is quite similar to what I have with my family, or parents but probably it is even deeper. We met for the first time on the 1st of Jan 2010. Initially, we both were equally hesitant to talk to each other. So, it took a while to share a few words. When we finally had our first conversation, we realized that it was worth it. Slowly, we

I'm in a rather n i c e mood today so instead of rickrolling Amy Smith or just being an obnoxious ass in general, I'm going to write this answer to let her know how special she is and how much she means to me. It all started back in early January 2019 when I started to follow Amy. I'd seen some of her answers in my feed and my initial reaction when going through her profile was “she deserves way more followers than she has currently” (she was at 800-something back then).

My best friend is someone that I can trust fully. He is always there for me when I need him. We have many similarities. We have the same middle name and last initial, we both enjoy talking about technology, and we have same political opinions. We consider ourselves to be intellectual equals, and by the same logic, too! (I consider him to be intellectually superior, and he considers me to be intellectual superior, so by logic, that means we’re equal.) We also have many differences. He is a lot more physically active than I am. He is more emotionally resilient than I am, and he and I both know I ca 

I won’t be out here just name dropping my best friends name but I call her ardachokie (it isn’t spelled correctly on purpose) so we’ll go with that. Ardachokie is my best friend I’ve ever had and I have no idea what I’d do without her. She’s with me through everything. When I’m having a panic attack or really stressing one of my coping mechanisms is her. Call, text, whatever I can do. She knows exactly what to do and she’s been dealing with anxiety longer than I have and helps me out. I’m also never embarrassed with her. I could literally tell her anything. I would send the worst picture I’ve ev

A little backstory: we were in same tuitions in 9th std. and we bonded somehow, she being a total idiot but still I used to tolerate her laughter and smile every freaking time ( it was and still is infectious) but she changed the tuitions in between I don’t know for what reasons and didn’t see each other until 11th std when I met her at my Maths tuitions (where she took Economics tuitions {it was combined}), we smiled but didn’t say as if we we 

Barsha❤️ She isn't only my best friend , but my life itself . I would be an incomplete person without her . She is my best partner , soul sister , my mentor , my guide , my crime partner , my heartbeat , my everything . I just can't imagine a life without her . I am a person who used to believe that nobody can love and understand any person completely years ago , but she changed my thoughts . There's no one in the world , who can understand me like her , not even my mom . She can conjecture and surmise my mood through my chats , through my facial expressions , through my silence even. I never eve 

Well, for me I find it very illogical to zero in on a single person as a best friend for the fact that over my span of life, many friends contributed in their special way and in one or the other way they are partly responsible for whoever I am today. But, since this question demands “ who IS your best friend” then, this guy I consider undoubtedly, unflinchingly as my best friend.  Yashdeep Saraswat Over the course of our life, we become responsible and mature, we try to discover ourselves for the very purpose of our existence and like many I was no different.

Since i'm little introvert kind of person and less interactive, i never had any close friend with whom i can share everything.But from the past few years I have a great friend in my life. She is not just my friend but she is my best friend and she is Rohini Hiremath , brilliant and spectacular artist. It has been a journey with her. When i met her first, I never thought that one day she will be my best friend. I still remember the first time when i met her at my workplace and she took her seat exactly opposite to me, and after the first conversation i had with her i was not interested in talking 

Warning - English is not my first language, expect lots of grammar mistakes 😂 I have lots of best friends! First of, Milica She is my first friend ever! We've been hanging for almost 6 years. She showed me what does a term ‘best friend’ means. She showed me how that works. She showed me that nothing is perfect and That friends may fight but they come over it and get out stronger than ever. She didn't have a problem with my acne face, the fact that I'm raised by one parent, that I don't like makeup, skirts, dresses, that I'm short. She loves me the way I am and it's really hard to see her only on  

As a fifth grader, my mother’s boyfriend was verbally abusive and put me down every single day. He made me feel like garbage, saying that my mother should beat me to death because I was a worthless piece of trash. I hated him, but when my mother was around, he was all sweet and kind to me. It was fake. I had only known him for two months when he tried to get our family to move out of our city and into his. Obviously I couldn’t protest; I was a kid and therefore had to follow orders. So I secretly cried, every single night. I loved my life here, in the city I lived in. I loved my friends. I didn

We ended up having sex. (Obvious mature content ahead) Let me give a little bit of a backstory. I was probably 16 at the time, I'm a girl. I had just moved to this new city 5 months ago and ended up becoming really good friends with this girl in my class. Lets call her Z. She was super nice to me and we ended up becoming very close. We would watch movies and hang out all the time and sometimes even sleepover, but nothing ever happend at those sleepovers. We would talk about life and our hopes and the latest gossip in our school or whatever typical 16 year old girls talk about. We never really talk 

I'm a man and my best friend was a woman. It was a strange situation because I had feelings for her that I tried to hide to myself for not losing her. Well, as you can imagine, it ended quite badly. Everything happened about 10 years ago. It'll be quite long to read, I've never told this story in very details to anyone. Sorry if my English is not perfect, I'm not a native speaker. So, that’s the story I was very young, about 12 or 13 years old, when we talked for the first time. At that time, the first mobile phones became popular (you probably remember the old Nokia 3310/3330) and everyone had one

I was responsible for her weight gain. She was fat because of me.

This story has some graphic details that are hard to take. Drugs and life just evaporated who he was. Not a day goes by where I don’t wonder if I could have done more to save him.

They were incredibly good to me also, giving me a place to live for years when I was financially at rock-bottom. I looked on them as my family. Then 2 years ago I moved in with my partner. We looked for a place to live where my friends’ dogs could come and stay with us every year for a month. But for a while we were living in a flat - no dogs allowed.

I gave some home made jam to a co-worker who had given me fruit. He shared it in the breakroom. My supervisor went to each worker and asked what jam they wanted me to make, and insists I make jam for each person. How can I get out of this?
I would ABSOLUTELY make the jam. I would NOT involve HR. Here is what I would do. Start an email conversation with your supervisor and all your coworkers with something like “Jim/Judy has asked me to make jam for everyone on the team. I think this is a great idea and I am happy to make your favorite jam for you.” Explain that they each need to choose a fruit, and how much they need to provide to make jam for both yourself and them. Have them bring the fruit by Friday. Explain that there is a lot of preparation, but some of them will be getting their jam as early as Monday. Be super excited. Mak 

I have two personal stories to share, but let’s start with your boss. First, take a few slow breaths to quiet the righteous anger I would certainly feel in your place. Request a meeting with your boss and explain to them a couple of things. The other person did not get free jam as a co-worker. He got it to reciprocate a favour. He had given you his surplus of fruit, that he grew outside of work, and you made (let’s say) 6 jars of jam out of it. You gave him one as a thank-you. You still have 5 jars for your personal use. And you did it voluntarily, it was not an expectation.Compared to this, yo 

Bizarre. That’s just bizarre. I can’t even fathom the idiocy of a supervisor who did this. Clearly, they’re trying to make some sort of point about treating everyone in the office equally, but it’s just about the dumbest thing I can think of. Of course co-workers sometimes share food with just their friends in the office! And something you made on your own time is not subject to regulation by your boss. The first step here is to respond to your boss. Now, I could see two ways of going about this. The first is to simply assume your boss isn’t being the asshole that he is, and instead assume that  

First you need to analyze the situation, why did the supervisor do this? Either they have it out for you or your delicious jam was the talk of the office. Your supervisor took the focus off you and put it on to them. You are the scapegoat in a classic narc move. Your supervisor is the good guy for taking the time to find out what type of jam each person wants. You will be spun as the bad guy who wouldn't do it, you big meany. If you say something, they will likely accuse you of blowing it out of proportion. It's a lose, lose situation. People like these always have an agenda and they always min 

Huh? So, a coworker gave you some fruit. As a polite and kind gesture, you gave them jam you made from the fruit ( which is basically good manners). The co worker, being nice, shared their jam with your coworkers and your boss somehow feels that not only are they entitled to jam, but so isn't every coworker, though they didn't even have the decency to even provide the fruit! As a Boss, never in a million years, would it ever occur to me to even request one of my employees to make jam or anything else for the matter for my other employees. BTW- technically if you are told to make something for wo 

Original question: I gave some home made jam to a coworker who had given me fruit. He shared it in the breakroom. My supervisor went to each worker and asked what jam they wanted me to make, and insists I make jam for each person. How can I get out of this? First of all Anna, I believe you already realise that your supervisor is completely out of order here and cannot make any demands on your time outside of your normal working hours in this way. Secondly, as others have suggested, do not make any jam for your coworkers. Now I doubt that your coworkers will ask you why you haven’t performed this  

If you don’t want to do it, simply don’t. But if you are not completely against jam making as a company paid service and instead of your regular work duties, this could also be an opportunity for you: Make sure the boss knows how time consuming it is and ask how you should account for time, overtime and any associates material costs including supplies and shopping. It must be plainly evident that your time and expenses will be covered by the company if you do this for the company. Document all this and everything below in email. Prepare a short list of demands or “materials” needed and Company budg

Here's what you do. You look through your supplies, and if you have any extra jam that you wouldn't mind passing on, you come back and tell them… “here is the jam I have. If you would like some I can sell it to you for X price. But my job is this one.. not jam making. And I don't just make jams to order.” As for your supervisor, there is a second option if you don't mind making the jam, and just mind the wierdness.. I would gather together a list of supplies with the retail cost of each item neatly organized. Make it the mid-range to maximum price for each item, and overestimate how much of each 

First, tell the supervisor “NO". If he insist; If you have someone in your change of command above him you get a long with, “unofficially” tell them the situation and see what they say. Tell them you do not want them to step in just yet.Ask from company email, for a P.O. or whatever your company uses to purchase supplies, a petty cash voucher and what contract you will be using for your time? Also ask if you are to do this from home? If so, compensation will be needed for the use of home, insurance hike and utilities or will you or him be looking for a place to rent to make this required jam, or

I gave some home made jam to a coworker who had given me fruit. He shared it in the breakroom. My supervisor went to each worker and asked what jam they wanted me to make, and insists I make jam for each person. How can I get out of this? You don’t explain whether you have a close or closer relationship with the coworker who provided you the original fruit. How many people are in your office (whether one or one hundred, your supervisor shouldn’t have done what he/she did). Did the recipient of the jam make sure everyeone knew you did this just for them when they shared, as perhaps part of an o

Avoid is probably not enough. I was once in my apartment which I was renting with my girlfriend some 10 years ago. She invited one of her girl friends over to our place to see each other and have a cup of tea. She showed up with her boyfriend. It was September, they had just returned from their vacations in Asia. They hadn’t seen each other for months and they were eager to show each other all the cool stuff they had been experiencing. Our vacations were not that exotic as theirs but quite interesting through the Balkans, where my girlfriend got to meet my parents and family. Being from a Norther 

I understand that my answer will probably affect more who lives abroad than who doesn’t and has not interest in leaving his/her own country, but in my fairly long experience away from my own country, what I really came to avoid is people that moved to a country and keeps complaining about everything and everyone there, and constantly talking about how much he/she misses home, and how “things are better there”.For example, I lived in London for a few years, and was sick and tired of talking with Italians (I am Italian, I guess the name tells it) that, holding their slice of pizza take-away bou 

I’ve been living 39 years and in that time I’ve met thousands of people. I’ve worked with people in numerous industries and from all walks of life. I’ve never had the luxury of avoiding a single person or type, and have been thrust into interactions with everyone from the poorest disabled woman to an actual billionaire. Here is my list of the types of people you should unequivocally avoid being friends with, or being kind to. But rather than avoiding them entirely, I would encourage you to speak out against these behaviours. Being able to keep doing what they’re doing in the dark is the reason  

put my two cents in here, excepting a few explanations already given by others: people who are too “nice”. If it ever seems to you like there is something up about the way someone is always too nice, there probably is. Don’t chance it.Socio- and Psychopaths, if you can.Similarly, manipulative and toxic people. My sister is one of these.

Here are the 10 types of people, among other, I try to avoid: 1. The “Askhole” The Askhole is the person who asks for your advice, tells you how wise and helpful it is, thanks you for it, does the exact opposite of what you advised, asks again for your advice on the same problem, and repeats this cycle to leave you eventually feeling like that pair of jeans which has seen one wash too many. 2. The I-me-I This is the person who talks about one thing and one thing only: himself. The I-me-I will leave you bone-tired - physically and mentally - with his incessant talking and almost unendurable, detail 

People who have a negative opinion about an entire demographic but tell you you're "different," or "one of the good ones," so you can be pals. You'll see people who are racist, or sexist, or hate an entire religion or nationality, but then "make an exception" for the few examples of people they happen to know. These people are ignorant and bigots. Don't be friends with them because they happen to like you. People who are perpetually self-destructive but will not acknowledge how their choices damage their lives. I'm not saying you should shun anyone with bad habits. We all have them to some deg

While not nearly as severe as some of the groups of people that were presented here, I’d like to propose the complete avoidance of those people that completely change depending on who they’re in a relationship with. You know, the Beckies and Selenas and Jordans who fall intensely in-love with people they barely know and are ready to put their lives on the line for these strangers, even compromising their being. I’ve met two of these cases so far. One of them was an incredibly meek guy. The type of person who soils himself just because you moved too fast for some reason. He was hopelessly romantic 

People that heavily trash talk their exes. Instant red flag. You loved them once. Give your past relationships respect and move on.People that “one up” all of your stories and achievements. This usually means the person is an extremely insecure and vindictive person who secretly wants you to do badly so that they feel better about their own shortcomings. They’re the kind of friend that just can’t be sincerely happy for you.People that hardcore flirt with people’s boyfriends or girlfriends in front of their partners, often making sure the person notices it. These people suck. These people are o

1. Jealous: Can’t accept that you are better than themJealous friends can’t always appreciate you sincerely and be happy for you like real friends. They often cannot accept that you are better than them, and they may pour cold water on you when you are happy when you have achieved something. They may also treat you as a certain kind of competitor, wanting the same things as you, or developing the same hobbies as you, and want to surpass you.And if they can’t be better than you, they will find ways to destroy your happiness. In order not to see you getting better, they may even sabotage in se 

Here are some that I observe around me : Positivity freaks. These people demand that everything they see and hear or anybody they approach be shining with “positivity”. They will insinuate that positive talk, positive life, only seeing positive things, even being healthy, is a sign of possessing moral highground.Subtle braggers / subtle judges. They have a way of standing on a pedestal that is very subtle. And they can access the pedestal only if they can somehow subtlely judge, by subtlely bragging…. Their good only comes with the bad of others. I prefer an honest bragger.People who feel deepl

Have you been accused of shoplifting and proved your innocence? Did the store employees apologize? Do you feel an apology is owed in this situation?
No, but I have helped a lot of women who were! Once upon a time I had a fabulous job as a shop girl the the china and housewears department of my local Hudson’s Bay Company. I was the youngest person on that floor by a solid 50 years, and I adored my coworkers. You know the feeling you get after a good chat with your grandma? I worked with five grandmas every day! Hands down it remains my favourite job ever. Jean was short and portly, and alway ready to snark about stupidity. Barb was angular and steady and full of advice. Joan was tiny with spiky white hair and a party approach to life. Eevone 

Oh yeah it happend! It was when I was 15, during my exchange year in Russia. I was told I should always be home after the sun went down. Usually I always was. But at this particular day I was in a store for a while. Just wandering around, looking at different things, not realizing that it was about to go dark before I could make it home. It's important to say that my Russian was poor at that time and back in my home country I have never withdrawn money from a cashpoint myself. So all my money came out of the cashpoint as one big bank note. That was what I had in my pocket, way too much money o 

Funny story I tell from time to time. I was in a local Meijer store (picture Wal-Mart but cleaner) with my then teenage daughter. We had done some fairly light shopping and went to exit when the alarm went off. To be clear she had walked well in front of me and it did not go off for her so there is no “you don’t know what your daughter might have done” argument. I look at the greeter who normally will tell me “just go” but this particular lady was having a bad day and tells me in no uncertain terms to come over. Compliance is the easiest path to not having an issue so I do. The next people get  

My youngest son (about 12 y/o then) and I went to Walmart to buy a small desk fan; I was going to actually mount it on the ceiling of my bathroom to circulate air to keep mildew from becoming a problem after my showers (and that is a problem in South Florida because of the excessive humidity). This was late in the evening, and few people were in Walmart at the time. So, we pick the plastic fan that I wanted, and we go to the hardware section to buy the threaded lamp rod, or lamp tube, that I’ll use to mount it to the unused electrical box in the ceiling of the bathroom (I think a heater was onc 

Yes, twice in one city, on the same day in Branson, Missouri. My Mom and I were vacationing there after seeing family in Arkansas. We had been traveling with a video camera that at the time was very expensive. So, I took the camera in its camera bag (with gear) in with me into this consignment store and my Mom had her large purse. She walked around looking, while I stayed at the front of the store with the bag behind my back the entire time as I looked in a few cases that had vintage Transformer toys. I love, and still collect Transformers to this day. I was approached by who was running the s 

When I was about 6, I and my brother and a friend of his rode our bikes to a Woolworth store located about a mile from our house. I didn’t have any money, so I just wandered around the store looking at toys and things. When we started to leave, the security guard grabbed us and told us to come back to the office. He then accused us of stealing things. I didn’t take anything so I turned out my pockets and showed the guy that I hadn’t taken anything. It turns out that my brother and his friend had stuffed some things in their pockets. I said that since I hadn’t done anything wrong, I wanted to l 

Have you been accused of shoplifting and proved your innocence? Did the store employees apologize? Do you feel an apology is owed in this situation? This happened late one night in my local Wegmans. I am generally in there at least two or three times a week and used to go in almost every day. I am often there for a while, and generally go to purchase things several times in the course of a visit. Two or three years ago, during the last hour that they were open, I was going to purchase a few items. I looked at the one register that was open with around four or five customers on line. I was tired, 

Yes, I was with my dad and my brother at a Walgreens. I was like 15 I think. It was after dinner, so I asked my dad if I could have M&amp;Ms, he said yes, on my way to the front I checked the toy aisle because I always had a laugh at the extremely overpriced items. I grab a bag of M&amp;Ms from the front, and I might have put the bag into my pocket (even then I remember not being sure if I did that or not), then I walked to the back of the store where the pharmacy was. I handed the M&amp;Ms to my dad and he payed for them and his allergy medication. While he was paying I heard a female voice behind me say s 

Yes I have. My husband and I were doing home improvement work at the time and went into a small chain of stores located in a very small town. My husband has a lot of tattoos and we get discriminated against A LOT for this even though he's a better man than most could even hope to be. While my husband was looking at tools, I went to go look at some random things and happened to see a vinyl floor tile that was on display that I thought was kind of cool looking. I picked up the tile and went to show my husband. He agreed, and went back to looking at what he needed to get. I went to put the vinyl  

I did, once LONG ago. Being legally blind, I often travel with a folding white cane. Actually, now I use an National Federation of the Blind telescoping cane,) that, when folded, looked like a bundle of four white tubes. I was shopping in a toy store, just looking around, minding my own business, and carrying my white cane folded up in one hand. Needing both hands to examine something on a shelf, I tucked my folded cane into my purse. The cane was longer than the purse could accommodate, so it stuck out at the end. Not finding what I was looking for, finally, I decided I had better look elsewher 

My mother in law takes my baby out of my arms without asking my permission. She also passes my baby around to other people without my permission. How do I put a stop to this behavior without hurting her feelings?
Oh wow…well it’s pretty much up to you to set boundaries. By asking this question, it seems that this is not really a comfort zone for you. However you are now a mom, so strap up. Big girl panties on this one. People will do or treat you the way you ALLOW them too. This is your child first and foremost. I cannot remember a moment when someone took my son out of my hands when he was a baby without me allowing it. Maybe it was my RBF that threw them off, who knows. However my son is very socialized because I was the one that passed him along, allowing him to get comfortable with others. When my moth 

There are a lot of good answers here but one of them resonated with me more than the others and I thought I should tell you why. You are the child’s mother. No one else except the father (maybe) has any right to take the child from you or make decisions for him or her. This includes who gets to hold the baby. More, specifically, when dealing with parents and in-laws, they need to remember that they already raised their children and its your turn. I only came to realize this when my daughter was 10. I wish I had been told it sooner. My situation was different and over a long period of time. My in 

When my second son was born he was very jaundice. His bilirubin levels were fine only his skin and whites of his eyes were yellow and we were told to keep him in the sunshine. In February there aren't many sunny days in Ontario but his room would get afternoon sun right in his crib. And that's where I kept him. Plus, he was a good sleeper. This could be due to his jaundice, apparently, it makes them sleepy. So my SILs come to see the baby. One of them didn't want a family of her own and she concentrated on her career instead. She only loved her nephews while they were babies and toddlers, as i 

While many things connected with your baby will require your “permission”, this probably isn't one of them. Your mother-in-law is from a different generation. She — obviously — loves her grandbaby and wants to share her grandbaby (and her love) with those around her. Unless the baby was a premature birth, or special needs infant, permission isn't required, and allowing Grandmother to share the baby establishes the following: Tolerance — Even if your mother-in-law is the wicked witch of the east, she deserves to have access to the baby. Holding the baby creates a bond, and feel-good chemicals inc

I find that often when people do things that make us uncomfortable it is because we have never communicated to them that it does. I agree with what someone said, that you are allowing your MIL to take your child from your arms, I doubt she is yanking him from you. MY advice is to tell them in no uncertain terms. She might think it harsh at first but will realize it in time. Tell her nicely, “It makes me uncomfortable when you take the baby without asking. I love that you want to spend time with the baby, I don’t mind, but if you could ask me before you do take him/her. I also don’t quite like h 

I had a similar situation, with my MIL. I was a new mother, with no mother of my own. My MIL took me under her wing, and was very good to me. Being I worked nights, on the weekends, and my husband was off on Wednesday’s and Thursday’s, my son would go to gramma’s on the weekends. Now when everyone was at my in-laws house (for a holiday or whatever), I noticed my MIL took over the parental responsibility of my son, even though I was there. I didn’t like this. I didn’t let my son have soda, or a lot of sweets and things like that. Yet my MIL would give in to him. I also noticed his behavior wasn’t  

You’re going to need to set up boundaries and people who have none, like your MIL, is not going to take them very well so you’re going to hurt her no matter what BUT you can still do it in a kind and loving manner. You should never allow someone to disrespect you out of fear of being undermined or have any mistakes tossed in your face, or anyone pressuring you that she should be able to do whatever she wants as the a grandmother. That’s the key word, GRANDmother, she’s NOT the mother, YOU ARE. If there is an issue with the MIL that becomes deeper, your husband should be backing you and the tru 

It took the St Judes Childrens hospital a month to release my firstborn to me back in 1975. On the way home, my stepmother was anxious to take him from my arms. But something happened to me, my heart started pounding, I became terrified that if she got her hands on him- I would never get him back. I felt sick and like getting out of the car and running away! I said NO! Later, I heard this hurt her feelings. But I promise you I didnt choose for the word NO to come out of my mouth it just happened…and I felt like a lioness roaring as I said it. I really couldnt help it. I grew up never having anyth 

Okaayyy, the most popular answers are basically telling you to communicate with her like she’s a lap dog. As much as we’d all like to put MIL’s in that place, wagging hands and fingers is not appropriate to do toward an adult female, especially not one who has control issues. The polite thing to do would be to let her know over coffee or tea or a quiet, private setting, that you want to respect her and will need her to ask for the baby and then take her if you agree. Tell her you know she would want the same respect and you appreciate her excitement to help yet you need a change moving forward.  

Are you kidding me? When I had my first (and only) kid, I was THRILLED to have him passed around to everyone in the room. I was free for a few moments to eat, drink, or godforbid, pee. I knew I’d get him back when it was time for a diaper change or he got cranky for “food.” Of course, my MIL had passed before I married her son, and my family members were just trying to get to know their youngest grandson/nephew/cousin and would not have argued if I’d asked for him back. There was one time when I attended a baby shower with my son when he was only about a month old. One “grandmother” asked to ho 

What are the types of people that you should always avoid?
Avoid is probably not enough. I was once in my apartment which I was renting with my girlfriend some 10 years ago. She invited one of her girl friends over to our place to see each other and have a cup of tea. She showed up with her boyfriend. It was September, they had just returned from their vacations in Asia. They hadn’t seen each other for months and they were eager to show each other all the cool stuff they had been experiencing.

How do I tell my mom to leave me alone? I’m 15 and I’m not allowed to go upstairs in my room until I sleep. She even has to stay with me until I go to “bed”. Every time I call my friends my mom comes into the room and sits listening to us talk.
My mother was like this and I did basically what the other person described about following her around and giving her a taste of her own medicine at about 13yrs old and it worked to a degree. I was able to have calls in peace for a limited amount of time and she wasn’t so eager to be around me when I was the one watching her. She did replace my “free time” with chores, but I’d rather spend time alone washing dishes and vacuuming than be next to her. My mom (as well as my aunt) were control freaks. As I finished high school I got stronger and firmer about boundaries, but perhaps it was cultural 

Despite it's popularity, I disagree with the notion you should imitate your mother's behavior and make her “sick of the very sight of you.” This sounds like a recipe for trouble, to me. Your mother could get paranoid that you're hiding something, or frustrated that you're harassing her, honestly it could go a number of ways and almost none of them are any good. It's not a mature way to the handle the situation at all. Based off your question, her obsession with following you seems to be specific to you being alone in your room. There could be two reasons for this: she's paranoid, or you did som 

I posted this in response to another persons answer when they asked for an alternative to what they wrote. I then had someone say to post it. Here you go: Respectfully ask mom if you’ve done something that was inappropriate. Something offensive. Does she trust that you’ve taken good lessons from her parenting to heart? Then ask why she is behaving the way she is. Explain how it makes you feel and even if it does not change you’ve had some open communication. *This part was in reply to a suggestion that the child mirror Mom’s behavior: Playing this kind of game is ridiculous and only enforces the  

Spend the day following her around the house from room to room and sitting or standing so close to her that she can hardly move her arms. Try to follow her into her bedroom. The bathroom. Crowd the heck out of her. Get into her physical space. When the phone rings, follow her and try to get the ear part away from her head so that you can hear. Ask her to put it on SPEAKER. Ask her who she’s calling. Ask her what she’s writing. Ask her what she’s thinking. If your mother goes outside into the yard or garden, follow her. If she is going out in the car, demand to come along. If she has a friend come to v 

Your mum has got some trust issues I think, and needs help, assuming you are not exaggerating her actions. My grand daughter is also 15, and if her room door is closed we knock and wait for her to say if it’s okay to go in. Most of the time the door is left open, closed usually means she’s catching up on school work, it’s GCSE exams year for her, or she’s at her barre practising ballet moves. Is there an adult you could ask to speak to your mum, (your grandma, an aunty, a friend’s mum) in a nice way, to try to find out why she behaves like this, and to gently explain how it’s not normal to hove 

Wow. That is so inappropriate. You don't have a helicopter mom. You have a parasite. Honestly, I don't think that there's anything you can do, except maybe have compassion for her. Your mom is obviously a very frightened human being, so frightened that her fear prohibits her from having an appropriate relationship with her daughter and from performing her parental duties. (Which include allowing you to grow up.) My guess is that your mother experienced some horrific trauma in her childhood which left her feeling permanently unsafe. She needs therapy. Which you can't do. If you think that your mom wou 

In my opinion and I have some experience here, your mom might have a serious problem. You're best plan of action is not to try to talk to her but look into resources for getting help yourself. She is too attached to you and controlling. If she got this way, she is unlikely to change just because you ask her to. Don't just keep hoping that she will change. Can you get a counselor or speak with a social worker? Can you talk to someone at school? It's really a professional you need to help you learn how to manage your mom's behavior. But make sure you get someone who believes you because, even wi 

She’s obviously very concerned. Have there been incidents in the past that would lead to her feeling she needs to monitor you? Be honest with yourself. Has there been something untoward that she has found out about and disapproved of? Was there a situation where you were in danger from another person perhaps she thought someone was going to take advantage or abuse you? If not… then this is out of order and you’ll have to speak to her Maturely, quietly and calmly and tell her at your age you need a little privacy. Tell her she makes you feel uncomfortable and like a child who can’t be trusted. T 

Invade her personal space as well. If she can do it, you can to. Equal rights equal fights. Gotta influence the youth in a good way, am I right? Here’s how to do it (taken some tips from other people who have answered) -Follow her around. Like, everywhere. To the car, inside the shops, and never EVER be more than 4 feet away from her. -snoop through her stuff. Her phone, her purse, everything! If you find something like a s*x toy or something that could damage her health, scold her and question her about it! If it is something on her phone, interrogate her like she would if she goes through your 

It’s my sense there is a reason for her doing this. You may have crossed the line in her trust and now she will never let that happen again. Regardless of whatever issue there is, I agree with her, bedrooms are for sleeping. Teens are becoming too reclusive. It is not good for their mental health to be fixated on privacy when that level of privacy is not needed by anyone. Privacy is for changing, showers and pottie time. For the rest, you should be engaged in homework, chores and of course your phone calls after everything is done. So, I don’t really see this as a problem. You more or less give  

What can I do about a neighbor who parks their vehicles in my yard?
What you should do is: First, establish that it is indeed your property. Yes, a certified survey. You may want to notify the neighbor that you are having a survey done, and perhaps he would also like to know where the lot lines are. They may apologize right then and there, saying oh, I know where the lot pins are, my bad. You might want to put up a legal fence just your side of or on the actual property line, or whatever setback may be required by local zoning laws. Some twine and flags along the lot line giving a visual reference to where the lots begin and end can go a long way. Or not. It’s  

Funny this question popped up in my feed today. I had an incident today (5/10/20). So, I am African-American--Black if you will, although my complexion is closer to caramel. And yes, this is a race story. I was driving through a neighborhood of non-descript homes built in the 1960s and 1970s. Clean, well kept, but nothing fancy…just standard American suburban housing. I was looking for the entrance to a park with a dog section I'd been told was in the area. I got a bit turned around, so pulled over onto a very short deadend side street to consult Lady Google. I got my bearings, and while sitting  

I live in a mobile home park and we all have 2 vehicle driveways. I have a neighbor with 3 vehicles, I currently have 1, so, what I did was make a deal with him. #1…he can use the empty space but if I have company, he has to move #2..i I get another vehicle,he’ll have to move elsewhere #3..for as long as he uses it, in the Winter, he cleans the entire driveway/cars including mine. That’s worked well for me, haven’t shoveled in 5 years, I’m in New England I HAVE come home a found cars blocking me or on my lawn (which is against park rules) and have announced, LOUDLY. they have 5 minutes to move or b 

I had a similar situation with my neighbor. She continued to use my front yard as her driveway and park the front end of her car vehicle in my yard. At first I approached her and explained that she was ruining my flower beds by parking in them. She stopped for about a week then started parking her entire car on my mulch and flower beds. I had a beautiful mulched area with a flower bed running along side of my yard and it went around my driveway on both sides. The side that was closest to her driveway was a foot away from her driveway so she should have had plenty of leeway. The last time she pa 

Make sure it’s your property they are parking on. Something that looks like it’s your back yard may be a part of a vacant lot or municipal/city property.Make sure they are aware that they are parking on your property without your permission. I would post signs that everyone can see and leave notes on their windshield. Unless it’s blatantly obvious, do not attribute their actions to malice.Consult with local law enforcement about your rights in this case. Depending on the jurisdiction you may have a number of legal actions at your disposal, from having them towed at their expense to preventing 

My neighbor parks in front of my house frequently. I really don’t care , I park in my driveway. I do get upset when they try to park two cars in front of my house. One day, the son came home and parked across half of my driveway. My husband walked over and asked them to move the car. Son was cooperative and went and moved his car. Meanwhile, mommy dear complained that there was not enough parking and they would have to walk too far, because “there is not enough parking”. They have a two car garage and driveway, it was empty. They are in their thirties or forties. Another neighbor parked their R 

This is unfortunate if you do not have a garage at your home. However, unless your community allows people to lease and pay for that space, there’s nothing you can do. You can always park your car in front of his home and then the war really starts. Why do you need this space? Talk to your neighbor and try to compromise. Tell him if he sees a ribbon on a pole you’re expecting guests so can he leave the space open. Or park your car there and let your friends park in your driveway. I wouldn’t buy a home unless it had a two or three-car garage with three parking spaces in the driveway. However, I  

When my parents first moved into their current house there was a pretty popular restaurant/bar on the property in front of it. Shortly after we moved in a bad storm took down about 10–15 ft of fence that separated the properties, they kept it like that because if they had a trailer or big truck that had to get onto the property it was easier to go through the hole in the fence and the owner of the restaurant didn’t mind. For whatever reason people thought they could park on my parents front yard. My dad would go into the restaurant and tell the people with the cars to move them, they wouldn’t, 

When I lived in Westview, a woman visiting next door parked in the middle of my front yard. It was a snowy winter evening and I’d closed my drapes and changed my clothes, so I knew nothing until a guy came to borrow a shovel to help her get unstuck. Being a nice person I said sure, and let them take what they needed. But I watched out the front window and they were trying to pry her car out of the ruts she’d made, with my garden tools, all of which were new. I went out in my slippers and bathrobe and told them all to step away so I could drive her car off my lawn, which I proceeded to do in le 

How long have you been allowing this to happen? If it has been a long time, you may have a problem making a case that this upsets you. Nonetheless, are you sure that the car is on your property? Have you told them not to park in your yard? Let your neighbor know what the next time the car is parked in your yard you will have it towed. Do this by sending a notice to your neighbor by certified mail with a return receipt, and then don’t chicken out, call the towing company. Be a bad ass. Involving the police in a dispute like this will probably not resolve anything, so don’t bother them. If you f 

Have you ever had someone come for dinner at your place and they refused to eat anything?
It hasn’t happened at our house because my wife belongs on the Food Network, but I’ve done it at someone else’s house. Twenty-five years ago, I started a new job and was living on my own in a new city. My wife and children stayed back a couple of months so the kids could finish the school year in our old location, and they made the move when summer arrived. One of my new colleagues invited me to have dinner at his house on a Saturday to meet his family. I was happy to do this and asked what I should bring. “You can bring the beer.” That answer suited me perfectly, and I was ready. The day after t 

Many, many years ago I was newly married to my ex-husband, and struggling to make ends meet whilst on a teacher’s salary. My husband was a student and I was supporting him through his studies. We had very little and if it had not been for my parents’ help, we wouldn’t have made it through most months. The Headmistress of the school I worked at had been very good to me and she and her husband had hosted us at their home, or out to dinner, a number of times. I was frantically trying to save up enough to be able to afford to invite them for dinner, and after some time, I did. I had checked with the 

My ex’s brother got out of prison. He had served 25 straight years for the murder of the man who had killed their father. Honestly, I was very nervous about meeting him, and I had no idea of what to expect. He seemed like a humble guy, very nice and respectful when I finally did meet him. He was quiet and reserved. And very polite. But he never could quite get settled in any one place. He wasn’t on parole, and had very little guidance as to how to find a job and a place to live, and he just wandered around, panhandling for spare change and sleeping on park benches and at truck stops. He showed 

When I was in my early twenties, I shared a tiny house with another girl, who was called Sue. There really wasn’t much in the way of ready-made food in those days, and we tended to cook a home-made meal most nights, taking it in turns. We were VERY poor: although we lived well, we never had a surfeit of anything. It was a somewhat hand-to-mouth existence, but we were happy. The only thing that occasionally grated was having to house-share. It would have been nice to have been able to afford a place of my own. We lived in Brighton, which is on the coast and has really superb fish due to our fish 

OMG, this question totally made me LOL. My family knows that since I was a weeeee little girl I have always been a picky eater. Let me explain. I’m not what I call an “Entitled picky eater”, meaning I don’t project my pickiness onto others nor do I expect anyone to accommodate my likes and dislikes. I more or less quietly do my own thing. Eleven yrs ago I was preggo and my son’s father is from the area so he had family here. I didn’t. During that summer almost every weekend his twin sister would have a birthday party for one of their niece’s and nephew’s kids and the whole family would come ove 

Oh, I think I have a good one! It's one of the pettiest, stupidest things I've seen a grown up do… so let's start from the beginning. I had my MIL come to three different family gatherings at my place and refuse to eat anything on the table. Two occasions were small gatherings with only me, my husband and daughters, my parents and my parents-in-law. Third one was my daughter's birthday, and I had more guests, who would later ask if my MIL is always this unpleasant and weird. Everyone who enjoyed the food was talking about how great it was, and there was really a lot to eat, lots of choices too  

That has only happened once, but with a new girlfriend of one of my husband’s marine buddies. She made funny faces and pushed her food around on the plate throughout dinner, just like an ill behaved toddler might, but once she expressed confusion about the shape of a roast, we realized she’d never eaten real food before. I don’t mean to toot my own horn, but I am not a bad cook. I practice meticulous kitchen hygiene, I read recipes, and I use quality ingredients, so at the very least my meals should come out as edible, and I think they’re a good bit beyond that. If the appetites it dinner guest 

My bachelor graduation was every chef’s nightmare and a financial disaster. Very memorable. I have five siblings, but for budgetary reasons I only invited my parents and grandparents and (now ex) boyfriend. See, I was extremely broke. I worked my way through university, but all my money was spent on housing (I lived alone) and study costs. My budget was a mere 80 euro per month for food. In my country €170/mo is the bare minimum for a healthy, varied diet. So, I was somehow surviving on half of that, and on the brink of being underweight. For my graduation dinner, I prepared a lovely pumpkin/carr 

Forty years ago, we had possession of the gigantic (much bigger than a bread box) chrome plated electric rotisserie that my in-laws had won playing bingo sometime in the mid 50’s. That behemoth made the absolute best chicken I’ve ever eaten in my life—moist tender meat, nearly black crackling crisp skin. (I’ve mourned its demise for decades.) So, when we invited our new neighbors over for supper, I knew roast chicken had to be the main dish. To accompany; steamed fresh broccoli, a tossed salad, and my husband’s fave, parslied potatoes (boiled new potatoes drowned in butter, salt, and fresh pars 

Unfortunately, I was that person - twice. First time, my first ex-husband and I went to his friend’s house for dinner. They lived on a farm in a very large, ramshackle house. I was pregnant at the time. This is important later. I sneezed, my eyes watered, I started itching and broke out in hives as soon as we walked into the house. Mom was re-potting plants in the living room. Although they had many acres of land and a huge yard, she was doing this inside the house. There was literally no where to sit because each couch and chair was full of stuff. Laundry. Mail. Shopping bags. Etc. Their young 

How would you handle an employee who refuses to attend company parties?
Actually, the last company I worked for before going solo had this kind of thing. I don’t mind party, but sometimes in the weekday I got pretty tired after a day handling complains and thinking my way out of buggy codes. So the company I worked for was a family-managed company. Every single year, the lady owner would celebrate her birthday… And it would the single nightmare for some of us. Her “birthday party” was not lavish, no, it was far from that. It was more likely an independence day celebration in Indonesia. You got to be picked up by your department for doing something (fun) but stupid. 

Speaking as an HR I can tell you that unless “attending corporate events" is written in the job description that the employee has signed and unless you pay it as overtime (because it's outside of regular working hours), you have no grounds whatsoever to force them to go or to “handle" anything or anyone. Speaking as an employee who never attends corporate events, I'll give you an example from my own experience of what can happen if you do force someone. I was compelled to attend a corporate Christmas ball once. Didn't end well. I'm an introvert and in my previous company my supervisor was an ext 

My reply to this is on why people do not want to attend company functions. Let me start with saying that many people have the attitude I do. It is a job and only that. I am paid for my experience, skills abilities and expertise in my chosen field (Telecommunications). I am paid for the time I am there and only that. After working with the same people all day long, some people want a break from the people they work with and would prefer to spend their free time (which can be quite limited) with friends and/or family. Also there are quite a few people (myself included) that are very selective with  

I had a discussion with some of my coworkers who were venting out their frustration over parties. Company parties are considered as a platform for employees to like each other. “66 percent of managers say showing up at the party is expected”,(PR Newswire). Its an unsaid rule that almost every employee feels liable to follow. Generally, company parties are hosted after work hours, which means they are voluntary. The main goal of the event is to help the employees, so why not give them a choice? In my opinion, there shouldn’t be a need to handle an employee who refuses to attend the parties.  Here a 

 The other answers are terrific. But they are also predictable. My company doesn’t own me.I have a life outside work.I want work-life balance.I work to live. Not live to work.blah blah blah yada yada yada Average workers are 100% predictable in their “populist” responses!  But consider this question from the perspective of a Boss: Top Performers = Excellent Work + Strong Motivation Average Performers = Excellent Work + Lukewarm Motivation Below Average = Poor Work + Strong Motivation Low Performers = Poor Work + Poor Motivation  Top 20% Performers do not need a Boss. They are self-starters. Just give them

Years ago now I was appointed general manager of a large automotive and general engineering works in the UK. It was a bit of a mess, riddled with trade union disputes, and barely struggling along with continual interference from its accountants and shareholders. As I had to I instituted reforms that initially didn't go down well at all. No more multiple trade unions -- only one union rep, but the unions could decide who that should be and seek my approval. If approved, that rep would sit in on works management meetings as the representative and voice of the workforce. No more of all the variou 

Okay, let’s assume that I’m at the top of the Org chart of my own company, and it is my decision on how to “handle” employees.  (Image credit: Shakhawat Shamim at Comfort Design; DesignCrowd) In this scenario, I have an employee that doesn’t want to attend company parties, even though they are paid for by the company. And I need to parse how to handle that eventuality, and how to address that employee going forward. So how would I handle it? I wouldn’t give a damn. Not a single fuck is given. My job as a CEO/Chairman is to build the most efficient company possible, and for it to be profitable follow 

Most people seem to be answering this with speculation as to why the employee may not be attending; I’m going to take a slightly different route with this answer. I am “one of those people” who generally refuse to attend company parties so will give a slightly different spin on the answer and it will be why I refuse to attend. In general I could be considered a very private person, I keep to myself and try not to bother other people. During my late teens and twenties I also struggled with agoraphobia and it took until my late twenties before I overcame it. I may come off as unsociable but it is 

Oh I just may be an expert on this. This explains why, the answer follows. As a kid I filled oxygen cylinders with a guy we will call Wallus. If Wallus was rolling a cylinder across the dock and the clock struck 5:00 he stopped right where he was, walked off the dock and went home. Night after night I’d end up cleaning up and locking the place up by myself. In no time I got sick of that and one evening when he froze at 5 I lit into him with “Hey A$$#@@% what makes you think I should clean up after you every night?” He never missed a beat. He said “You do that cause you’re young and stupid. We used 

Before I was doing ‘gig economy’ stuff, I was that employee who refused to attend company parties… or anything with the word ‘mandatory’ in it. Telling me I HAD to be somewhere, where I was expected to drink alcohol, eat food, and be in a room full of noisy people always got my hackles up. I don’t like alcohol. Other people’s food scares me. And rooms full of people are things that I avoid like the plague — you know plagues are contagious, right? You couldn’t pay me to attend a party. Matthew T. Waterhouse's answer to When a supervisor tells you a meeting is mandatory what do you do? I suggested t

Should I quit when my boss is refusing to approve vacation time for an important trip I planned?
You haven’t shared the reason your trip is important to you so I can’t speak directly to your situation, but I can share one of my own. Eleven years ago my mom died. In 2011 my dad planned a ten-day trip to Normandy, France for a D-Day event. He invited me to go with him and offered to pay my way. He wanted the company since mom was gone. My bosses denied my vacation request. They said I was “too indispensable” to be gone for that long unless/until they found more help in my department. Just a few months after that they essentially fired me. They didn’t actually fire me - I quit in anger (over th 

“Unless you're able to get out of that trip, we may have to go another direction as far as employment.” This was spoken to me by my brand-new boss, because two years ago, I was in this exact scenario. I'd recently begun training as a barista at a local drive-through coffee stand. In Washington, the birthplace of Starbucks, one can hardly go a mile without seeing one of these little stands, and I'd always thought they'd be great fun in which to work! Initially, I was absolutely right! The customers were fun to talk to, my co-workers were so sweet, and I really enjoyed creating all of those differe 

My husband and I recently moved. He gave his boss a month notice that he would be taking a 4 day weekend, as I have a nerve disorder and cant stand long or carry anything over 15 pounds. He reminded them at the 2 week mark after they approved it and they said as long as he could run any emergency loads, this obviously was an annoyance but he agreed. The next day we found out my aunt had passed away suddenly after get pneumonia while trying to get to her next cancer treatment. Her funeral was scheduled the 2nd day of his four day weekend and was across the state about a 4 hour drive. As soon as  

Here’s my story: I had worked as a pharmacy technician in a hospital. While I was being interviewed for the job, I told the interviewer that I would only be staying for two years because I had plans to go to college out of state. He said that was fine. We discussed how everyone is required to work one holiday a year because they have to have coverage and the only fair way to accomplish this task is if everyone did one holiday. Well, during the next year and a half, I worked EVERY holiday. They even asked me to stay one night because there was a blizzard going on outside and several people couldn 

So, I think you should approach this differently. Speak with your boss and/or higher up with regards to why your request was denied. Politely and kind. If it was denied because they are understaffed or there is some concern over time sensitive assignments. I would then ask if they would approve a set hours (eg: 4 hrs of OT) to get it done and ask if that would change the approval to vacation. However, if your inquiry request is dismissed than you may have to question if this job has its employees interest at heart. If that is the case, do understand that you are just another number. Most states a 

I worked on a project, 10 years ago, where I faced quite a similar situation. We were being made to work like prisoners, no rest, no recuperation, 8:30 AM to 1:00 AM in the night or more. For more than 7 months, we endured. Saturdays, Sundays, it was all fair game. Men, women, it didn’t matter. No-one left before 12:30 AM at night. We’d drop the girls off at their respective homes before shuffling off to our own, for a few measly hours of sleep. It was the peak of the recession period, and we were all worried new entrants to the IT market. It was not a good time to land on your ass, for no fault  

Whether you should quit or not depends on you. Your question doesn’t include backstory, so I’m going to assume that you believed you would receive approval and are now at a decision point because the boss said no. One question to ask yourself is if you can afford to lose this job or if you can afford to miss that trip. Here’s my story: I got a job at a Big Box at an entry level position. But I’m 50-something, I’ve been around the block, I didn’t ‘need’ the income but didn’t mind it, and for entry level retail work it had a fixed schedule 5am-9am M-F which is super unusual and convenient. [Note:  

Counter to the answers advising to sacrifice the vacation to plan an orderly exit later, here’s a similar scenario that played out differently. My company had decided to “not-deny-but-not-approve vacations &gt;2 weeks”, and my new manager - “Tim” - was the enforcer. Tim was useless btw - gross incompetence personified - a relevant detail. I had my delayed-for-6-months honeymoon coming up - 4 weeks RVing around the USA national parks - and nothing was going to stand in the way of that. I’d also been planning a risky career pivot, and had my first bite - but not a locked in gig yet. So I resigned to Tim 

This happened to me twice. Once was in 1979, when I was working at a University Hospital, in CCU/ICU. I had an extensive back ground in CCU, &amp; was ending up in ICU the majority of the time, which was NOT why I had accepted a job there. An opportunity to go on a scuba diving trip to Grand Cayman &amp; St. John, VI with a local Zoo teen volunteers group had made itself available. I gave several months notice, and had the time accrued. My head nurse came back with they did not approve any vacation leave that was more than 2 weeks long- this trip was 16 days. I told her that it was the opportunity of a  

Our honeymoon. Three weeks driving tour across the UK. My boss was cool with me being gone for three weeks. My soon to be wife, who worked for a national chain womens clothing store at the time, was told by her regional manager no way in hell. So she decides she will give notice. Great time in our lives for a change anyway. Tells her boss &amp; friend well in advance of the formal filing. More weeks pass. Were about three weeks from the wedding &amp; the trip, formal notice has been given. Nt long after, the regional managers *boss* stops by the store to ask my wife, who had been there for years, why sh

I took my car to Midas for a new muffler. Later they called to say my brakes needed machining and they could not release the car. Is this legal?
I just finished my associates in auto tech, and they covered situations like this specifically — at least for the state of Ohio — and what they are doing is NOT legal. The repair shop CANNOT hold your car and keep you from taking it even if they think the thing is going to blow up or throw a tire or run you straight into the telephone pole across the street. Holding your car against your wishes is theft, and a call to the cops will get it released to you right quick.* See, you have the right as a consumer to get a second opinion, and even if the car is not drivable (for whatever reason) the rig 

NEVER EVER DO BUSINESS WITH MIDAS, that franchise is all about ripping people off. When I was young and a bit stupid I took my wife’s car to Midas for a brake sale they were having, I couldn’t even do the brakes myself that cheap! So they did it without any problems and gave me a lifetime warranty on the pads. About 4 or 5 months later and about 5,000 miles later the brakes started to squeal so I took them back to Midas, they said that the brake pads wore out due to the all the wheel slave cylinders were frozen and the main master cylinder was shot, the total was going to be around $500, this w 

May I start by saying I worked at a well known Auto Center for 30 years. As a certified master mechanic I've seen it all. I've had situation where customer have been hearing brake noise for weeks but never found time to have their vehicle inspected. By the time they finally bring the vehicle to the shop, many occasions things would be so bad where once you finally able to remove the brake drum brake parts just began to fall to the ground and there has been metal to metal friction so long where springs,brackets and other parts are disfigured and distroyed. Now suppose that customer wants to get 

My experiences with Midas have not been good. And issues were not just restricted to one outlet. First time dates back to my student days - I took my car in to get the muffler replaced - they wouldn’t let me stand and watch while the mechanic checked out the rest of the exhaust system but they called me in a few minutes later to show me that pretty much the entire exhaust system needed replacing. When he pointed out the holes in the various components the edges all showed “shiny metal” - translation, they’d hit the thing hard enough to damage perfectly good components. I told him to put the car 

In 2004 I took my vehicle to the Midas in Chandler Arizona USA for a coolant flush. Came back from a movie, all of the wheels were off. They broke the locking lug nuts. They started with an attitude towards me. I had already called for a tow and the police before I walked in to collect my vehicle. They did not do the coolant flush. They said they could not release my vehicle as according to them the brakes were bad. The police told them they could be charged with Grand Theft Auto as it was being loaded onto the bed of a tow vehicle on dollies since the wheels were not attached. I let the insuran 

Excerpt from a very good article addressing this:Okay, we have established the fact the car is 100% unsafe. We also know that the customer is not fixing the car. What happens next? The Shop Attempts to Keep The Car What were to happen if a service station attempted to keep a car. I don’t think it would take very long for the situation to escalate. I am sure that law enforcement would get involved. Laws do very from state to state, but I could not find any state that said a service shop could keep a customer from there car. In fact I seemed to find the opposite. Shops can not get in the way of 

Nearly the exact same experience with Midas 30 years ago. Brakes squeeling while stopping. Took it to Midas. They put it up on their lift. Pulled off the tire. Pulled a gasket to the side to show me brake fluid. They tell me the brakes are severely damaged and leaking. The brakes are red hot, they are dangerous, it could fail at any moment. The car is dangerous to drive. I should have a replacement of the entire brake mechanism: replace everything, plus they should check all 4 brakes for the same problem. If they took the car down as it is, they would fear for my safety and would not be held l 

It depends on your state, or local laws. In some places they cannot release a vehicle to you directly to drive off their lot if they deem it a public safety hazard. Now you noted the brakes needed machining, and that would be the brake rotors, and not the mechanism itself. Uneven rotors can lead to excessive wear of the pads, but does not prevent the vehicle from safely stopping. If the rotors were in such a state to be unsafe to drive they would need to be replaced outright, not machined. Now they cannot refuse to release the vehicle to a tow truck that you pay for to get a second opinion, or  

Oh my, if I had time to tell all the stories I have heard about rip off franchise muffler shops. I use to own and manage a large auto repair/custom exhaust shop in a city with such franchises. So many customers that would call me for an estimate and it is amazing how much i could save them over the price gouging franchises. Like thousands on converters, muffler jobs, brakes, etc. Most of the time they didn’t need what they were told but what they did need, I could save them money. Hired one mechanic that had worked for them and he said they were yelled at all the time that they better sell sell, 

No , it most definitely is not legal . Although mechanics can be held liable if a vehicle that they worked on is in an accedent directly caused by a defect they caused or noted and failed to repair , all they have to do to release the car if the owner does not want the repair corrected is to have the vehicles owner sign a waiver that releases the mechanic and the shop of any responsibility in the case of an accedent . If you car is being held hostage by an unscrupulous repair shop , first call the police then report the repair shop to the better business bureau. To avoid this problem in the fi 

What caused you to fall out of love with your past lover?
I’m probably going to get a lot of heat for what I’m about to say, but here it is anyway. In today’s world. We get so consumed by our socio-economic statuses and gender inequality that we forget about the reality of biology and how human bodies actually work. Regardless of what people will say, men and women are not equal from a biological standpoint. This doesn’t mean that any one of the genders is better than the other, that’s just simply not true. We are just different. The way our bodies react to circumstances is different in its core. I agree that from a socio-economic standpoint, everyone 

When I first got married, we would be passionate everywhere, if you know what I mean, bed, floor, couch, where ever. We would do things for each other. And we enjoyed each other’s company. She was from Japan I am white american. I learned to speak Japanese and we lived in Japan a few years and life was good. We had kids together, but over the years things grew cold between us. They say that people change and you grow apart. I don’t think either of us changed. I doubt that most people change. What I suspected happened was that I would base my love on how much she loved me and visa versa. If she d 

Nothing, but at the same time, everything. I was with my ex for nine years, and for the last two of those years we were engaged. Engaged to be married? Nope. Engaged in a constant battle with each other. The seven years that led up to that point were amazing. I was bent out of shape from my previous relationship and he was there to heal me. He knew my worries, struggles and stresses but still thought the world of me. He made me feel beautiful when the whole world rejected me. (I'm not very attractive, never have been.) I lost my virginity to him, and even if he didn't lose his to me, he exclaime 

This is a story I never thought I would tell. The man I was set to marry before my current marriage turned out to be a maniac. We were together for four years and I loved almost every minute of it. He took me on expensive dates, we went on expensive holidays, and his family absolutely adored me. My mother adored him but my dad was always a bit suspicious of him and his intentions and told me to watch my back. My dad has always trusted his gut and it has never failed him, so this initially worried me. We started dating when I was around 21 and he proposed to me on my 23rd birthday. I reluctantly s 

I loved my ex-husband more than words can express. He was a passionate and intelligent, handsome and charming. He treated me well. Even our disagreements were mild. Two weeks before our wedding, he became angry with me. I don’t remember why. I don’t think it was over anything that was important or I’d remember. Anyway, he said horrific things about me while he was angry and broke my heart completely. I told my friends and family that I was calling off the wedding because I couldn’t marry a man who could be so cruel toward me. I was more hurt than I had ever been by anyone before. The things he  

I was married before to my daughter’s biological father. Things started out ok, but as the years passed, I learned that it wasn’t necessarily ME that he loved; it was more of a case that anyone could be me and married to him, and this became quite clear to me. That was what most of our fights were about towards the end. Gradually, with each passing day, more and more evidence came to light that he got this “job position” filled by whomever was willing to have sex with him at the time. I was a bit naïve and did not want to believe this about him. It got to a point where he had gone on a little  

I met my ex in the 9th grade, we became really close friends. Towards the end, I started falling for him and he hinted he liked me too. In the 10th grade, I asked him out and we dated for about a year. He was my best friend, and the one guy I truly loved. During junior year, I had to move to a different country, distance at first was not an issue but being a junior in high school balancing both work and a relationship was hard. He was really depressed that I moved in the beginning, months later, he started hanging out with guys who'd skip classes and smoke. And note, he was the type of guy who w 

The only person I truly 'fell out of love with' was my third girlfriend. I started dating her a few months after being devastatingly dumped by who I thought was 'the one' at that time in my life. She wasn't particularly attractive, or motivated, and she was a good candidate for a rebound relationship while I pinned for my ex. I know that sounds horrible, but I didn't realize I was doing that to her at the time (I realized it right before I split with her). She was funny and we enjoyed a lot of the same things…namley video games, drinking, and smoking weed. I was 22 at the time, she was twenty.  

He was my best friend. He was my first best friend. I never had a best friend in my life till then. I prefered staying alone , reading books , studying for exams , winning competition. I always got 1st rank in class . Head Girl of school . Basically a nerd . He was everything I wanted in friend . I eventually started falling in love with him . And then there was my friend ( girl ) .They two were the only friends in my life then. I never really wanted to tell him that I loved him because I was too scared and of course I did not want to ruin our friendship. Eventually my friend started pressuring  

I guess love is not always being together or getting married, sometime it means happiness of the other person even if you are not there to share with them. Let’s start a story….. Long back a cute love story emerge from a little crush of a girl on a boy. After a long and tiresome waiting when they were in a relationship the boy made some promises in disguise that he will offer everything that she lack in past several years, like fatherly love, freedom to enjoy the world, support to fulfill her dreams and lead a happy prosperous life. As time passes, as she enjoy her freedom some part of her tries 

Why does Harry never fall in love with Hermione?
Harry and Hermione are not suited to each other romantically. This is the biggest reason that this ship could never work, and so called fans who push for it are ignoring just how badly Hermione makes Harry feel ESPECIALLY when he is going through very personal and emotional things. ✦ Harry CAN’T confide in Hermione, But Confides in Others✦ Harry needs someone in his life who will listen to him and empathize with him, and Hermione… Is not that type of person! He can’t trust her his emotional problems, so WHY would a marriage ever work out between them? Hermione acts impatiently to Harry’s feelings 

As they say, the heart has its reasons. Personally, I like the stories where the main male character ends up with the main female character at the end, but in Harry Potter I think it's good that they do not end up together for several reasons: WARNING: all that is my point of view on the characters or the work itself.

Did you ever fall in love in a war zone/deployment?
Yes.  With this young girl right here. I met her in a small village on the outskirts of Marjah, Afghanistan. I can honestly say that this little girl made me who I am today. So we were out on patrol, you know the usual…       You know, what humans normally do, burn stuff, try to get the radio to work, and do your damnedest to make it look cool. Well it was about a quarter of the way through the patrol. I was walking along, looking around. Hating myself. Hating the desert. Hating people. Hating the sun. Hating Afghanistan. And hating Afghans. I was at a point in my life then when I would have gladly let th 

it's more than war actually. Here in Egypt, there’s 50% Muslim, 45% Christian, 5% other. But Muslims does dominant the country even in laws. Any Muslim male can marry a Christian female even if her family didn't accept this. but they got married anyways. but a Christian male can't marry a Muslim female even if she loves him. He will just get his ass threw in the jail for lifetime and his family will destroyed and burned by the law and his nighbourhood Muslim people. Last year, I had relationship with a Muslim girl. I just loved her so much that I take a risk for her, even if I'm gonna die in t 

My stories are not nearly as noble or romantic as some of the other answers. I met a stripper in Texas. Absolutely stunning gal, dead ringer for porn star Savanna Samson. To take it up just a notch, when I met her, her mother was also stripping in the same club. I asked her out and she said yes. I spent the last 4 days we were in port there with her. I talked to her about her dreams. She wanted to be a Dental Hygienist. Well I told her that the Navy has a great program for Dental Techs. We parted ways but I came back a year later for another visit. Went to the strip club, I didn’t find her but  

A2A. Close and yes, in two very different ways. My “baby-san” in my unit area - a woman I paid a very small amount to wash my uniforms and mind my hootch - was a physically beautiful, soft-spoken young woman who rarely spoke, about age 22. I never put a hand on her, unlike what I later understood was a common approach. She could easily have made ten times more ‘P hooking. But she was honorable. I later found out that she had already been widowed twice, and had two children. One of the most haunting photos of the hundreds I took in country was of her, in 1968, wearing that cone hat, with those e 

Yes, i'm sure it happens very often. It did to me in 1966, when I was in the Navy, and our ship pulled into Hong Kong, itself a very alluring and seductive place to a seventeen year old. While having some suits custom made (the cost back then was $25.00 apiece) at a tailor shop, a cute little girl named Hoi Poi Poi, peeked from around a curtain and even though the proprietors (her legal guardians as she was an orphan) discouraged us, I was smitten! I saw her the next time our ship was back in Hong Kong. Then I volunteered to stay in Viet Nam the next time our ship anchored off the coast near Da 

We met during training. It was a month long, we flirted a little but there was no free time to get together. Once training wound down and we had just a few days left, we went to see a movie. After, we went up to my hotel room. Never thought we’d see each other again. Skip to a month into my deployment to Iraq.

Why yes. Yes I have, and I’m still very much in love to this very day. Have you ever had a buttcrack full of sweat? Has the part of the world you were in at the time been so dirty, that even the air itself is dirty? Well, if you mix dirt, and buttcrack sweat together, you get mudbutt. Mudbutt becomes sandpaper between your cheeks. On a long patrol, that sandpaper does a fine job of destroying your skin, and your will to live. When you get back to your shack, with a raw bottom, life gets even better, when the only place you can go is a 130° porta-potty, swarming with POO flies that like to land 

Yes. Their were a number of complications. But, after a lot of effort, the beautiful teen-aged Vietnamese girl, Bac and I were able to marry.

Yes, in Vietnam. I met a girl working for the Red Cross there. I was an infantry platoon leader. We fell in love and got married when we both came back to the states. I then went to flight school and went back to Vietnam without her because she was then pregnant with our first son. We are still married 48 years later. 4.4K views · View upvotes2052Christopher Aeneadas, Founder and Chairman at Equality for the Ragr Group, InternationalAnswered 3 years ago · Author has 6.5K answers and 11.8M answer views

Not I. It does happen though. Generally it is only a problem if one partner is in the others chain of command, or if there is a substantial rank difference. The practice of generals diddling junior enlisted is frowned on, regardless of whether flowers are involved. The great warning to be given is that lovers often get married, and the military isn't great about stationing married pairs together. You'll only get that partner's comfort and attention on the deployment you meet on. After that you are likely to conduct your relationship via phones and letters. 6K views · View upvotes · Answer requested by Abdullah Zubair Khan17Sophia-Helene Mees de Tricht, If I had a nickel for every weird relationship I've had, I'd quit this job.Answered 3 years ago · Author has 5.8K answers and 27.9M answer views

What makes a man fall in love with a woman?
What country have you fallen in love with because of their cuisine and food?
Sorry I have no picture of it but Indonesia has for my opinion the most astonishing way to eat and one amongst the most delicious local food I ever had. Preamble: I was there for business reasons and at lunch time I was asked by the Indonesian guy who acted as my guide, translator and host if I would go in a hotel near to have food, as normally they do with people coming from outside, definitely: International cuisine! I gently refused and I asked for an Indonesian restaurant; he was not so decided and he proposed to go anyway in an international hotel near where there were Indonesian dishes too 

I grew up in a country that brought together multiple destinations and global citizens under one roof. Yes, I’m talking about the United Arab Emirates. Through that lens, I have fallen in love with the middle east because of its cuisine. Food with aromas and flavours that transform your senses yet leave you feeling balanced and whole. Let’s take a look at some of these dishes: The notoriously irresistible Shawarma  Vetically slow-roasted chicken shredded out and stuffed into a wood-oven baked Khubus along with garlic paste, pickled vegetables, and french fries. The chicken is marinated in a varie 

I have three contestants: China, France, and Turkey. I wrote a Quora Answer about Chinese and French food. In case you haven’t checked it out, here it the link: Steven Lee's answer to You have to eat three countries’ cuisine for the rest of your life. What are they?

South Korea That every third restaurant you come across in India will be Chinese, or at least have "Chinese" cuisine on their menu, is a given. Suffice to say this butchered Indian version of Chinese food, with cornstarch and ajinomoto (MSG) as the leads, is no where close to the authentic recipes. In my search to find decent Chinese food, I came across the cuisine of another neighbouring country which turned out to be absolutely drool-worthy. I have fallen in and out of love with a bunch of cuisines over time but South Korean takes the cake. The basic tenets of South Korean cuisine is to keep it 

Bangladesh ! Bangladesh ! Bangladesh ! Bangladesh ! Bangladesh Great to get an opportunity to share about foods as I am a foodie by born. I love spicy foods a lot.

Cuisine, no. Food, yes. New Zealand’s eggs and dairy products are just…other-worldly. Probably because they don’t do factory farms like we do in the US, the animals must be fed vastly higher quality food. I have literally NEVER seen such dark orange egg yolks. The flavor was amazing, rich and creamy. The family who produced them had their picture on the carton. I am a bit of an egg snob and pay a premium for what I consider are the best eggs in my grocery but these eggs put them to shame. Same with dairy products. The cream cheese has none of those nasty stabilizers that we use in the US. Funny  

For me it was backward: I feel in love with Japanese food because I loved Japan. More specifically, because I discovered that Japanese food reflects Japan’s culture and values. Simplicity. Have you ever seen a Japanese tea room? It has practically nothing in it.  In terms of food, especially with the luxurious type, you can’t get simpler as this:   Attention to presentation/visuals. Origami, ikebana, hanami, yes Japanese care about beauty. Food is no exception:    Seriousness and focus on experience. In this shop, there’s no background music. Why? Because the sound of tempura being fried is the background  

That would be one of my favourite countries in the world: Polska🇵🇱.  So I went there in 2016 for the history, I went to Krakow so see the city and visit Auschwitz. I eventually came across a food tour. It wasn't expensive so me and my friends did it, and honestly it was one of the best days in my life. In western Europe we often think of southern Europe as having the best food in the continent. And although I love Spanish, Italian, Greek and Turkish food Polish food may be my new favourite food in the continent. Zurek is my absolute favourite.

INDIA! When I was living in Australia, I had a roommate from India, and I could always smell the delicious curries in the room. Around that time I started to know Indian cuisine and always went to Indian restaurants with friends.

I literally liked every Indian dish I tasted, personally prefer those spicy ones. I like various kinds of spices. so Indian food is just my type. But I've never been to India (sadly), I usually go to those restaurants operated

Have you ever fallen in love with someone while traveling? What happened afterwards?
About two months ago i was travelling around Europe for a month. About two weeks before the trip i was able to message a Swedish girl i worked with two years back. I agreed to have her show me around Stockholm since it would be good to have a swede show me around. I was also quite arrogant that I could sleep with her since i remembered here as this girl whom was abit socially awkward and therefore quite easy to approach. On my first day in Stockholm we caught up over dinner and reminisced. However near the end of the night as i was working on bringing back to my hotel room I find out from her t 

In April 2014, I had just finished my master’s degree, broken up with my boyfriend, gotten over a bunch of family issues, and I had no idea what the next step was. All I knew was that I needed to get away because I didn’t want to live in Paris anymore. I had worked for a few month, so I had some money in the bank, and my parents were still waiting for me to tell them what I wanted for my last birthday and Christmas present. So I bought a plane ticket. One of the flexible ones that allow you to take various flights all over the world under certain conditions. I went to a camping store with my fat 

Hi, this happened to me. It changed my life! I’m Australian and I went on a short 2 week holiday by myself right before I started my PhD. The first day of my holiday I signed up for a 3-day tour of a national park in Australia. I started talking to this cute Swiss guy on the tour and we basically spent the next 3 days talking, we had a great connection. We then spent 2 more days together after the tour before I flew to Singapore and he traveled south. After we said goodbye I immediately had a strong feeling of regret. Why didn't I just stay and travel with him? Anyway I went to Singapore/Malaysi 

This.  Not right away, of course. I’d been living in Beijing, China for about 6 years and was about to say goodbye to the best friend I’ve ever known at the end of summer. To celebrate the end of an era together, we decided to travel down through China on the train and loop around through Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand before returning to Beijing and saying our goodbyes. Checking into our Hanoi hostel, I couldn’t help but overhear an extremely loud American man grilling an employee about various Vietnamese cookery lesson options. My friend and I shared a very British raised eyebrow at the racket  

I have. It was the summer of 2015. I spent the whole summer working as a cashier in a general store in Yellowstone National Park, the best summer ever. Like a month after I started working, this new Ukrainian girl showed up, she was about to be my partner in the store’s espresso bar so I was supposed to show her how everything was done there. We were the same age so in the day to day we spent a lot of time together and we became really close. I really liked her. One day after work we were in my dorm hanging out and from the nowhere we started kissing (thanks God my roommates were working at the  

Answering this question in Anonymous will not reveal any names/age. I was travelling to Australia from Bangalore. I met a handsome guy (let's name him A) at the airport we chatted for some soon realised he too is traveling in the same airlines. When it was time to get on the flight I got up dusted my red pleated midi skirt and went to the bus which took us to the flight when I went and sat in my chair A who i met in the airport came at sat next to me smiled at me I also smilied back. I had the window seat which I like to sit whenever I travel. Soon the flight took off A started to chat with me w 

Not exactly fallen in love but it was really great experience, she was 6 years younger than me. I liked her.. her company.. those travelling hours were best so far.. Going anonymous because I don't want anyone to know about this  So I was going to travel to Ahmedabad from Vadodara in GSRTC Volvo. It was last Volvo for the day. I was standing near the bus as there were 15 minutes were remaining for departure. One girl passed in front of me, I noticed her. Not anything special, just a normal glance at her which we frequently do at public places. I didn't think much about her. I did notice that she b 

I worked in Singapore for 2 yrs in my early 20′'s and decided to take the long way Ferry ride back to my hometown in Davao, Philippines when I met my late husband (1st mariage--father of my beautiful children) on my way home after my contract ended…I wasn't looking to hook up with anyone….never had a boyfriend or any serious flings before. I was 20 and he was barely 19 when we met on the ship. Coming home after 2 yrs working in a foreign country probably feels like coming home from a 1st tour if you're in the military. I was young and my family couldn't afford college…plus, I was up for a real  

Yup! There's been 3 on my travels who I thought, “oh my god this girl is awesome, I could see myself with her.” I lived in Liverpool, England. I travelled constantly for work so really could live anywhere, within reason. One of these girls (and my favourite) lived in Australia. She was amazing. Ridiculously hot, had 2 degrees and was an amazing musician. And she really liked me. I half considered moving to australia. Work came first so I didn't bother. One was in Sweden. She was absolutely awesome. The most fun girl I've ever met. I considered moving to Sweden, but I thought it would be too expens 

Yes, somewhat sadly. When I was living in Sofia I came across what I can only describe as the most beautiful person on Tinder, I saw their pictures and worried that they might not like me back, I had recently ran out of Super Likes, so I needed an effective way of catching their attention. In super stalker mode I notice that they had their Instagram linked to their profile, so I went to Instagram and slid into their DMs with a “hey”. This person didn’t seem startled at all, we sent messages back and forth before finally asking me how I had found them, and why I was texting, and this is when I wen 

What country have you fallen in love with because of their cuisine and food?
Sorry I have no picture of it but Indonesia has for my opinion the most astonishing way to eat and one amongst the most delicious local food I ever had. Preamble: I was there for business reasons and at lunch time I was asked by the Indonesian guy who acted as my guide, translator and host if I would go in a hotel near to have food, as normally they do with people coming from outside, definitely: International cuisine! I gently refused and I asked for an Indonesian restaurant; he was not so decided and he proposed to go anyway in an international hotel near where there were Indonesian dishes too 

I grew up in a country that brought together multiple destinations and global citizens under one roof. Yes, I’m talking about the United Arab Emirates. Through that lens, I have fallen in love with the middle east because of its cuisine. Food with aromas and flavours that transform your senses yet leave you feeling balanced and whole. Let’s take a look at some of these dishes: The notoriously irresistible Shawarma  Vetically slow-roasted chicken shredded out and stuffed into a wood-oven baked Khubus along with garlic paste, pickled vegetables, and french fries. The chicken is marinated in a varie 

I have three contestants: China, France, and Turkey. I wrote a Quora Answer about Chinese and French food. In case you haven’t checked it out, here it the link: Steven Lee's answer to You have to eat three countries’ cuisine for the rest of your life. What are they? Some pictures of fancy Chinese food:  King Crab  Fried Scallops  Dim Sum  Sesame Balls  Fried Noodles  Peking Duck But of course there are staple food like the following:  Pan-fried Pork Buns  Potstickers/Gyoza (Actually originated from China)  Xiao Long Bao (Soup Dumplings)  Beijing Zha Jiang Mian Then there are meats:  Hong Shao Rou (Roasted Pork Belly)  Ho 

South Korea That every third restaurant you come across in India will be Chinese, or at least have "Chinese" cuisine on their menu, is a given. Suffice to say this butchered Indian version of Chinese food, with cornstarch and ajinomoto (MSG) as the leads, is no where close to the authentic recipes. In my search to find decent Chinese food, I came across the cuisine of another neighbouring country which turned out to be absolutely drool-worthy. I have fallen in and out of love with a bunch of cuisines over time but South Korean takes the cake. The basic tenets of South Korean cuisine is to keep it 

Bangladesh ! Bangladesh ! Bangladesh ! Bangladesh ! Bangladesh Great to get an opportunity to share about foods as I am a foodie by born. I love spicy foods a lot. For getting the different taste of food you have to visit in Bangladesh. Just let me show you why it is perfect place for you. Street Food of Old Dhaka These are widely known to Bangladeshis as heaven of Food. You can get any kind of succulent foods on there. Even you will see a lot of foreigners are also visit there for getting the taste. Biriyani (Chicken/ Beef/ Mutton) Biriyani is the premier rice item to everyone in the country. Yo

Cuisine, no. Food, yes. New Zealand’s eggs and dairy products are just…other-worldly. Probably because they don’t do factory farms like we do in the US, the animals must be fed vastly higher quality food. I have literally NEVER seen such dark orange egg yolks. The flavor was amazing, rich and creamy. The family who produced them had their picture on the carton. I am a bit of an egg snob and pay a premium for what I consider are the best eggs in my grocery but these eggs put them to shame. Same with dairy products. The cream cheese has none of those nasty stabilizers that we use in the US. Funny  

For me it was backward: I feel in love with Japanese food because I loved Japan. More specifically, because I discovered that Japanese food reflects Japan’s culture and values. Simplicity. Have you ever seen a Japanese tea room? It has practically nothing in it.  In terms of food, especially with the luxurious type, you can’t get simpler as this:   Attention to presentation/visuals. Origami, ikebana, hanami, yes Japanese care about beauty. Food is no exception:    Seriousness and focus on experience. In this shop, there’s no background music. Why? Because the sound of tempura being fried is the background  

That would be one of my favourite countries in the world: Polska🇵🇱.  So I went there in 2016 for the history, I went to Krakow so see the city and visit Auschwitz. I eventually came across a food tour. It wasn't expensive so me and my friends did it, and honestly it was one of the best days in my life. In western Europe we often think of southern Europe as having the best food in the continent. And although I love Spanish, Italian, Greek and Turkish food Polish food may be my new favourite food in the continent. Zurek is my absolute favourite.  Over time I have come to love the Polish people, hist 

INDIA! When I was living in Australia, I had a roommate from India, and I could always smell the delicious curries in the room. Around that time I started to know Indian cuisine and always went to Indian restaurants with friends. I remember my first time eating samosa, I just loved it so much that I actually tried to make them on my own. But it was a bit difficult to make.  I literally liked every Indian dish I tasted, personally prefer those spicy ones. I like various kinds of spices. so Indian food is just my type. But I've never been to India (sadly), I usually go to those restaurants operated  

India. India. India. I’ve been to India twice now: June 2018 and November 2018. One fact: I FELL IN LOVE WITH INDIAN FOOD. This is one of my favorite. Just fell in love with it the first time I tried it in June 2018. &lt;3 Matar/choley - kulchey (in Karol Bagh, New Delhi)  Golgappe / Pani Poori  Dhokla  Bhel Poori  Paraantha with Aaloo sabzi along with Poha (yellow) and pickle (in Paharganj, New Delhi)  Paraantha with curd and pickle (in Goa)  Poori aaloo (in Goa)  Kulfi (Jaamun a.k.a.

I cheated and she forgave me. I love her so much, but she doesn't look at me like she did before. She loves me but is not in love. What should I do?
First off, you need to understand this.. She didnt forgive you. No one can forgive a betrayal like that. People use the wrong words and so that leads to a false sense of the situation. She has maybe got past, dealt with, moved on, accepted. If you start to use the right words, it might help you to cope better. Second, she doesn't look at you the same. Why or even how could she? The look she gave you before was earned by a man who loved her so much that he would never hurt her. She was everything to him &amp; was all his heart needed and wanted. This man respected her feelings, her hopes, her fears. 

Im gonna go against the grain here because there are a lot of one sided answers here, “if you loved her you wouldnt have cheated”, “you should gave taken what she has given you and be content with it”, etc. Im a female, in case anyone wants to come at me for going against feminist mentality. So here it goes. Yes you cheated and she decided to stay. We dont know your circumstances, so for anyone else making assumptions as if she’s this angel is quite ignorant and comical. My father cheated on my mom and probably still does. She stayed and she resented it. Growing up, the narrative was always that  

I don’t know you or her, so take this with a grain of salt, but here’s what I would guess. What you’re seeing is not necessarily specifically about the act itself. Many people (myself included) have been in and enjoyed relationships that did not exclude sexuality outside of the central couple. It’s not the sex that broke things. What is happening, I think, is that you and your partner are having deeply personal and emotional thoughts that don’t include one another. She is wondering, “Was it because I wasn’t good enough for you? Are you trying to find somebody to replace me? Why did you promise I  

This may be a different perspective than many, but I'm answering from her side. From the side of having been cheated on, and having forgiven. The thing is, people tend to expect much more than is humanly possible from a significant other. They expect them to "just know" what we want, think, or need, without having been told. We expect others, especially a significant one, to think the same way we do, and have the same views, but news flash: THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE. As flawed human creatures, we make mistakes, often daily. It is absolutely ridiculous to expect another human to be perfect, or more prec 

Honestly, I don't think you are going to like this answer. But if you love her so much, than you need to set her free. Free to be loved, completely by someone who knows her worth from the get go and will never betray her love or her trust. Cheating is a huge betrayal and has such an impact on a person's life. Being cheated on, makes you wonder what is so wrong with yourself that you aren't good enough for someone to be faithful to. You lose your self-worth, your confidence, essentially you feel broken. She cares for you, but also hates you and sometimes trust can never be put back together onc 

I am going to take your word that she indeed forgave you and stayed in the relationship. I’m also going to take your word that you are remorseful and do love her very much. And your challenge now is that she is no longer in love with you but still loves you, meaning, the passion is missing. This is because she is still in pain, the wound is still there. And this is what you need to heal. You need to spend more than double the effort to show her, prove to her, convince her that you are not going to stray anymore, and that the second chance is worth it. You need to build that trust back up to the 

What have you done so far? What steps have you taken to make her feel safe in your relationship? What steps have been taken to rebuild trust? What reassurance does she have that it will not re-occur? You’re far more likely to repeat the pattern now. She has to decide whether the investment is worth the risk. Whether you are worth the risk, you have already proven that you are not a good bet. Have you sought counselling from those who specialise in Infidelity? Are you accountable to someone? What led up to your cheating, why did you cheat? Have you fully disclosed and answered any questions she 

—(First—the shit-slinging you’re getting is ludicrous IM NOT GONNA THROW DUNG, cuz you’re reaching out in earnest and I respect that. HOWEVER—I’m going to be hard on you because you asked the right question, ✅ which means you want to hear this straight up, no fluff. And specifically you want to know what actions to take because you can’t go back. Right? Okay. What should you do? Yes. BEST QUESTION—You recognize something is wrong. Bonus. You obviously haven’t done shit from then till now to make her look at you differently. Probably because you thought you know what to do by now, but you don’t.  

Be patient. Relationships are different for everyone, depending on the people involved: Not everyone that is cheated on can forgive the cheater and not everyone that is cheated on hurts forever. If you can show her that you are trustworthy and honest, it could win back her trust and love. You may need to be VERY open about everything, to the point of checking in when you're out of town and her having access to your emails/texts. Maybe the two of you need to go to couples counseling so you can both work it out. But there might always be that little bit of doubt about your honesty, depending on  

Consider yourself a blessed man. That said, you broke your covenant with your wife by sleeping with someone else. Spiritually speaking there may still be a breach. Somewhere along in your marriage, you may have forgotten what love, covenant, and marriage were. Saying sorry, and receiving her forgiveness is one thing. Making the necessary internal changes to prevent this from happening again is entirely something else.  If it were me, this is what I would do: 1) Make 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 Your Mission Statement – At every wedding that I have attended, this is one of the many passages that is read.  

I told my therapist that I loved him and he hard-swallowed right after. What do you think this could mean?
Ask your therapist. Only he knows. And ignore any “not good” catastrophizing or “you shouldn’t behave like that” shaming. If you don’t feel safe enough to proclaim your love in therapy, where else would you? Here’s the other hard thing about asking your therapist: He will respond. And high chances it will not be, “I did this one gesture/response/motion because I am, in fact, in love with you too.” That also makes it hard to ask your therapist because as long as you ask others and not your therapist, you can still have the fantasy. When I asked my therapist when I would stop being attracted to him 

Hey there! That was really vulnerable for you. I am a licensed Clinical psychologist (PhD) and I’ve had patients express those feelings for me too. It tends to be a hard statement for psychologists to answer. This is not because we don’t care about our patients, but because we are bound by several ethical mandates. 1) Beneficence and non-malevolence (do no harm): You are correct. No one knows you more than your therapist. But, with that, comes vulnerability and we must not exploit your vulnerability. Even if he felt he loved you too, it would be wrong to take advantage of you by responding in  

Unfortunately, this most likely means your professional relationship needs to come to an end. The ‘hard swallow’ could mean a number of things, both conscious and unconscious thoughts, but the moment you told him that you’re in love with him, you put him immediately in a very delicate situation — he could literally lose his liscence by starting a relationship with you, all of those years of schooling and work could be shattered. If you truly feel you’re in love with your therapist, you should step out of the professional relationship. Thank him for his time, tell him that you’ve appreciated eve 

My question is what did YOU mean when you told him that? Did you mean romantically and if so, was that unambiguously conveyed to him? If the answer you are hoping to hear is “It’s probably because he’s in love with you too” you can fugettaboutit. I haven’t met one clinician willing to risk their license to even start THINKING about a patient in that way. Your odds are better that he probably was thinking “Oh no…” (As in “oh no, not a case of transference”… Personally, I’ve been there (on the therapist side of things, albeit as a volunteer one time that a man was showing strong and clear signs o 

Transference is a condition in which you have developed trust in your therapist and you feel vulnerable with them, and then you transfer feelings from childhood persons onto your therapist that make you believe you are in love with your therapist. This is a common situation which should have been anticipated by a professional and dealt with Before it went too far. Your therapist, in a sense, has messed up and allowed a tricky situation to get out of control. He may not have experience with this, which would make him panic… hence the deep swallowing. You may find - if he Is a professional - tha 

You should also realize that you are going to read into the situation as MUCH as possible. Had he blinked, you’d notice that. Had his left hand clenched, you would have noticed that. He could easily have gulped because he’s now in a tricky situation. Falling in love with your therapist is COMMON. It is because of the trust relationship and because it’s probably one of the few people that you open up FULLY to. That creates vulnerability and trust. I’m not saying your feelings aren’t true, I’m saying that most everyone will feel that way in that situation. So your love might be a facade as well. Th 

Something very similar happened to me too. I’m a female, and the therapist was male. I couldn’t utter the words because I was so embarrassed, and I’m also married actually. So I struggled with these feelings for quite some time, before finally deciding to be honest and open up to him. I wrote him a poem, instead of telling him directly. When he read it, he looked gulped a few times. Then, while sitting on his chair facing me, he lowered his head towards the floor. He then looked up. Momentarily he looked like he had seen a ghost or something - he looked absolutely horrified, but then quickly resu 

He was thinking. Thinking of how hard life would be when he no longer is able to practice his profession if he gets involved with you. In the medical world, that is one of the biggest no-no's you could do. Firstly, you're vulnerable and at your most naked point when you're in therapy. You tell this person everything (if it's being utilized as intended) and they give you support during these periods. If he took your love and manifested it into something “more” you could sue him later if things went left. He would definitely get suspended, disbarred, and cars would be flying before he ever got r 

As a therapist, we are trained to understand that our non-divided attention, unconditional acceptance, understanding and empathy towards our patients/clients is bound to be compared to the less exclusive, more conflicted relationships they have in life. We are never to forget this is a one-sided relationship, a safe place where the patient can tell us everything about themselves but we don’t actually share anything about ourselves, except our expertise and our ability to help them with their emotional needs and challenges. It can create the illusion that we are their perfect match, giving this  

That he likely didn’t expect this message and was considering the best way to respond without crossing ethical and legal boundaries, but also helping you to feel safe in the counseling environment. It can be a tough call for a therapist. What did he do or say after that? It is actually a normal goal of therapy called “transference” where the patient gets to a place of safety and trust with their counselor so that they can resolve unfinished business in the safety of that “soft place to fall”. Depending on his training and therapeutic orientation he may be more or less able to balance this news. I 

My girlfriend slept with another man and now she said she is confused and that she loves him but still loves me so much. What should I do?
Long read : Worth it. Buddy, let's be a little human here. There are already 81 answers out there giving you moral lessons. But we are humans, ain't we? If it was that easy, you would not be here asking this question. Lets look at your question and analyse things. Your girlfriend slept with another man. Now we all know it wasn't any innocent sleep. So that already tells us that she broke your trust.Now she may be sorry, say it was just a one time mistake, she won't do it again, yada yada. But do you smoke? I don't, but yeah, you must know how many of the smokers started by ‘just one time, just to 

This is going to sound very harsh, but it might make you think of it from another point of view: How much did she love you when she was having sex with the other man? Was she thinking of you whilst having him inside her body? It’s like she wants her cake and eat it. The time for her to sort out her confusion should have been before she jumped in bed with him! Obviously I know nothing of you, but I’m sure deep down you know that you deserve much better than to be treated like this! Everybody does. How long are you will to wait for her to make her mind up? A day, a week, a month, years? You need to 

If you love someone, let them go. Personally, I feel infidelity is a dealbreaker for any commited relationship. On the other hand, you’re not married. Have you ever discussed the terms of your relationship? Did you ever promise to be exclusive to each other? If not, it may be your gf has done nothing wrong. Talk about it with her and listen carefully to her. Make sure you both understand what each of you needs in this relationship. Is exclusivity on the table, or are you both free to take other lovers? How would you feel about seeing other people? How does she feel about you seeing someone else?  

My girlfriend slept with another man and now she said she is confused and that she loves him but still loves me so much. What should I do? Decide if you want to continue your relationship with your girlfriend. What she has done and feels is pretty common. Hell happens to men all the time. I’d be surprised if you don’t have a number of male friends that have been in similar situations. Love isn’t limited to one person. The reality is we have a huge capacity to love others, even multiple people in a romantic way, at the same time. What you have to decide is how you want to go forward. This might in 

My girlfriend slept with another man and now she said she is confused and that she loves his but still loves me so much, what should do? Break up with her and don’t look back. People show you who they are through actions. She cheated on you. She also feels like she loves this other guy and you. She’s being selfish and cruel to you, and you’re being a pushover who lets her. Suck up that insecurity and do something to better your situation. At best, you are on an equal playing field for her attention as this other guy. In reality, you are miles behind. She was already with you, broke your trust and 

SCREEEEEEW THAT!! No, no, no. No. The time for confusion and uncertainty was BEFORE she sat on a strange penis. There shouldn’t be any doubt now. Too effing late for that to work out. Are you married? Do you have kids? If not, it should be obvious to you that she toasted any future the two of you may have had together. Know what else? YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS ALREADY. You’re asking this question because the weak part of you that likes the way she gives you orgasms is willing to overlook the transgression, and that weak part of you can be quite loud… Sometimes loud enough to drown out the strong part o 

Is that the kind of of love you want? The kind where your girlfriend makes conscious choices to get into situations that she knows will hurt you, and then cries about how “confused” she is? *waiting……* No, I didn't think so. This is classic cheater tactics. Do something royally selfish, then play the struggling victim. “Oh golly gee willickers, I'm so confused! Please pity me through these hard times. See me to my fainting couch!” “Love” is more than about a feeling. Anyone can say they love you. But proclaiming your love for someone is empty words when thier actions do not reflect thier convictio 

Contrary to pretty much everyone else here I wouldn’t necessarily advise ending the relationship. It bodes well that she is being honest with you about her feelings for him. If she were purely “cheating”, why would she do this? Perhaps, instead, she is learning. (You do not say how old you are, or how long your relationship has existed, or how you found out she slept with someone else.) I have been on your girlfriend’s side of this. I consider myself a naturally polyamorous person but I have chosen to live a monogamous life so that I can be with my now wife. I am eternally grateful that she stuc 

I feel somehow small to write this answer since i am not yet married. However, when my gf (gf at that time) married my very close friend, its just like wow wow wow, nice. As if like the earth is burning up with ice. I later bagan to thoroughly think what is faithfulness, love, trust, lust. Yes, cheatings are painful. She must be faithful as much as you are faithful to her.Then, no cheatings, no argument, if then, it can be rectified if there is faithfulness and trust. There must be trust between the two.If there is no trust, faith can not spring. In many case, love alone may be lust. Trust is real 

I say you should tell her to be with the other man. I’ve been through this plenty times before and everytime I tell my boyfriend to go be with the other person. even if she does choose you over him she’ll always have that “what if I would’ve chose the other one?” ESPECIALLY when y’all are into it or not a good place in yalls relationship. She’s in a hard place right now. I say leave for the betterment of YOURSELF. You may also start to think she is cheating with him if she’s not at home or hanging with friends. If it’s meant to be it will be. If you leave her I’m sad to say she will go to the ot 

If I can't explain why I love the person, is it love?
There could be several reasons you can’t explain your love. It could be that you’re inexperienced, and don’t know where to start. It’s possible this is limerence, that crush feeling fueled by hormones and excitement. This is the love of lust. It’s probable that you’re looking to outline your love with feelings. Feelings are changeable, and often difficult to describe. Feelings are fleeting. I’m sure you’ve been in situations where you’ve experienced multiple feelings in an extremely short amount of time. An example of this would be incredulity, followed by insult, then anger, then laughter at the 

I think if you can’t explain why you love a person, it’s more likely to be love. Since the dawn of time humanity has been trying to explain love, and while scientists can now talk of hormones and synapses it is still something we cannot properly describe to someone who has not experienced it. We come into the world unable to comprehend anything rationally, but yet still we are feeling, experiencing and in an abstract way thinking. We can to an extent explain consciousness in scientific terms, but we cannot explain awareness. That is to say, we cannot explain what is experiencing our consciousnes 

I asked her : Do you love me ? She : Nope. (with a smile on her face) Me : You know I'm serious. She : Okay okay. Sorry. Now ask. Me : Do you love me ? She : of course i love you. Me : why ? She : What why ? Me : Reason. Say some reasons why you love me. She : hmmm ….. you are cute. Me : okay ??? She : you are a good guy. Me : okay ? She : you too loves me. Me : Noo. Say something serious what made you fall for me. She : okay. Now listen. The main reason why i love you the most is i gave birth you, you are my son. What can be the better reason ? That lines with heavy philosophy were not entered in a 10 years  

A friend asked a guy: “Why do you love your girlfriend so much?” “She is the most beautiful woman in the whole world. Also she is so kind to poor people and animals, I have never known a woman like her. ” He replied with a big broad smile on his face. 5 years later. The same friend: “Brother, how can you guys get divorced when she is so beautiful and kind?” The guy replied: “Brother over years, I realised that a person is not about one particular trait, I still love her looks and kindness but rest in every other field, we are incompatible and carry contradictory views to each other. Not even a day 

I slept for a very long while today. It was one of those surprise slumbers that pull you away at 1pm and suddenly you find yourself awake at bedtime. As annoyed as I was about how illogical, untimely, and inexplicable this was, I know I had a wonderful dream. And I don’t remember even a tiny second of this dream. All I know is that it has left me feeling weightless, happy, peaceful, safe, and loved. Now do I need the details of what happened in the dream to feel this way ? Maybe, but I don’t have access to them. All I have access to is how I am feeling right now. And I love it. It is luscious. Som 

It may still be love. Why we can’t tell is because of the limitation of our cognitive abilities. Okay, let’s take an example. Let me tell you why I love a certain type of chocolate. Hmmmmm…. Sorry I can’t tell. But there’s no doubt that I love that chocolate. Because I want to eat it all the time. I infact eat it whenever I can get a hand on it. So, there. I love that particular chocolate, but can’t tell why. (Maybe it’s because it’s linked with a pleasant phase of my childhood.) So, we may still love someone, without knowing the reason. Though we have to find those reasons soon enough. We have to know 

“Dad, what do you love the most about mom?” “The way she gets mad at me.” Can you be convinced with this statement? Even I wasn't. But they love. They love each other the way they are. It has no questions and answers involved.  “Mom, what do you love the most about Dad?” “He's mine isn't this enough?” Can you be convinced with this statement? But, I'm.  My dad makes sure that he never do things which offends her, intentionally. Mom knows him well than what he knows himself. Two completely opposite personalities yet holding that fragile thread so intently that nothing can break it. They can't explain me wh 

I absolutely LOVE this question and it may be my very favorite question that has ever existed. I have had people ask me “why do you love him?” and my answer is short and sweet…”I just do.” I don’t know, it doesn’t matter, I don’t have a list of reasons why and I wouldn’t want that. When I see someone listing the reasons they love their spouse it seems so artificial. Its as if they are building a case so as to justify what they believe to be love and probably is not. Love is unexplainable and it is supposed to be and be happy that you don’t know. Its that mystery that makes LOVE the best feeling  

There was an utter easiness which I felt that day. There was run of emotions with a fast heartbeat which was getting faster every second. A question shattered my heart... Probably just a word “Why? “. I had no words... to answer and I lost him. Love is more of an emotion and more than that it's a feel of new life. Your love isn't explanatory until your actions are... Your care and your genuine moral is enough for the other person to realise. You don't need to explain until your actions are playing their part to make the person realise “What they matter to you".

Love always happens at a place that is beyond our ability to fully comprehend. So I would say that if you CAN explain why you love someone, you are probably misleading yourself. Love is infinite, and it defies any simple explanations. Love is a force that brings us together in coordination, so that we might bridge the infinite gap that separates two limitless souls. If you love, and you know you love, then you only need to open yourself to experiencing confirmation, seeking explanation may yield little fruit. 4.9K views · View upvotes11Sapan Kumar Jha, Accountant at Private Companies (2019-present)Answered 1 year ago

I want to experiment with other girls but I still love my girlfriend, what do I do?
I'm genuinely in love with Taehyung of BTS, is there any way I can at least make my feelings reach him?
I’m 29 and fell in love with a 19 year old, is this okay or should I not pursue a relationship due to age?
You're about 1.5 times older than this person. Think about how much happened to you in the last ten years. How much you learned and grew as a person. Now think about how much you didn't know about the world and yourself when you were ten years younger. For the fun of it, think about whether you'd pursue a relationship with someone 1.5 times your age. Would you be comfortable with being with someone who was 43? A relationship with someone at that age isn't illegal. It's barely legal, but it is (in most countries, to my knowledge). However, you risk damaging this young person greatly. I know, you  

I’ve tried this before. I’ve been around a lot of women in the past. And age does matter. I was the guy in his late twenties and doing a long distance kind of dating experience with a girl 10 years younger just out of her teens. This girl had gone through some bad times of her own. Not everyone comes from the same background. You see some girls especially at that age will idealize a new partner too quickly. She might have behavior issues with sex or drugs or alcohol and you’re passed that phase in your life. You’ve got more experience and wisdom than she does, she might not be as secure in her 

The 19 year old is just out of high school.. You are 10 years senior and if not finished University and starting a career, you have hopefully been employed gainfully since you left high school and hopefully have some job seniority and possibly a career ahead of you. The 19 year old has probably yet to experience a romantic relationship on an adult level.. The high school experience is all this person really knows. The mind is still not fully developed yet, there are crucial years of maturing and learning about real adult life and how to cope with it ahead. All of this can only be truly learned  

It’s possibly a bit late for an answer to the original questioner, but hopefully someone else will read this and it may help them It can work, but it will be a real test of your commitment to each other at times and sometimes for quite extended periods. I wish I had known 20 years go what I know now - yes we got through it as a team, and came out the other end but there were some very rocky bits in the middle. You are just going to see the same matters in completely different ways because of the difference in experience and through different values that often change with different stages of life 

I am older than my wife by more than that, but I can tell you, right or wrong the chemistry between us is far too great for me to have said no to her when she was 19. And yes, I would have chased her when I was 19, even if she had been 35. I believe that if the Love is powerful enough and the chemistry is deep, that you, as a “seasoned” adult, and desperately in Love, have the power to NOT do harm to this girl, though most men in general only care about one thing, whether 19 or 49. Pathetic. Still, if you are truly in Love it could work. I mean, from what I have seen, anyone’s odds of a great  

I’m married to someone seven years youger than me (so we would have been 28/21 when we married and 26/19 when we got engaged). The answer is the age gap doesn’t matter a stuff as long as its an appropriate relationship, by which I mean you see each other as equals and she’s not eye candy or just good in bed, that sort of thing. If she is a more mature 19 year old and you like the same sorts of things, then run with it. Nineteen year olds range in maturity from 25 down to about three. There can be problems (is not recognising Suzi Quatro grounds for divorce ….) but as you get older it will matter  

It should be pointed out that this age differential between males and females used to be quite common. That is pretty close to what the case was with my own grandparents. It used to be that it would take some time for a man to get established in his work and to save enough money to offer his bride a respectable home. It was also not common for women to pursue education past high school, and the expectation was that they would get married fairly young. Obviously that was then, and it isn’t now. Women, in particular, must come to grips with the reality that either their marriage might not last or 

Well I should take it slow. Never say never but in my experience a 19 year old is not mature enough ( there are some that are but… most of them aren’t) for a 29 year old. If you move too quick with a younger partner, especially with a 10 year difference, you will in all likelihood get dumped when she is 24 or even younger. Seen it way too many times happen. You say you have fallen in love but does she feel the same way? Because if she is not, mosey down the road, just saying. 5.3K views · View upvotes10Linda Porter, Therapist and Author writing books to help peopleAnswered 4 years ago · Author has 10.3K answers and 4.9M answer views

I'm not sure whether you are actually together yet and whether you are asking if you should pursue what has already started. If this is the case then the relationship is there and plenty of people have age gaps of more than this. A friend of mine married at 19 and he was 18 years older. They were married for nearly 50 years. If you have not started a relationship yet- 19 is plenty old enough to start one. If she doesn't want to pursue one with you she will soon let you know. 9.8K views · View upvotes · Answer requested by Devin Guill9Andrea RiveraAnswered October 7, 2020

My ex was 10 years older than me. I was 19 and he was 29. Fast forward: this was an instant attraction that ended in disaster. I loved him and he loved me. We lasted 4 years and ended up having a daughter out of it. I learned that it’s best to date someone your age or close to your age range.Older men want a young beautiful woman to groom and then manipulate: if that’s not the case, it’s because mentally they aren’t mature enough to date women their age because no one will put up with that shit. 1.1K views · View upvotes51Ceasar Rodriques, L.A. -Engineer/PoetAnswered 4 years ago · Author has 122 answers and 376.6K answer views

My ex-girlfriend got married two weeks ago. I have seen the video of her wedding. She looked  so excited, and very comfortable in the marriage. Do women easily forget six years of love in six months?
My wife won't forgive me for my mistakes. She claims she doesn't love me nor never will again. How do I give her the space and time she needs?
When I married my wife, I was deeply in love with her. I recently had very intense feelings for another woman that makes me question whether I have ever loved my wife. How is that possible?
My girlfriend loves me a lot, but she cheated on me. She doesn't want me to leave her and we are in love. What should I do?
I do not think there is anybody that can tell you what to do. This is ultimately your choice and a decision you have to live with. But I want to help you think through some things to consider before you make a decision and give you my experience. A lot of times people can cheat even if they love the other person. Sometimes the reason why they cheat is not because of how they feel about you, but more of how they feel about themselves. Sometimes it is because they feel alone in the relationship. Sometimes it is because of a lapse in judgment. Whatever the reason, it is important to be open and li 

The most profound thing you said in that question is "we are in love".  On the surface it's easy to say "Just dump her!" or make the assumed judgement that "she cheated, she doesn't really love you!"...and in many cases those ARE great answers!  But not all.   People do things...not always good things...and we assume that it's a reflection on us, our value, our worth.  Sometimes it's a reflection that the person doing it has some issues and it's REALLY nothing personal about us.  Don't ever use that as a justification to settle, make excuses or allow behaviors that hurt you, though.  It doesn't n 

She loves you right? Then what makes her cheat you? I mean I don’t think there’s any reason of her cheating on you when you BOTH ARE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER, because when two people are in love they never think about anyone else because the other person is their whole world, their peaceful place is their partners arms. So I don’t think that she’s in love with you. But that doesn’t mean that I'm right! Also there might be chances that she loves you a lot but probably was getting attention more from the other side. We girls love attention (hard to accept for me as well and many more but that’s tr 

Cheating Girlfriend! She Cheated On Me But I Still Love Her. What To Do?  I really feel for you, discovering you’ve got a cheating girlfriend. I imagine your stomach feels like it just got ripped clean out. I should know. My girlfriend cheated on me too (an ex did) so I know exactly what you’re going through. It’s a truly horrible situation to be in. The thing is, it’s already happened. She already did it. There’s no escaping or hiding from that fact. And that’s why now, you’re going to need a plan for how to proceed from here. Because currently, I guess your head is all over the place and you’re  

It’s very simple. If the person you are with cannot commit to you, violated the sanctity of your commitment, partnership and love, disrespected you, and broke your trust, what exactly is left of the relationship? If you’re telling yourself it won’t happen again because you love her, then you’re lying to yourself. I was cheated on and had my heart broken so believe me I know what I’m talking about. At the beginning I was unbelievably angry but then when I thought of losing her I tried to convince myself I’d get over it or it wouldn’t happen again. If she truly loved you she would NEVER cheat. N 

I have walked this path as my ex-wife committed adultery. Here is what I believe. The first thing you must do is take care of yourself. Find a support group or a qualified counselor To discuss your emotions. You can’t go this alone. Exercise or do whatever you historically enjoy. Many people will say there are two sides to every story or what role did you play in her cheating. Please do not entertain either of those thoughts. The fact is, there are not two sides to every story. Do we tell a child who was abused that we first must get the other side of the story from the abuser? Of course not. T 

There is no forgiveness for a cheating woman, period. You should want to keep your man status than be cheated on again. Once a man forgives a cheating woman she will walk over him as a human being. She becomes the boss and you the subordinate. You lose your authority in the relationship if you are okay with sharing vagina with other males. Any woman can find dicks to ride as easy as she can breathe. This makes the rules different from men. This doesn't mean men should cheat. No one should cheat but a woman has a vagina and can cheat 3 to 4 times more than any man can. Any man allegedly FORGIVIN 

Dude, she cheated on you. that is not love. You are just too scared or lazy to look for someone new. I am pretty sure she does not love you since she cheated on you assuming she did it without your knowledge so she wanted to do it so badly that she did not want you to know about it so it is obviously not love there on her part. You may love her but she does not love you no matter what she says from that point on, there will always be that fact. So no matter how much you love her (since we established she does not love you as she got laid with another person behind your back) you have still a fe 

There’s a bit of cognitive disonance in your first sentence. If she loved you, she would not have violated the prime directive. To be cheated on is _the_ most egregious form of betrayal. It’s not something you do to people you love. Even if one were apathetic to someone else they would not be as overtly hurtful as to cheat on them. I would call upon an old addage, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.” Trust is earned and this person has demonstrated they aren’t able to handle such an awesome responsibility. That said, it’s your life. I would invite you to take a _very_ _deep_ look at your feelings 

Cheating is absolutely toxic in any committed relationship. As Billy Joel sings it, this is a matter of trust. Anyone who cheats was unable to trust themselves. Will your girlfriend ever get back to the point where her feelings for you automatically trump all choices to cheat again? (And there will be times when she'll have to choose.) Virtue is only virtue if it's been tested (another song there), and your girlfriend has fallen off the virtue bandwagon. Unfortunately for you, she'll be the only one who will truly know her virtue from now on. If you can live with this, don't let her go! But if y 

I told my therapist that I loved him and he hard-swallowed right after. What do you think this could mean?
Ask your therapist. Only he knows. And ignore any “not good” catastrophizing or “you shouldn’t behave like that” shaming. If you don’t feel safe enough to proclaim your love in therapy, where else would you? Here’s the other hard thing about asking your therapist: He will respond. And high chances it will not be, “I did this one gesture/response/motion because I am, in fact, in love with you too.” That also makes it hard to ask your therapist because as long as you ask others and not your therapist, you can still have the fantasy. When I asked my therapist when I would stop being attracted to him 

Hey there! That was really vulnerable for you. I am a licensed Clinical psychologist (PhD) and I’ve had patients express those feelings for me too. It tends to be a hard statement for psychologists to answer. This is not because we don’t care about our patients, but because we are bound by several ethical mandates. 1) Beneficence and non-malevolence (do no harm): You are correct. No one knows you more than your therapist. But, with that, comes vulnerability and we must not exploit your vulnerability. Even if he felt he loved you too, it would be wrong to take advantage of you by responding in  

Unfortunately, this most likely means your professional relationship needs to come to an end. The ‘hard swallow’ could mean a number of things, both conscious and unconscious thoughts, but the moment you told him that you’re in love with him, you put him immediately in a very delicate situation — he could literally lose his liscence by starting a relationship with you, all of those years of schooling and work could be shattered. If you truly feel you’re in love with your therapist, you should step out of the professional relationship. Thank him for his time, tell him that you’ve appreciated eve 

My question is what did YOU mean when you told him that? Did you mean romantically and if so, was that unambiguously conveyed to him? If the answer you are hoping to hear is “It’s probably because he’s in love with you too” you can fugettaboutit. I haven’t met one clinician willing to risk their license to even start THINKING about a patient in that way. Your odds are better that he probably was thinking “Oh no…” (As in “oh no, not a case of transference”… Personally, I’ve been there (on the therapist side of things, albeit as a volunteer one time that a man was showing strong and clear signs o 

Transference is a condition in which you have developed trust in your therapist and you feel vulnerable with them, and then you transfer feelings from childhood persons onto your therapist that make you believe you are in love with your therapist. This is a common situation which should have been anticipated by a professional and dealt with Before it went too far. Your therapist, in a sense, has messed up and allowed a tricky situation to get out of control. He may not have experience with this, which would make him panic… hence the deep swallowing. You may find - if he Is a professional - tha 

You should also realize that you are going to read into the situation as MUCH as possible. Had he blinked, you’d notice that. Had his left hand clenched, you would have noticed that. He could easily have gulped because he’s now in a tricky situation. Falling in love with your therapist is COMMON. It is because of the trust relationship and because it’s probably one of the few people that you open up FULLY to. That creates vulnerability and trust. I’m not saying your feelings aren’t true, I’m saying that most everyone will feel that way in that situation. So your love might be a facade as well. Th 

Something very similar happened to me too. I’m a female, and the therapist was male. I couldn’t utter the words because I was so embarrassed, and I’m also married actually. So I struggled with these feelings for quite some time, before finally deciding to be honest and open up to him. I wrote him a poem, instead of telling him directly. When he read it, he looked gulped a few times. Then, while sitting on his chair facing me, he lowered his head towards the floor. He then looked up. Momentarily he looked like he had seen a ghost or something - he looked absolutely horrified, but then quickly resu 

He was thinking. Thinking of how hard life would be when he no longer is able to practice his profession if he gets involved with you. In the medical world, that is one of the biggest no-no's you could do. Firstly, you're vulnerable and at your most naked point when you're in therapy. You tell this person everything (if it's being utilized as intended) and they give you support during these periods. If he took your love and manifested it into something “more” you could sue him later if things went left. He would definitely get suspended, disbarred, and cars would be flying before he ever got r 

As a therapist, we are trained to understand that our non-divided attention, unconditional acceptance, understanding and empathy towards our patients/clients is bound to be compared to the less exclusive, more conflicted relationships they have in life. We are never to forget this is a one-sided relationship, a safe place where the patient can tell us everything about themselves but we don’t actually share anything about ourselves, except our expertise and our ability to help them with their emotional needs and challenges. It can create the illusion that we are their perfect match, giving this  

That he likely didn’t expect this message and was considering the best way to respond without crossing ethical and legal boundaries, but also helping you to feel safe in the counseling environment. It can be a tough call for a therapist. What did he do or say after that? It is actually a normal goal of therapy called “transference” where the patient gets to a place of safety and trust with their counselor so that they can resolve unfinished business in the safety of that “soft place to fall”. Depending on his training and therapeutic orientation he may be more or less able to balance this news. I

The major problem is that she was in a one year relationship with my brother before me. It is a very long and complicated story, but basically I was in love with her when I was 15 and said so to her the spring before I turned 16. We kissed and I proclaimed that I had not been so happy for a long time, but then she turned strange and said that she was afraid to lose me as a friend if we became lovers and said we shouldn’t date,

I know that what I am asking is completely unfair, illogical, I used to laugh at people who raised question about girlfriend’s virginity, and now this issue struck me out of sudden.

You are not thinking, you are just replaying the events in your head and almost always stop at a particular point. You should indeed stop stopping at that particular point and actually think and finish that thought. You were not with her when the past happened. You heard a version of her past, most likely from her and you form a certain imagination of her past that you keep playing in your head. Perhaps there is some point in that past you wish didn’t happen to her, but it did happen. When we replay some one’s past in our head, we usually get stuck at that one point we think shouldn’t have happ 

You don’t specify what part of her past bothers you. I will guess your problem concerns her past sexual history. If so, this is probably a heterosexual relationship. And you as a male don't like the idea of your lady having this kind of experience. I’m not saying this cannot happen within a homosexual relationship, but it is more of an issue with a man dating a sexually active woman. Therefore, I am going with the odds based on the limited information given. If I am correct in my assumption, then I would ask: why is it not acceptable for a woman to be as sexually active as a man? And what is your 

I'll go out on a limb here, and assume it's about her past relationships or her sexual past - or the very fact that she has a sexual past. Perhaps it would help to think logically about this. It is unreasonable to expect a current partner to not have had relationships before you. This would require illogical and non-existent mechanisms. I know a lot of guys get insecure in this situation -which dominates the reality of relationships- but I don't get why. It's normal that she had a life before you.

There are several unknown details in your question. First: We don't know how long you and your boyfriend have been in a relationship. From what you are writing, it must have been long enough for you to decide that you would like to marry this guy. But your boyfriend says he wants to marry when "his friends get married" and you "think that might be about 5 years later". THAT is another unknown -it seems- because you "think" but you don't KNOW. How about finding out exactly WHICH of his friends is he actually talking about and WHO of his friends really want to marry in the next future and WHEN. 

It seems the priority in your life is getting married. Go on!! You can get married with a person, raise his babies &amp; all the while keep loving him (your boyfriend) for the rest of your life, or you can wait for him while doing wonderful things, exploring yourself, enjoying adventurous trips, shopping (yayy!!) or who knows persuing your dreams &amp; getting your prince finally knelt down for the rest of your life.

It sounds to me like both of you need to sit down and have an honest discussion about marriage.  Making a committment to spend the rest of your life with a person is not about your parents. They don't have to live with the decision, or this person, every day...you do. You should tell them, respectfully, that it is your decision and you will choose when you get married. Same goes for your boyfriend. "I want to get married when my friends do" or "I want to get married in 5 years" are stalling tactics. Chances are, he is not ready for marriage, and has no idea when he'll be ready, but he is afraid  

It depends on how important it is for you to get married - don't think of what society expects of you, but think of what you want for you. Are you bothered about the marriage aspect much? If you are, tell him that you don't want games from him and want him to tell you if he really intends on marrying you. If he doesn't, and you feel like you're losing a chance to marry someone else, then walk away.  On the other hand, if you're not bothered about the age in which you get married, then just let your relationship go on normally.  I got into a relationship with someone who is about 5 years yo 

He will have developed cognitively by the age of 25, so he is wise not to rush into a life long commitment when he is still maturing. This is frustrating for you but it would be foolish to push someone into something they are not ready for. He would likely rebel and say later that he wasn't ready for it all, anyway. And you might have a child by then. If you are meant to be together, then be together, but you have to love him enough to fully understand where he is at mentally. That's unconditional love.

Ummmm…who cares what your parents want in this situation. You're 29 years old. Do whatever you want. Your boyfriend, however, does not want to get married.

Do you really want to wait around for god knows how long for this guy who is feeding you a line of bullshit? Do you want children? How long are you willing to wait?

My boyfriend left me suddenly without having a fight or giving me any reason. I still love him. What should I do?
I am cheating on my husband and enjoying it, but I still love him. What do I do?
Q. I am cheating on my husband and enjoying it, but I still love him? What do I do? There are four parts to my answer: . Part I, Part II, Part III, and Part IV. Part I: . Use Your Imagination… Imagine that you are a man in what you thought was a happy, loving, faithful marriage.Imagine that every day your wife tells you how much she loves you.Imagine that one day, a trusted, always credible, friend of yours tells you that your wife is having an affair with another man, and enjoying it immensely.Imagine that the next day, your wife tells you once again how much she loves you.Would you believe her 

Well nobody knows how your husband would or will react. In my case when I proposed to my wife almost 11 years ago she flat out told me the only way she could marry me even though she loved me was that she could continue seeing other men. Well being crazy in live I said okay. Well 6 months later we married in Vegas in a small chapel. She picked my best man and her best friend was her bridesmaid. That day she had her bridesmaid dress me in a frilly maids outfit, leather collar and a 6 foot leash. My bride to be wore leather as did the best man. At the chapel the bridesmaid lead me to the entranc 

Sweetheart, even though I don't agree with your cheating at all, there's no point for me to throw mud at you, because I don't like mud fights. I will advice you like you're my friend. First of all, someone called you evil and mischievous and I would say that I don't know you, so I won't put a label on you. I will say though that cheating, the sin itself, the mistake itself is evil and mischievous. The fact that you feel good by doing that is wrong as well therefore evil because you are also conscious of that. But my dear child, I pity you. You are in trouble with your own mind and soul and whene 

Wow, some of you are real pieces of shit. I believe that this is one medium to which my wife is cheating on me. I tell you what, I would love to shake your hands personally. Male and female alike. You can have no idea of what and how bad things can turn out. I have lost my children, job, home, and about to be my freedom. Anyone involved in that will have hell to pay. Either in this life or the next. The one thing that I have not lost is my unwavering stance on fighting for the truth. Just like I told my Love, I will not stop. you can talk to ME, or can watch as the world burns around me. Somet 

If you love your husband, he really needs to know what you’ve been doing so that he can take proper precautions to protect his own health. Even if you’re practicing safe sex, there are STDs You Can Get While Wearing A Condom. The physical world works a certain way, and there’s no getting around that. Diseases don’t care about what humans feel or any of what humans might consider to be more “meaningful” matters, but they can make humans miserable if the humans ignore the physical world. So, if you love him, you will help him protect his health even if he leaves you and regardless of the “meanin 

Many married men or women like to cheat on their spouses, most men do that, when they are on business trips or doing anything with young women hanging around them, extra-marital affairs are unavoidable. They usually keep the tryst as a secret without telling their spouse. I don’t have a statistics to show you how many married couples have cheated at least once in their lifetime, but I know for sure more than a half of them have done so as a hobby or pastime. They still love their husbands or wives. They always treat that as a personal enjoyment to satisfy their secret sexual desire without dis 

WOW, this is very hard to understand. If ou love your husband you will ever do what you’re doing. cheating is the wrong answer for crying for attention or love behind your spouse back. You don’t hurt the one you love by doing things will break them. You cheated on him because you are done with him you know that deep down , because love is kind and beautiful it das not hurt. I guess you’re right now afraid where to go from here. Make sure that the man you are cheating with he’s the one you are leaving your husband for and your life will be better than what you have right now with you husband beca 

Apparently whatever you want. You having fun right now, and don’t want it to end. that’s all good for now. But remember you could be putting yourself at risk. I’m not talking about getting prego or an STD. Even though that is bad. I’m talking about not really knowing the person your cheating with. He seems like a good guy that's why your f..king him. But let us say you get tired of him and hook up with another guy. But the first guy says no you won’t. He’s willing to cheat with you. But feels like you are cheating on him now, and he don’t like that. How bad can this guy f..k up your world righ 

Figure out why excactly your cheating, what are you are not getting from your husband? I would not tell your husband your cheating. It could be very painful for him to Learn that, and he may never recover. Having stepped across this line, your pain should be your own. Have a serious, sincere discussion with your husband. Tell him you love him very much. You want to strengthen your bond. Tell him the reasons you love him. How you need more intimacy. Then listen closely. See how he feels, what he says. If his needs are being met. Also If he really can be what you need. And, are you what he really  

Ok so why do you call it love when your living a lie. My answer or assumption would be your husband makes really good money and doenst satisfy you sexually. And the man your seeing is pounding you the way you want. And the love for your husband would be based on what you would lose if he found out . So just make it very easy and safe DIY. Go buy yourself a massive dildo toy etc. And when your husband walks in and sees this massive toy your passed out on from over exhaustion. Im kinda certain that he will just take some time to think about bring that fire back to the intamacy. You can at the ve 

What types of people are the real life version of clickbait in the dating world?
Have you ever come across a Tinder bio that made you cringe?
No a bio, but one of Tinder’s own initiatives made me feel a little sick. Tinder Menprovement   Most men are good. But then there are douchebags who ruin it for everyone. So the women of Tinder are on a mission to make calling them out easy and fun. Together with the gallant men of Tinder, we created Tinder reactions so you can give instant feedback - Both positive as well as constructive - to those who need it most. Here’s what I think Tinder was trying to do - Actually help women to tackle douchebags on the app. Because not responding / left swiping was just not enough.Empower women on tinder by g

A2A “Have you ever come across a Tinder bio that made you cringe?” Way too many to really keep track of. Examples? This is going to make me wildly unpopular. But as a straight male, these make me cringe.  Look, more power to you for embracing your feminine soul or anything else you may attribute it to. I don’t stand in the way of want you want, but it isn’t going to stop me from cringing when I see it on the dating app. It’s just a truth of preference. I am sure the right man is out there for you and you are searching, again, all the power to you. This about what makes me cringe and nothing to do wi 

Goodness, yes. I can recall a few, but some definitely stood out and a couple I actually had to get a screen shot to show my friend because they were just…ugh. Also, I later saw this guy in person (NOT an arranged meeting, he just happened to come into my place of employment at the time) and he had most definitely used pictures that portrayed him at only his best angles-none of which I was able to find when looking at him (it took me a moment to realize why he looked familiar). I knew it was the same guy due to some distinctive jewelery.  It's NOT okay to omit apostrophes. This just screams “tota 

Bragging About Mental Illness  I’m not even going to go into the way this offends mentally ill people, because honestly I don’t care about that. What I am going to do is tell you that if a woman ADMITS to having a mental disorder and brags about it, then you should fucking run. Do you really think she isn’t going to take it out on you? I assume most people who seek out Tinder dates are doing so because they want to avoid toxic or unhappy relationships. So why fall right back down the rabbit-hole? Cringe Bio Or Cringe Person?  This girl is my age, and she’s already looking to settle. Never mind the fa 

When I got divorced and decided to try dating apps and being totally clues about all of them, someone recommended tinder. So I'm like okay bet, let me try it. So after maybe an hour after joing the site I git a message from a guy who wanted to go iut with me. Just looking at the picture I knew something was creepy about him. He was really cute but he had that american psycho look about him. Long story longer, I look at his profile bust out how dude was a kinky and in to S and M being dominated and stuff. He wanted to have someone put him on a leash and walk him like a dog, ccause he was a bad b 

19/20 – 39/40 Tinder profiles made me cringe. When I was active on Tinder I actively lost more and more hope in humanity. The absolute majority of female (as in meaning both girls and women, not as in 'me caveman, must call women female, ugg!') profiles were very cringy. I tried to decipher the Tinder culture. Was I expected to be this cringy and embarassing too? Is this how people present themselves in the dating scene in general these days? Should someone mix enormous amounts of botuline toxin in all water supply world wide? Should I start dating dudes instead since almost all these people seem 

Tinder recently added a feature that let users include videos to their profiles. They look like Boomerangs from Instagram. They may be the same thing. Basically, they’re short videos that loop and have no sound. Here is a Boomerang I recently took while at a football game. &nbsp;0:00-0:30 Example of a Boomerang So, you can include those on profiles now. I haven’t seen many, but one stuck out to me. The profile was a guy who obviously liked working out, perhaps a bit too much. His bio included something about the gym, even though his photos made it too obvious. Anyway, his video was of him in underwear grabbing his  

I do have screenshots of these, but I think I'll spare these lovely ladies of the public humiliation. First pic is of her flipping the bird to Trump Tower — bio contained “#AntiFa” - well I can already predict our first conversation.“Lets get together and pray to Daddy Corbyn” — support him or not, Daddy fetishising him might be a little bit far.“Swipe left if you're a tory” — BECAUSE I REFUSE TO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH MEAge-18, Bio: “Full time mummy of three” — This definitely bodes well for the future“Not looking for another fuckboy” — At least we know you're a good decision maker.“

Does OkCupid count too? The following is a screenshot from a guy who gave me a “like”, which I was able to see cause I'm too curious to not pay for that feature.  I don't mind if you have preferences, and everyone has certain standards. That's totally fine! But the above requirements sound like he's looking for some kind of fairytale. What's worse, that guy had the typical super boring bio (“I like food and traveling”), and appeared to not be objectively attractive from his badly taken pictures (I tend to differentiate between “attractive to me” and “not attractive to me, but likely to others”). S 

I’ve seen my fair share of cringy Tinder bios from women: ‘looking for a daddy’, ‘meth wiz’, ‘in town for two days, down for anyone without STDs’, just to name a few. I’m hoping that last one is a joke… But, without fail, I have to say the worst time reading bios was when a female friend let me look in on her Tinder experience. My God, men, what the hell are we doing? No dumb joke or trashy ‘I want a sugar daddy’ post could make me cringe as much as the stuff I saw on regular blokes’ profiles. ‘My annual salary is higher than your IQ, girl.’ ‘If you can’t deal with a man who loves his car more t 

Is Tinder a place for creeps?
I think it depends on where you are. I am a man. I live in Japan and got on tinder after breakup with my wife about a year ago. Majority of the women on tinder seem to be there for “pure” reasons. All say no ONS / Hookups on their profile. 99.9% say no married men, please swipe left. I clearly wrote that I am technically married but estranged. I do not get a lot of matches, but more than I can keep up with in terms of replying, and all of them said no married men, but seem to somehow ignore the fact that I am married. I met a few of them in person, they were not creeps. They were mostly just look 

I just spotted this and wanted to share my story. I’ll set the scene; It’s May 2017, your gal is currently struggling to make rent payments on a tiny room in Oxford, despite working a minimum of 50 hours a week managing a busy pub. Surrounded by wonderful friends, of course, but still drowning in a big, ol’, nasty puddle of disappointment. My boyfriend of almost 4 years had disappeared back to his home country, with almost no warning signs. And I mean we’re talking here one week, not here the next. I was almost 27, him almost 30, we had talked about our future. Maybe it was silly of me to think  

I had my first #metoo moment through someone I met on Tinder. It was horrible. The guys first of all had edited his pics, I think used a filter, it made him look 10 times better than in real life. He asked me on text messaging if I want to get into anything, I said we’ll see how it goes, but at that point I wasn’t keen and all I wanted was to meet someone new, have company for coffee as I was in a new city. We met for coffee. Turns out he’s very right wing and I’m extremely liberal. Had a semi-heated argument over politics. He said come to my place, it’s nearby, I resisted but like an idiot went 

I’m going to say “No” to this question. And here’s why: I have used Tinder in the past, and I don’t think I’m creepy….or I’m in denial…. In fact, I met a wonderful man on Tinder. It’s 2016 and I had just gotten out of rehab for an opioid addiction, which is a whole other story. Me and my then husband had filed for divorce in the past and had not been close, much less friendly to each other, in some years. The final straw was when he told me, the night before rehab (he had been smoking crack), that he wished I was going to jail instead of rehab. He knew I was serious about getting clean and knew I 

Tinder is a place for creeps the same way as any real-life circumstance involving a large gathering of people is a place for creeps. You’ll find a large sample of people from the most shy to the dick pic sending type. On a crowded subway or in a crowded mall you’ll likely find the same people you’d find on Tinder. I find it hilarious that people have prejudice against Tinder while hoping to meet a mate in a bar/party spot or randomly on the street. I’ve talked to a lot of women on Tinder and had some moderate success while not being a chad. As a guy, you gotta filter out the ones who are just s 

Unfortunately Tinder is a place for everyone. Guys who wouldn’t normally expose themselves in public will do it via SMS, snapchat, or whatsapp if they can hold in their urges long enough to get that far. A lot of people have repressed sexual frustration and they take it out on others who use these apps. I’m sure that there have been hundreds of thousands of men banned on Tinder for being disgusting. In a past life I actually worked for Tinder as a software engineer. I did not gather statistics on these kinds of people, but I have seen millions of profiles. I personally prefer Bumble now because 

I just received this post in my digest and I want to share a little bit about my past experience with Tinder as well as my exposure to creeps on the platform. The definition of a creep is a detestable person deserving of intense dislike. So we begin. My experience with dating apps has been somewhat involved. I worked for a major dating website right out of college and I have seen substantial inappropriate behavior. I would label about one in fifty people true “creeps”. One of my positions held was quality assurance and as such, I would routinely read message threads that were flagged by users.  

Well, if the world is filled with creeps, how can tinder be left behind? Bored and curious on an unproductive weekend in Calcutta (India), I tried the tinder experiment. Additional info: I had an ugly breakup the previous month. Hence, a little compliment and attention from the other sex wouldn't hurt my already massacred self esteem. Background: I am 25, skinny, fair, people pass me off as an attractive girl. I chose a few pictures put an quirky bio and bam, anyone I swiped right replied in seconds. Most of these men claimed to be from premier institutions (IIT, NIT, IIM, ISB, and the likes) dra 

The answer is highly subjective and really depends on what the user expects. Guys will have to send a lot of messages, and most importantly know how to interact virtually. If (and its a big if) they get responses from women and land dates they mostly expect that the person they meet will be who they thought they met online. More than half of the dates I have had through dating apps have been catfishing attempts. Usually it becomes obvious their pictures were taken when they didnt have the extra 100 pounds they now carry. To me this is rather creepy to have happen, which means from my experience 

Yes. So are all other dating sites, so is the local supermarket, library, speed dating events, pubs, clubs etc. Creeps are creeps and sadly they live among us. The internet and social media just gives them a touch of anonymity to enable them to be creeps. Face to face if they flashed their penis they would get arrested at worst or a slap at best. Over dating apps etc its common and what can anyone do other than block you? If you say something inappropriate to a woman in public, again its public so you are likely to get a drink thrown in your face or someone pointing out your behaviour sucks. Ov 

When dating, especially online dating, how do I bring up that I'm a loser? I want to be honest but I don't want women to be turned off by the fact that I don't have a lot going for me.
What are some deal-breakers or major turnoffs that men see in women's online dating profiles?
A few, I will try and list them in order from most egregious to mild annoyance along with the rationale. Nothing: There seems to be a massive amount of people who don’t have anything in their profiles. Rationale: Probably just looking for an ego boost, and probably wont respond at all.People who only write: “How do people know how to write these things?”… (similar to above but different): A:We think and then we write, pretty simple eh? Rationale: I am either going to assume you are an idiot, shy, arrogant, lazy or just a moron. You don’t want to start with someone trying figure out what is wron

Safety-belt selfies. That’s either the corner of 16th &amp; Vanity or the intersection of 22nd &amp; Insecurity outside your 

I love this question. I try to keep a really open mind but these ones drive me especially bonkers. These aren’t deal breakers, more like just WTF’s. Jesus / God comes first. Only because they list they are fine dating an atheist. My kids come first and are my entire life. We know, I have kids, they obviously come first. You only have to put you have kids for someone to know this. Separately if they are literally your entire life, how are you going to make emotional and physical space to share your life with someone else? Again, I’m a single parent who has custody about 90% of the time so I have  

I did online dating a few years ago, now I am engage, so online does work but it does take effort. However, one of the biggest deal-breakers for me was If I saw the following in one form or another on a person’s profile; I tell it like it is, or I am brutally honest, and most often it was followed with a..wanting no drama.The first shows a lack good communication. When people are “Telling like it is” or “are being brutally honest” it is a form of an insult that is a guise in honesty. They believe otherwise it would be sugar coating it. This mentality is very destructive in communication. The be 

In my brief attempt at online dating, I used Okcupid on my laptop. So keep that in mind. My major turnoffs in online dating profiles include: Nothing on your profile: This includes no pictures, nothing in the “about me” section, a one-sentence description, or a bunch of emojis. It just communicates to me that you’re not serious. It also tells me that I can expect one-word, or one-sentence responses to my messages (another deal-breaker for me)Ambiguous pictures: By this I mean you have a picture of something other than you, a quote, meme, or a fuzzy picture, or one not showing your face. Only on

For me at least: Grammar.“Wil luv u 4ever if u no wat I mean so idk hmu. ttyl,”Wow. That’s certainly the sexiest thing that I’ve ever heard. I could really see myself having a wonderful conversation with this one.Snapchat filters.If I wanted to fuck a dog or a flower pot, I would be on Craigslist.Instagram caption.ig: 5hameless_pr0motionAll solo shots.Where are your friends? Do they exist?All group shots with a bunch of similar looking friends.Who are you? I certainly don’t care enough to pick you out of the crowd.All glamour shots.Do you stand around all day snapping cute photos for your insta

I recently started online dating…and I’m a woman seeking other women so I’m not quite the target audience for the question but being so new to the world there are tons of things I notice about women’s profiles that really turn me off. And my insights might be useful since a lot of these things would probably bother men too. Negative profiles listing everything you don’t want, don’t like and what people shouldn’t be…so obnoxious. I understand this world can make people kind of hardened and cynical and what not, but law of attraction 101 here…if all you’re focusing on is what you don’t want, how  

Only been using it just over 2 months, this is a 1st for me as the last time I was single was 10 years ago almost, that was during the VHS dating era (thank god that doesn’t exist anymore). Too many snapchat filters.We cannot see your face for what it is, Alot of the time you do not always look cute in it. It is a dating app you are not supposed to cover your entire face in emojis or alter your appearence with airbrush or warping.Group photos without you being on your own in one of themWe do not know which one is you unless you have an isolated photo of yourself at least once.If you do have an 

I tried a couple of online dating apps, including tinder, a while ago and a few things are an immediate turn off: Boring “likes” There are so many profiles I see on tinder where women list “food” as a thing they like. No really, you like food? Gosh, so do I! So much in common. If you live in Oxford, you tend to see “gin” listed as an interest over and over as well. Great, you drink alcohol. Very exciting. What next, breathing? Actually, sarcasm aside, I would be cool to meet a woman who did have a really deep and passionate interest in things like food or gin; such as if they were big into the sc 

Most of them are already mentioned in the answers but I'm going to write my own list anyway. If the profile says shit like Just looking for friends, No hookups, Don't message if you don't like dogs, etc. I immediately swipe left.Honestly, the dog and cats shit is out of hand. Look, I get it, you love your pets. But saying, “ If you don't like dogs don't swipe left” or “I love my dog more than you” or “ Message me only if you have a cute dog”, is only going to repel men. I don't like having pets, but I will tolerate a dog. What I don't like is a crazy pet lady, I have seen profiles in which wome

If you're a single INTP, can I please see your room?
What is your weirdest experience on Tinder?
Omg… so this is all sorts of Alice in the rabbit hole strange but here goes: After a stretch of a year of celibacy after my LtR of 3 years I decided to put myself back on the market. My situation is a peculiar one in being that I’m a pre-op trans woman, not a negative whatsoever in my book but I understand not a flavor for most men. I decided just in a spin, Tinder, heard the name commonly among friends, figured why not. I honestly didn’t expect to to really find the love of my life, let alone a date, or casual sex but more so like a little sociology experiment. The first liner after my header 

I made an account on tinder in July 2019 while I had a sleepover at my friend’s place. I am single and I am not interested in anyone so my friend was like lets try tinder. I was like okay. i made an account and she told me how to use it and then fast forward I started talking to a guy he was from the same city as I am and I live in Pakistan my city is very small mostly people know each other and somehow he knew my family. we started talking on Snapchat first and then on phone calls. We started talking alot like hours on phone. And then he asked me to meet up I was a bit worried what if someone s 

Can’t imagine many people will read this answer but I have to mention an unforgettable experience I had once using Tinder. I remember matching with her and I was surprised when she replied to me because from her display picture she was stunningly gorgeous. After a period of friendly banter I trusted the girl to be a real life person. I was shocked when she invited me to what she called a secret masquerade ball. She mentioned that she could get me and my friends free wrist bands and VIP access. When finding the girl on Instagram to show my buds she came up with over 10k followers. I was impressed 

I had one and only one Tinder date (in three months). That was my first and last time using it. This was two years ago, I was 51 &amp; had lost my wife to complications from cancer (she had a heart attack after getting hooked on OxyContin in treatment &amp; trying to quit cold turkey) the year before. I met this woman who was supposedly in her early 40’s, but looked 10–15 years younger (I didn’t think anything about it because my family are like that. I got carded to buy cigarettes and beer until my late 40’s since I look (or did then) a lot younger than I am myself. NOT saying I’m good-looking or wha 

He lived local and seemed really sweet…something I soon found out not to be quite the truth. I had been sending messages back and forth to Jay for a week or so during which time I found out he was 36, he lived above one of the local pubs and had 4 children. He'd asked me out for a drink but I already had plans that night to go out with my best friend. He was still eager to meet and invited us both for a drink with him. She agreed we could meet him for a couple of hours so I told my friend that if I used the phrase “I bloody well need the loo" instead of just saying “I'm just going to the loo” i 

25th June  26th June was the last day i texted her or received  I am about to share one more experience i had the chance to live. Thanks to tinder. It was during my first year and i was in the middle of moving on. It was my perspective then. It was good in the beginning but didn't end well. It was a false alarm . I met a girl. She was pursuing ca and she belonged to Kolkata. I was in Kolkata when i matched with her but i didn't text. I usually do but maybe that time i was busy. So one day i was in my hometown and she texted me. She was cute short height and she wore spects.. I imagined a lot of things  

Well I think this is rather strange. We matched, chatted online for a bit, confirmed we both preferred red wine to white. Met in town planning to watch the light festival (Oulu, Finland) but only drank instead. Planned next date where I would come around to her place and we would cook together. Her place because she had a sauna and I didn’t. She also warned me her dog was a very suspicious type, but cat was friendly to all. So I arrived, spoke politest dog to dog who growled at first, but I had him lying on his back exposing belly after 5 minutes. As planned we (I) cooked, then went for the sauna 

After matching on Tinder, I began to message with a girl named Kristi. The conversation was great and we decided to meet. She suggested a double date with a couple. We all met for dinner. The other couple, Jenna and Michael, seemed very nice. The guy and I hit it off and we had a great conversation about music. My date seemed cool, intelligent and was very attractive. After the date, I mentioned via text that Michael and I seemed to hit it off. “Jenna is sick of him,” my date said. “She is planning on dumping him.” Weird, I thought. It was a bit of a shock because I liked the Michael guy. I had h 

I frequent Tinder to have a good laugh with my friends. My female friends and I will often sit together and swipe through, showing off any goofy, funny, or interesting profiles we happen to find. We would sometimes screenshot notable profiles to send in our group chat. Men, just to let you know, we roast your profiles harshly and swipe left the overwhelming majority of the time. So, if you don’t get many matches compared to your “swipe right” ratio, know that women tend to swipe left a lot. Anyway, back when I was a freshman in college (last year), I matched with another freshman. His name was * 

My best friend was on Tinder and decided to meet up with this young lad she had been messaging. It was meant to be a very relaxed hang out and he was to basically tag along at the bar with us two. He got there and instantly decided he hated me (I guess cause I was ‘third-wheeling’ their date - she wanted me there incase he was a creep). He was incredibly rude to me all night, which obviously didn’t go down well with my mate as we were really close so it was important anyone she was to date would like me too or at least have enough common decency to treat me with respect and be polite! Anyway, h 

Is online dating worth it?
What is your biggest Tinder failure?
Thank you for a good question. One of my greatest failures on Tinder was a girl I met a few years back. We used to have occasional conversations and lived in other countries. She seemed pretty, smart and well behaved. We decided to do something insane - we decided to go to a vacation together without seeing each other in real life. Long story short we met at the airport, and have decided that we won't have any expectations to each other. I must say that the first impression was good - I felt like I was 17 going for a date first time in my life. We flew to an island in Europe, the flight took a f 

I had a brilliant student who wrote an essay about his worst Tinder experience for my creative nonfiction class. His response was so legendary that the essay was not only given a first-class pass but it was shared by generations of students. We made him swear that this was a true story and knowing the wild life that the kid led, I have no doubts about its authenticity. When this student was an undergraduate he went to England with a bunch of friends. It was obviously just a booze cruise around the country and he wound up in a fairly remote part of the countryside in a small pub getting extremel 

I had a remarkably short and painful couple of months messing around on Tinder several years ago. The biggest Tinder failure was undoubtedly signing up to begin with! That said, I wasn't exactly coming to the party as an ideal candidate. At the time I was 34 years old and recently divorced. I'm also taller than most men, so that makes strike three. Maybe I should've gotten the hint right there ;p Strictly your amusement - Met guy #1 at a bar (of course, how else does one make it through?!) and while he looked like his pictures, I was taken aback by his faux bling. On his shirt, his watch….you get 

Zombor looked exactly like you'd expect a man called Zombor to look. Pale skin stretched over a thick, protruding brow. A shiny bald head, ridged with strips of jaw muscle and misaligned bone. Tall. Wide. Looked like he spent his evenings getting mean-drunk on cheap, paint-stripper vodka and starting fights with cows. And his eyes. Beneath that hooded brow sat beads of polished coal, tar wrapped in glass, the aftermath of an oil spill.

I’m old school. Pre-Tinder if you will. In my hey day, we did instant messenger as cell phones and calling cards were metered by minutes. At my height I did well, I was a mighty hunter (of the armchair variety). My friends would make fun of the fact I had a phone harem. I admit, I was an addict. I talked to females from around the world, getting them to be bad was all a part of the fun. I used my real photos. Spent a small fortune on calling cards. I had countless encounters. A few emotional relationships developed it was nice at the time. Then I evolved, I wanted more, I wanted the physical st 

What is your biggest Tinder failure? I don’t personally have one, but I know who does have the worst. My close acquaintance I knew years ago when I was a technician in the Navy, told me a bone chilling story that had me trying to figure out where would most people draw the line between taboo, and acceptable behavior. This isn’t just his biggest Tinder failure, but perhaps his biggest failure in life too. I was told this story by a man who we will call Shane. So Shane was getting into trouble with girls from a very young age. In passing, he told me that a girl had once accused him of the “extra b 

Ah. This question was long overdue. So this was 2–3 years back when I was one of Tinder’s most prized regular customers (pretty sure their India office had a picture of me on their wall). I was in Bangalore, fresh out of MBA , earning pretty well and had a nice room with a GORGEOUS balcony view to myself in a posh apartment complex. I was going through Tinder matches like there was no tomorrow. And then I matched with her. Let’s call her ‘Alisha’ (obviously not her real name) Alisha was also a graduate from a top B-school like me. Few years older. At a pretty sweet post in an FMCG and a butt load 

Woah, such a question. Sure my story truly belongs here. Intro As you can see from my profile and previous answers, I have used Tinder for finding sex dates only. My profile clearly stated it. It was what I began each conversation with. So I always was all-in. Once Upon A Time (not in Hollywood, unfortunately) It was a match. Not that popular event, when you are pretty straightforward in your profile. I double checked her profile, She seemed to be a real and sooo adorable. My imagination for upcoming friends-with-benefits future was brighter than for my future at all. So that, let the party be sta 

We first started talking on Tinder around September 2017 when I started college. He was working at a real estate firm. We tried to meet up several times, but our schedules never matched up. He also went to Europe with his family for a vacation while I was in New York. Around December or so, he ended up getting into a relationship I believe. In early 2018, we hit each other up from time to time. By 2018, he probably quit his real estate job and started bartending and waiting tables. I hit him up on Instagram during my spring break in late April asking him if he wanted to meet up. For the first t 

I dont remember if we matched on Tinder or Hinge, i used to have both. Anyway i spoke to this guys for a few days before we went on a date. He seemed really cool and interesting. He texted one day asking if i wanted to go to the beach with him, i was at the gym and said well if u dont mind that i go on our first date with zero makeup and gym clothes . He said he actually dint like makeup so it was perfect haha We met half way. He drove us to the beach. The day was so beautiful! He brought a blanket, drinks and his dog (so cute). We were talking for a while he was pretty cool, playing with the dog,

What is a good first date location?
I will tell you about my dating strategy and how to progressively make the girl more and more comfortable. It works most of the times but yup sometimes it doesn’t. I am still learning. :) My first date is three step: I tell her to meet me at a public place. A coffee shop/ A mall etc. I will start with hugs, talking about normal stuffs. 15 min max Then comes the mid part. This is about building connection. We move to a more enjoyable location where I don’t have to talk all the time and there would be other activity to involve with. Since I don’t drink, we would usually go to a book store/ Bowling  

You worked up the courage to get her number and she even said yes to a date! There’s a feeling of excitement as the day gets closer, but as the day gets closer you’re still not sure where to go… Or maybe you haven’t gotten that far yet, maybe you just got her number and you’re trying to figure out where to ask her out. What would make a great date? Is it a rousing game of mini-golf? Bowling? Dinner and a movie? Or just straight asking her over to your place? None of the above! The reason that activity dates don’t work is because you want the women in your life to date you for you, not for the activi 

The whole point of a first day is to get to know one another. Its also a good idea to have fun together and create a memorable experience so that you and your date will continue onto other future dates together. Here are some helpful hints. Be comfortable, choose a place that is not too noisy so that you can actually hear each other speak. The last thing you want is to have to keep on asking the other person to repeat themselves. Amusement parks can be a good choice, because there are a variety of things to do. You can also move way from noisy areas and find quieter places to eat and talk.Avoid 

The best first dates will give the impression that they were completely improvised to come together like serendipity and yet ended up executed flawlessly. Generally speaking, these best first dates will move between a number of different locations rather than staying in one place. Staying in one place the whole time makes a date feel very static. Movement creates energy. Also, it’s better if you can walk between the places you’ll go on your date rather than drive. So the ideal general area to plan a date is in a downtown urban area, where there are a lot of things to do, and a lot of places you  

This is a very common problem, but also a very worthy of thinking. Because it's about whether a relationship can last forever. Most of the time, two people cut off contact after meeting each other, and some people have deeper feelings after the first date. So, how do they do it? According to my observation and the experience of my friends, I can recommend several places to you according to different personalities!  一、The first: shy personality People with this character are more suitable to go to some public places or places with many people. 1. Park. The park is a very good place, the environment  

We both reached restaurant on time. The waiter came to our table with a menu. I ordered sev puri and strawberry juice, whereas Rubina ordered just a glass of orange juice. I said, "North Indian recipes are delicious here. You should try it." "No, I had a heavy lunch." There was pin drop silence for some time. That usually happens during the first date. Rubina did not attempt to make friendly conversation. Maybe she was thinking that I was not a good match for her. Nevertheless, I refused to give up and tried my best to strike a bond of friendship with her. "What is your plan?" I asked. She gazed towards me  

Haha, dating might not be my cup of tea, but I’m pretty good while selecting dating venues :p GENERAL ADVICE(S): First dates are meant to understand your partner and spend some quality time, keeps things nice, and take it slow.If you're going for a drive, play some music from Beethoven or Mozart (I personally advice moonlight sonata ), it'll make a good impression and you don't have to worry about your partner’s preference as everyone loves Mozart and Beethoven.Avoid going to gardens and open air public places if you live in a small town ( ANTI ROMEO SQUAD will beat the S**t out of you if they’l

Hiking, ideally in the mountains.  The best thing about hiking is that it takes away all the tension. You stop worrying about your looks instantly as you put your foot in the mud. There’s really not much you can do about it, so you just accept that it’s part of the hiking and it’s okay. But if you still worry about dirty shoes, wait for 10 minutes until he/she also steps into the puddle. Trust me, at this point, you won’t be worrying about your shoes or looks. Plus, hiking brings people together. There’s a high chance you’ll come across some difficulty, like crossing the river or climbing something.   

Don’t be a hero, and keep it simple. If you’re over 21, I’d do a bar. If you’re under 21, maybe coffee or a bite to eat. Assuming that you met online, or out in a situation where you just met her, you don’t even know if you’ll have chemistry for an entire evening. This is your chance to see if you have chemistry. You don’t want to be stuck on a hike or an amusement park with a girl that you don’t ever want to see again. Or even worse, where you had a great time and found the love of your life and she drops the “no chemistry but you’re a great guy” bombshell on you when you text her the next da 

it depends on many factors such as age, taste,,,, etc but From my experience … the best date ever is in a BOWLING ALLEY. This place have all the component of a nice date experience. Advantages : 1- knowing you are going to a bowling game, you both would wear something comfortable like jeans, shorts, t-shirts etc,,, which will help both of you to be more comfortable. 2- you are on a date, so it doesn't matter if you won or lost “preferably make the girl win ;)” 3- there will be lots of laughs and positive energy during the game. 4- you don't need to sit at the table looking at each other trying to f 

What is a hobby that you might not want to mention on a first date?
What unrealistic expectations do women often have about men when it comes to dating?
They want a prince charming who will also pull them by the hair and slap their ass in the act of coitus. When I was growing up it was that we wanted the perfect gentlemen who would also be an animal. But we also wanted to stay ‘good girls’. There’s a confusing thing right there. After getting married, I learned the truth is that there are men who know how to be perfect gentlemen who are also animals in the sack, but here’s the thing: You can’t know that they’re both of those things when you’ve JUST STARTED dating, or just considering dating them for that matter. Because if a guy treats a perfe

That men should simultaneously be more masculine and less masculine at the same time Men should: Enjoy the viewNot look at a woman like a piece of meatAlways be the ones to make the approachNot bother women on the street, public places, etc.Not take “no” for an answerImmediately give up at the first sign of rejectionTreat women as special class to be honored and protectedTreat women as equalsHave the social skills to attract womenNot learn from other men how to attract womenEtc.Now some of these I agree with and some I don't, but the point is, they are somewhat mutually exclusive ideas and all c 

These don’t apply to all women, but very common among the women who annoy me most yet seem to be bouncing from one boyfriend to another. When a woman likes a man, she doesn't drop any visible hints, yet she expects the man to know she likes him.For heavens’ sake, why can't you ask him out?Similarly, men do not have to be the one to propose. No law says that.A woman expects her boyfriend to be guard, nurse, cook, maid, slave, ATM, sex toy, rescuer and stress reliever all at the same time.Why can't you hire one for each?A woman expects the man to know answers to everything.A woman feels entitled 

A lot of women want men to have the bodies of Greek Gods and their favorite Hollywood actor. But they also want them to pay a lot of attention to them, do activities with them and go on dates, etc. Trying to get a ripped, toned body takes a lot of time and effort in the gym and a strict diet that doesn't exactly accommodate social outings like dates or movies and takes away from time that the guy could spend paying attention to the woman. Women seem to hate the idea that men get aroused and watch porn and masturbate while in a relationship. “Aren't I enough for you? Don't I satisfy you? Why do  

My understanding of the sexual marketplace is as follows (note a degree of hyperbole since I am referring to the Ubermensch here, but can back up many of these too, seems especially common in urban environments): -He is a charismatic, prestigious, highly successful and handsome man, creme de la creme, but he does it effortlessly, always has stress managed, never loses control, indeed any problems he has had were resolved before he proceeded into the dating world -A double standard is only a double standard if she decides it is because Vagina -Unattractive men desiring sex are innately misogynists 

The most unrealistic expectation, aka the biggest mistake women often have about men is they think men will change. For love. Because of love. My cousin came crying to me in 2005. She was a very successful real estate agent. Her husband was addicted to gambling. He was massively in debt, and she, being in love with him, sold three houses in Sydney paying his debt. And he still went on to gamble. I asked her if she had known this dark side of him. Yes, she did but she had hoped he would have changed and been responsible. For love. Because of love. I told her to get a divorce because he was a lost  

The most unrealistic expectation I see women having is the same one I see men having: that there's some sort of secret code to the opposite sex, and if you can just crack it, all your romantic dreams will come true.  You see it expressed here all the time in questions like, "I texted a guy and it took him two days to respond. What does that mean?" "This guy I like offered to give me a ride to the airport. Why did he do that?" and "What do men want from women?" All of these questions--and the male versions ("A girl smiled at me. What does it mean?")--operate within the context that there's such a 

Let me bring a Chinese perspective to this question. Among Chinese women, there are quite a few unrealistic expectations that they are not giving up easily. Again, this does not apply to all women in China, just based on my observation. When we've been dating for a certain amount of time, he should propose to me. Usually, that amount of time is one year. This is not what women are subjected to, the country has this unwritten rule at heart for age-appropriate-for-marriage people. However, people don't realize that men may not be prone to settling down before they turn 30. Some men never gave it m

Unrealistic expectations SOME women have about men when it comes to dating: A man should show interest first/make the first move.A man should pay for most or all of the date.That he should have a lot of money.That he should plan and decide the date, unless directed otherwise.That he should have the psychic ability to read her mind.That he should change parts of who he is to better suit what a woman wants (this goes both ways, btw).That he should chase her (literally and/or figuratively) if she’s upset.That, even if it hasn’t been talked about or agreed upon, he shouldn’t be sleeping with anyone

The question I originally answered is this: What unrealistic expectations do women often have about men when it comes to dating? This is probably the easiest Quora question I have ever answered, as I have complained about this for much of my life.   Women expect men to read their minds.  Not only that, but read their emotions as well, even if they have very differing needs and emotions at any given time.   The best way to illustrate this example is to relate a personal story of a friend of mine.  She was one of those cute but sorta awkward girls who looks too virginly to attract a guy, as they as 

Is it okay to ask a girl before kissing her for the first time?
No, never do that nerdy thing. I was told to tell her by many when I had asked the same in Quora. It was such a stupid thing to do when I asked her. She looked at me like I was a kid asking for a chocolate and she said no, smilingly. That relationship didn’t go for long. After that I have kissed a few girls and never did the same mistake of asking her. There are a lot of factors involved: Your surroundings: She may not like to kiss when there are people around or she may not like to kiss when there are no people around. So, you need to know what she likes. If you know her a bit already, it help

Yes and no. You can kiss whom so ever you want.  But consent is always needed in any case, either verbal or non-verbal. Here, the context is missing. Is the girl you're kissing your girlfriend, the girl you went out on a date, the girl who's is your friend or some random girl? We will consider here you're referring to someone you like or you're out on a date. Verbal She simply asks you to kiss her or you ask her for the kiss. And you move further if you both love to kiss each other. Non-verbal It usually happens when you're dating that person or dated few people so you can understand social cues and yo 

First of all….I’m a female. Second, I’ve had men kiss me without asking and have had men kiss me after asking. BOTH are good depending on the situation. However, I don’t think it is ever wrong to ask. I would definitely not take it as a sign that you are not brave or assertive enough or any of that nonsense. And, in this day and age, consent is important. I think it can be incredibly sexy to be asked. I think it’s important to be aware of the situation and your surroundings. Ideally, you’ve had some nice conversation, a few smiles have passed between you (yes, you can just turn to a girl and sm 

It depends on the girl. I've been with women who were turned on by the fact that I asked. And others wanted to be claimed and kissed. The real answer here goes down to 2 things: Connecting with the girl to know what she is like so that you don't have to figure it out.Learn to work on HOW you say it and not just WHAT you say.You can tell a girl something silly and still turn her on. If you ask her if you could kiss her but feel uncertain, she will most probably say no. Women mirror your feelings almost all the time. But if you ask her while feeling sexy and confident within yourself, look her in t 

Original question: “Do you always ask a girl before kissing her?” Answer: It depends. More specifically, it depends on her. Who is SHE to YOU? Either she’s someone that you’re very interested in, i.e.- girlfriend material…..or she’s someone that you’re experimenting with. What’s the difference you ask? Well….if she’s someone that you’re interested in, and who is also interested in you- then sharing a mutual kiss will more than likely be one of those moments where it won’t be planned or scripted. It’ll just happen and no words will be necessary in that event. On the other hand, if she’s someone that 

That’s very much OK even though strangely, asking is likely to call the whole thing off. Rather like ‘Faint heart never won fair maiden.’ It’s hard; almost impossible, to tell but you’re supposed to be able both to tell and to accept the consequences if you get it wrong. This is true in most cultures even though at the same time no-one; not your mother or father, big brother or sister, aunts or uncles or neighbours or teachers, is likely to explain the rules. Luckily the worst consequence if you get a kiss wrong is likely to be that she flees into the night and you never see or hear from her aga 

No. It looks weak and it is. It’s a way for you to decrease the risk of going ahead and trying it. The problem is that it kills any attraction. A man asking permission becomes a boy. A woman isn’t attracted to a boy. So it’s a fine line you have to walk. You need to be ready and willing to accept it if she does not want to, while bold and brave enough to take the step. There’s some good advice in other answers here. It’s always a risk the first time. Risk mitigation would tell you to be prepared for worst case (she declines), and not to make it mean rejection of you as a person or of kissing you.  

I think asking is a must. Suppose the girls really wanna be kissed and you conjecture it. Then if you ask her she will remain silent. It doesnt mean that she is detesting you in her mind. Take it she is eager to be kissed. And once you determine yourselfe that she wanna be kissed , you can kiss her any way. she can face any kind of kiss you prefer without being shocked. (though she thought of a peck she can easily tolerate lip lock smooch) And now suppose she thought of a lip lock and you gave her a peck, this is a little bit disappointing for her. So when she is silent and you assume that she 

This should be the norm. Human beings are strange for not conversing about sex, yet they do it. You wouldn't give me food without knowing whether or not I am hungry, you'd ask if I want water, or am tired and so on. It is kind of disrespectful to both people when consent is not explicit (this does not mean verbal, necessarily. Agreeable body language would suffice. If someone pulls away, don’t push. Same for when someone turns their face), I think. Even though I haven't quite asked all the time, I hardly ever proceeded without explicit consent. I have once been kissed without an assumption - whi 

If you mean "is it ethical," of course it is. It will make sure she wants your kiss when you kiss her. That's far preferable to the alternative. If you're really asking "will it turn her off if I do so?" sometimes, yes. There are some women who will not like this. For some of them, asking for a kiss is a sign you're not assertive or brave. For others, it's a sign you're bad at picking up on her "obvious" signals. In these cases, it might be in your best interest to have them reject you anyway, as this could be the start of a long series of unshared expectations, which will ultimately be hell in

There’s one common mistake men make that stops them from having a good dating life. And sadly, I’d guess at least 90% of men make this mistake. Hell, I’ve made it many times.

There’s nothing wrong with that - so long as you make it clear that you like her. Every day you spend not putting yourself out there with your crush is a day you’re not getting back.

When you do all of these things, say "we should" rather than asking. she'll let you know if she disgrees... 3. Don't dress too outrageously. Keep it relatively mainstream.

These women may appear as cocky and challenging but they are high value women that stay with you for a long time and who contribute to yo 

Speak your mind: Don’t rethink each and every thought. If something pops into your mind, say it right away."Many of us prevent every chance of being interesting by running what we want to say through a filter that makes sure it's appropriate." – Julian Reisinger If you're thinking silently “I'd love to tell her how nervous I was before I came here but I don't want her to think I'm insecure”, then that's exactly what you should be saying to her. First, she'd feel special, and second, she'd appreciate your honesty and that you're trusting her. This type of vulnerability attracts and connects people 

What is the most 'WTF' thing that someone said to you while on a first date? Was there a second date?
Is it okay to ask a girl before kissing her for the first time?
No, never do that nerdy thing. I was told to tell her by many when I had asked the same in Quora. It was such a stupid thing to do when I asked her. She looked at me like I was a kid asking for a chocolate and she said no, smilingly. That relationship didn’t go for long. After that I have kissed a few girls and never did the same mistake of asking her. There are a lot of factors involved: Your surroundings: She may not like to kiss when there are people around or she may not like to kiss when there are no people around. So, you need to know what she likes. If you know her a bit already, it help

Yes and no. You can kiss whom so ever you want.  But consent is always needed in any case, either verbal or non-verbal. Here, the context is missing. Is the girl you're kissing your girlfriend, the girl you went out on a date, the girl who's is your friend or some random girl? We will consider here you're referring to someone you like or you're out on a date. Verbal She simply asks you to kiss her or you ask her for the kiss. And you move further if you both love to kiss each other. Non-verbal It usually happens when you're dating that person or dated few people so you can understand social cues and yo 

First of all….I’m a female. Second, I’ve had men kiss me without asking and have had men kiss me after asking. BOTH are good depending on the situation. However, I don’t think it is ever wrong to ask. I would definitely not take it as a sign that you are not brave or assertive enough or any of that nonsense. And, in this day and age, consent is important. I think it can be incredibly sexy to be asked. I think it’s important to be aware of the situation and your surroundings. Ideally, you’ve had some nice conversation, a few smiles have passed between you (yes, you can just turn to a girl and sm 

It depends on the girl. I've been with women who were turned on by the fact that I asked. And others wanted to be claimed and kissed. The real answer here goes down to 2 things: Connecting with the girl to know what she is like so that you don't have to figure it out.Learn to work on HOW you say it and not just WHAT you say.You can tell a girl something silly and still turn her on. If you ask her if you could kiss her but feel uncertain, she will most probably say no. Women mirror your feelings almost all the time. But if you ask her while feeling sexy and confident within yourself, look her in t 

Original question: “Do you always ask a girl before kissing her?” Answer: It depends. More specifically, it depends on her. Who is SHE to YOU? Either she’s someone that you’re very interested in, i.e.- girlfriend material…..or she’s someone that you’re experimenting with. What’s the difference you ask? Well….if she’s someone that you’re interested in, and who is also interested in you- then sharing a mutual kiss will more than likely be one of those moments where it won’t be planned or scripted. It’ll just happen and no words will be necessary in that event. On the other hand, if she’s someone that 

That’s very much OK even though strangely, asking is likely to call the whole thing off. Rather like ‘Faint heart never won fair maiden.’ It’s hard; almost impossible, to tell but you’re supposed to be able both to tell and to accept the consequences if you get it wrong. This is true in most cultures even though at the same time no-one; not your mother or father, big brother or sister, aunts or uncles or neighbours or teachers, is likely to explain the rules. Luckily the worst consequence if you get a kiss wrong is likely to be that she flees into the night and you never see or hear from her aga 

No. It looks weak and it is. It’s a way for you to decrease the risk of going ahead and trying it. The problem is that it kills any attraction. A man asking permission becomes a boy. A woman isn’t attracted to a boy. So it’s a fine line you have to walk. You need to be ready and willing to accept it if she does not want to, while bold and brave enough to take the step. There’s some good advice in other answers here. It’s always a risk the first time. Risk mitigation would tell you to be prepared for worst case (she declines), and not to make it mean rejection of you as a person or of kissing you.  

I think asking is a must. Suppose the girls really wanna be kissed and you conjecture it. Then if you ask her she will remain silent. It doesnt mean that she is detesting you in her mind. Take it she is eager to be kissed. And once you determine yourselfe that she wanna be kissed , you can kiss her any way. she can face any kind of kiss you prefer without being shocked. (though she thought of a peck she can easily tolerate lip lock smooch) And now suppose she thought of a lip lock and you gave her a peck, this is a little bit disappointing for her. So when she is silent and you assume that she 

This should be the norm. Human beings are strange for not conversing about sex, yet they do it. You wouldn't give me food without knowing whether or not I am hungry, you'd ask if I want water, or am tired and so on. It is kind of disrespectful to both people when consent is not explicit (this does not mean verbal, necessarily. Agreeable body language would suffice. If someone pulls away, don’t push. Same for when someone turns their face), I think. Even though I haven't quite asked all the time, I hardly ever proceeded without explicit consent. I have once been kissed without an assumption - whi 

If you mean "is it ethical," of course it is. It will make sure she wants your kiss when you kiss her. That's far preferable to the alternative. If you're really asking "will it turn her off if I do so?" sometimes, yes. There are some women who will not like this. For some of them, asking for a kiss is a sign you're not assertive or brave. For others, it's a sign you're bad at picking up on her "obvious" signals. In these cases, it might be in your best interest to have them reject you anyway, as this could be the start of a long series of unshared expectations, which will ultimately be hell in 

I have a crush on a waitress at a restaurant I'm frequently having lunch in. How should I invite her for a date?
As someone who in my younger years dated many waitresses and who is now happily married to a former waitress may I recommend the following: Go to the restaurant more than once. Familiarity builds rapport. Don’t turn this into being a stalker but you can politely ask someone their general schedule without being creepy. If you go on Wednesday and she’s there simply ask and proofer your own information first like “I stop by after Wednesday at work because I’m enroute to (somekind of activity); do you always work Wednesday?” Generally speaking the response will be a description of their general sch

I was on a National Guard sniper team paired up with a guy named Mike. One training weekend, while on liberty, we went out for Chinese food for dinner. Mike told me about the Chinese restaurant near his home where there were two cute waitresses, one of whom he wanted to ask out. I think he said her name was Liu. The problem was these girls didn’t speak much English at all, but Mike had a plan. He was going to call the girl over to his table and ask her out in writing. Chinese writing. I wasn’t sure I believed him, so we borrowed a pen from the waiter and he started writing Chinese characters on 

I was a waiter and restaurant manager for several years, so I had a front-row seat on how waitresses would occasionally meet up with male customers. First, he would have to be a guy she found attractive and interesting, even though there was very little time available — often virtually none — to chat and get acquainted. Second, the meetup would be in that restaurant’s bar. He would ask when she was off work, and say that he would be in the bar and offer to buy her a drink. She wouldn’t have to decide right then; she usually said “maybe”. At the end of her shift, she could decide then whether to  

Don’t. Seriously. It’s mostly going to be women answering this, and you should listen to them rather than me, but I’m going to give you a little advice: Never hit on a woman who can’t run away. Okay, that could probably be phrased more gently, but it’s a good rule of thumb*. First, there’s the simple chance of making her uncomfortable. She’s in this position of “I have to talk to you, so I’m going to play nice”, even if she is in no way interested. Which means all the subtle “yes, I’m into you” signals are tainted and can’t be trusted. Second, you haven’t given her the opportunity to be able to sa 

So you’ve got your eye on more than a piece of pie? Well I’ve done my research and I’ll tell you now that a waitress is a mythical creature that’s rarely seen and almost impossible to capture and take home… No, sorry. That’s Bigfoot. I always get the two confused. Still, asking out a waitress is fraught with danger. Get it wrong and you’ll have the cook spit in your soup. But get it right and you’ll be the talk of the town!!! Though the cook will still spit in your soup (it’s just something he does). Forget what you’ve heard too. Girls aren’t looking for a guy with the biggest tip in his pants. And I 

If you have to ask how, you probably shouldn’t. What do you even know about her? Is she single? Available? Straight? Seriously, you are talking about a complete stranger. Rule of the road- women get hit on all the time. Women in service jobs like waitressing really git hit on all the time. Just consider how you would feel if, in the course of your normal workday dealing with a bunch of people, some random percentage of them harassed you for a date, and you had to be nice to them regardless, because, well, it’s your job. Don’t be that guy. Also, women have a way of showing interest. Sometimes it’ 

Most of the times you shouldn’t. I did ask a waitress out once, but it was just right because of many reasons: I was sitting by myself. I had no dates with me.She started a conversation and was flirty all the time; not like “make customer happy for a tip or for he to come back” flirty, but sincerely flirty. I could tell because she was also waiting some other people including other men sitting by themselves and it was definetely different with me.I didn’t actually ask her out, but rather asked her what time they closed as I knew they closed early, and she asked me if I was planning on going som

Ignore most of the answers here. DO NOT invest in an elaborate plan over multiple visits. Save that kind of commitment for girls that have shown at least some level of interest, which your waitress definitely has not at this point (any flirtatious action on her part is likely just doing her job). In this situation, BE DIRECT. Talk to her for a few minutes, laugh once or twice, then say “you're cute, how about you and I get a coffee sometime?” Try to say it like it just occurred to you, like something she did just made you realize she could be date material.

You could just ask, but be prepared to stop eating there… I’ve never asked my waitress out, but I’ve been present for a number of attempts, successes, and failures. In one case, a friend *wasn’t* hitting on a waitress, but he felt bad that we’d hung out at Perkins (kind of like Denny’s) for hours, holding up a 12-top section. He tipped 150%, in part because people had kicked in a bunch of cash and sorting out refunds wasn’t happening, but also because he was a nice guy with a credit card. Our waitress asked “what do you want from me?” That same waitress ended up going out for a while with a diffe

I was out for lunch with some (male) co-workers, and it turned out that one of them, Farrell, was very shy and having trouble asking girls out.

As a guy who has never been on a date before, what 5 things are considered crossing the line?

What are some things not to do if you are dating a Russian woman?
What is a good first date location?
I will tell you about my dating strategy and how to progressively make the girl more and more comfortable. It works most of the times but yup sometimes it doesn’t. I am still learning. :) My first date is three step: I tell her to meet me at a public place. A coffee shop/ A mall etc. I will start with hugs, talking about normal stuffs. 15 min max Then comes the mid part. This is about building connection. We move to a more enjoyable location where I don’t have to talk all the time and there would be other activity to involve with. Since I don’t drink, we would usually go to a book store/ Bowling  

You worked up the courage to get her number and she even said yes to a date! There’s a feeling of excitement as the day gets closer, but as the day gets closer you’re still not sure where to go… Or maybe you haven’t gotten that far yet, maybe you just got her number and you’re trying to figure out where to ask her out. What would make a great date? Is it a rousing game of mini-golf? Bowling? Dinner and a movie? Or just straight asking her over to your place? None of the above! The reason that activity dates don’t work is because you want the women in your life to date you for you, not for the activi 

The whole point of a first day is to get to know one another. Its also a good idea to have fun together and create a memorable experience so that you and your date will continue onto other future dates together. Here are some helpful hints. Be comfortable, choose a place that is not too noisy so that you can actually hear each other speak. The last thing you want is to have to keep on asking the other person to repeat themselves. Amusement parks can be a good choice, because there are a variety of things to do. You can also move way from noisy areas and find quieter places to eat and talk.Avoid 

The best first dates will give the impression that they were completely improvised to come together like serendipity and yet ended up executed flawlessly. Generally speaking, these best first dates will move between a number of different locations rather than staying in one place. Staying in one place the whole time makes a date feel very static. Movement creates energy. Also, it’s better if you can walk between the places you’ll go on your date rather than drive. So the ideal general area to plan a date is in a downtown urban area, where there are a lot of things to do, and a lot of places you  

This is a very common problem, but also a very worthy of thinking. Because it's about whether a relationship can last forever. Most of the time, two people cut off contact after meeting each other, and some people have deeper feelings after the first date. So, how do they do it? According to my observation and the experience of my friends, I can recommend several places to you according to different personalities!  一、The first: shy personality People with this character are more suitable to go to some public places or places with many people. 1. Park. The park is a very good place, the environment  

We both reached restaurant on time. The waiter came to our table with a menu. I ordered sev puri and strawberry juice, whereas Rubina ordered just a glass of orange juice. I said, "North Indian recipes are delicious here. You should try it." "No, I had a heavy lunch." There was pin drop silence for some time. That usually happens during the first date. Rubina did not attempt to make friendly conversation. Maybe she was thinking that I was not a good match for her. Nevertheless, I refused to give up and tried my best to strike a bond of friendship with her. "What is your plan?" I asked. She gazed towards me  

Haha, dating might not be my cup of tea, but I’m pretty good while selecting dating venues :p GENERAL ADVICE(S): First dates are meant to understand your partner and spend some quality time, keeps things nice, and take it slow.If you're going for a drive, play some music from Beethoven or Mozart (I personally advice moonlight sonata ), it'll make a good impression and you don't have to worry about your partner’s preference as everyone loves Mozart and Beethoven.Avoid going to gardens and open air public places if you live in a small town ( ANTI ROMEO SQUAD will beat the S**t out of you if they’l

Hiking, ideally in the mountains.  The best thing about hiking is that it takes away all the tension. You stop worrying about your looks instantly as you put your foot in the mud. There’s really not much you can do about it, so you just accept that it’s part of the hiking and it’s okay. But if you still worry about dirty shoes, wait for 10 minutes until he/she also steps into the puddle. Trust me, at this point, you won’t be worrying about your shoes or looks. Plus, hiking brings people together. There’s a high chance you’ll come across some difficulty, like crossing the river or climbing something.   

Don’t be a hero, and keep it simple. If you’re over 21, I’d do a bar. If you’re under 21, maybe coffee or a bite to eat. Assuming that you met online, or out in a situation where you just met her, you don’t even know if you’ll have chemistry for an entire evening. This is your chance to see if you have chemistry. You don’t want to be stuck on a hike or an amusement park with a girl that you don’t ever want to see again. Or even worse, where you had a great time and found the love of your life and she drops the “no chemistry but you’re a great guy” bombshell on you when you text her the next da 

it depends on many factors such as age, taste,,,, etc but From my experience … the best date ever is in a BOWLING ALLEY. This place have all the component of a nice date experience. Advantages : 1- knowing you are going to a bowling game, you both would wear something comfortable like jeans, shorts, t-shirts etc,,, which will help both of you to be more comfortable. 2- you are on a date, so it doesn't matter if you won or lost “preferably make the girl win ;)” 3- there will be lots of laughs and positive energy during the game. 4- you don't need to sit at the table looking at each other trying to f 

When dating, especially online dating, how do I bring up that I'm a loser? I want to be honest but I don't want women to be turned off by the fact that I don't have a lot going for me.
Why can't I find a good girl? I am 21 and a good-looking guy, I have been told by many people. But the last girl made me lose all my confidence. What’s wrong?
First, understand that the only person who matters is you. Define ‘good’ for yourself. Now, promise yourself that you won’t flirt/date anyone who does not fit this criteria. Dropdead gorgeous or not, whether she is easy to get or not, promise yourself you would maintain integrity about who you want to be with. The fact is that we are always afraid of being lonely. We are ready to love whoever shows a little interest or respond to us. Only later do you realize that she does not check the boxes that matter most to you. And by that time, your heart is already twisted and confused. It takes hell o 

SPICE I was horrible at finding a good person. I was insecure, I was scared to talk to people. I was weird looking. And I was a liar. Even worse, I was always attracted to people who were bad for me in various ways. Either they didn’t like me (which always made me feel worse once I “outsourced” my self-esteem to them) or they had problems that were too big for me to handle. Or I had problems too big for them to handle. I haven’t been emotionally mature in most of my relationships. So when I was in my 20s, I had to figure out a 2-step plan to define “good” and then what do I have to do to meet good 

Dude: Let me take you on a reality trip for the USA: If you are looking for a fit woman, 30% are NOT overweightIf you are looking for a NON married one then at 50%If you are looking for a BRIGHT one then at 50%If you are looking in your AGE bracket at 30%If you are looking for a given PERSONALITY match at 30%If you are looking for a SANE one then go with 25%Now don’t let the math intimidate you, but what you have to figure out is called cumulative yield by multiplying all the numbers above together: Cumulative Yield = 0.3 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.25 = 0.0017 or 0.17% Your population for super g 

 Logically thinking, there is a contradiction between your title and your description. According to your question, you want to find a good girl, while according to your description you have chosen a bad one. So I’d start with realizing what I truly want if I was in your situation. No matter the case, don’t force things. When it comes to women, wanting is not getting. Face this harsh reality and lower your expectations. We’re all going through this. Another thing is that the two people who form a couple should be on the same level, right? (financial, intellectual, emotional, you name it). Or, at leas 

Well like Robert said, “good” is a relative term. It means different things for different people. I’ll assume that you mean a girl who’s attractive, exciting, kind, caring, loving, dependable, mature, and adventurous. Most of those qualities, anyhow, since if she’d have all those qualities she’d be damn near perfect in my book. The quickest way to find a good girl (and not scare her off) is to develop those traits yourself. Being super nice to a girl doesn’t mean super attractive. Assholes aren’t attractive either, but being “super nice” alone doesn’t cut it most of the time. Here’s my story, it 

Life doesn't usually seem rational. Karma doesn't balance things out, good people get treated unfairly, random, terrible things happen. People cheat on their partners with that person's best friend. People pull away from those who treat them phenomenally. People lash out for seemingly no reason. It's just how it is. We're always playing the odds, and that seems to be especially true in relationships.Other people are always rational, even if it doesn't seem that way. How someone else acts may seem not to make sense, but it makes perfect sense. We just haven't seen all the factors that lead up t

A good girl is hard to find… and when one comes along (becomes available) it is quickly noticed by the rest of the population. If she is willing, she won’t be available long. If she’s amazing AND available, there is a really good reason. Too much emotional baggage or damage is most likely, or not interested in settling down is another. You may get to know her and find that there were some deal-breakers hidden below the surface - drama queen, mean-spirited, or vain and selfish. Anyway, the reason it’s hard to find a “good girl” is because of competition. The good ones that want to be taken are t 

People always say you shouldn’t look for love, it will find you. I never really understood that because nothing else in life works that way. If you want a loaf of bread you have to go to the store and get it …it doesn’t wait until you “love yourself” and then show up at your door. I say if you’re lonely or needy, go find someone, BUT don’t think about marriage at your age. The list of check-boxes you have for desired traits in a mate, may change as time goes on. For instance, I’m a sucker for women who make me laugh. Years ago I became involved with someone who shared exactly the same sense of 

Define a good girl????? This is all a matter of perspective, plus lots of women seem to act differently to the way they are. My idea of a good girl, is someone that is kind, generous and loving. Theses types of people, let alone girls that you fancy and who fancy you are hard to find. Best not look for them, best not try to find them. Its to tough, they don’t wander around with a sign around their neck, often the good girls are right in front of you but its tough to see if you are looking or have a vision of what a good girl is. It takes time to get to know someone, people are like onions, they h 

So I’m first going to address what’s wrong with you… Are you ready? You’re looking. Seriously, it might sound weird, but when you find yourself looking for the “perfect girl” or a “good girl” or whatever, you get this notion of a person stuck in your head. You get a mental image, you get a personality all worked out, you form the “perfect girl” whether she’s perfect for you or perfect according to society. And then you try to be who you think “she” wants… Don’t just be “super nice” because you think it’ll make her stick around. You need to be you, through and through. I’ve been in the position 

How common is it for a guy to get no matches on Tinder?
If you use app everyday, your match probability will be increase because you will shown in the lists for people who are searching for a match. But if you use sometimes, your visibility will decrease and you can review my questions about Tinder to increase your Elo Score there. You can be sure, you will get many matches in short term. Tinder is an app for find quickly date so if you are complaining about matches there are somethings wrong in your profile. Because it’s the most popular dating app nowadays so you can reach people in short term(in a few weeks). These all can be a reason makes you in 

I'd say it's not uncommon. There's a fairly simple explanation for this. You say people have called you ‘cute’ and believe yourself to be a somewhat attractive guy. I'm sure this is the case (if this sounds like sarcasm, it isn’t) The problem is that a vaguely attractive girl, not even a moderately attractive one, but a vaguely attractive one, will get tons of right swipes. TONS. It's just the way the male psyche works. You'be seen this for yourself in real life. In bars and in clubs. Vaguely attractive girls get hit on a lot by virtue of being female; it's the way dating in out society is set u 

Studies show that what happens on tinder, and most dating platforms, is (roughly speaking from memory) 90% of men will swipe right on close to 100% of women. And 90% of women will swipe right on 10% of men. Then the top 10% of men will swipe right on the top 10% of women (going by percieved attractiveness) So unless you are a very attractive man, or have something about you, or many things that are attractive to women, you may not get noticed at all. It is a very skewed dating medium. Its bad for both genders too, because women inadvertantly have all the choice (as over 90% of men will match wit 

 Firstly, you should know that guys swipe right on 60%-80% of the profiles he sees but girls only 8%-15%. So if you do the math, the probability of getting a match is 😅 If you want to get more matches you need to stand out from the crowd. Here some ways to do that: Get more right swipes. Do not put a selfie, group photo, photo wearing a hat or sunglass, poor quality photo, photo with a filter or photo where your face is clearly not visible as the first photo. Always have at least 4 photos on your profile. Put variation of photos like outdoor, full-body, leisure activities….etc Contrary to the popula 

Let’s just say that it’s not uncommon for guys to get matches on tinder, but not as common as it is for women. (Tinder dynamics in India - variable from city to city) The reality is that the ratio of women to men on tinder is off the chart. Which means that for every woman on tinder there are at least 30 men. 1:30? that is appalling. So, as you can imagine women are spoilt for choice. 99% of the profiles they swipe right on match instantly, because those men have already swiped right on her. There is no effort of “waiting” or “uncertainty” involved for women. (remember tinder is a superficial pl 

When it comes to Tinder, especially for men, location and geography is immensely important. Only each individual is best judge of this one. If you live in a very high population area like LA, Seattle, DFW, Houston, Chicago, etc, the rule of thumb is your looks probably needs to be in the top 30 percentile (at least slightly above average or higher). In lower population areas, better to just swipe left on all dating apps unless you are in the top 10%. As a former user of Tinder, it all comes strictly down to numbers: Automation was used to like 90% of all profiles in my locale.Over 48 hours, I’l

Whether this is a common scenario or not, I feel, doesn't solve your problem. Understand how Tinder works. A person is presented with a tiny square on their phone, and expected to make a snap judgement. On dating sites, attractive women are bombarded with endless propositions. Men tend to "scatter shot" on these sites, hoping that 1 in 100 solicitations work. Tinder is different because she must like you before you are allowed to talk to her. Because of this, women are incredibly selective on who they will "like." An attractive woman assumes that if she likes someone on Tinder, she will automati 

The reality is you could put lipstick on a scarecrow and it/she would have dozens of likes /messages on dating sites as many men swipe right on anything female with a pulse. This then gives plain women delusions of grandeur rejecting average men thinking they can attract a combination of Bill gates/superman believing they are desirable supermodels when it’s simply how the male psyche works. The number of times I’ve seen morbidly obese females with missing teeth typing out a list of demands for their requirements of men thinking they are Miss World plastered with war paint ( makeup) and ridicul 

It’s probably a lot more common to get around 15 or so matches, and maybe 1 or 2 conversations where the girl replies to a message, and then get 0 dates from those 2 conversations. Almost like no matches, but not literally 0 matches. 0 matches seems unlikely. Regardless of you’re situation, before you get too down on yourself, you must know the facts of who uses Tinder and why:  Unfortunately, Tinder is not as advertised. Only 5% of registered users are looking to use the app for its intended function. Everyone else are just being sheeples because it’s the latest ‘cool’ thing to do, with no intenti 

Probably quite common, since dating sites, and their ‘70s predecessor, computer match, are just as effective as chance. There is no scientific basis for web-based matching. It's just the latest way to separate you from your money. A humana match-maker is more likely to provide you with a good fit, because the person actually knows the clients. Computers know only what they are told about the people who sign up. There is no way to verify the clients’ claims. Even the photos can be altered or swapped. Go to where real people are - houses of worship, musea, malls. If you frequent places you enjoy, y

Is online dating more brutal than offline dating and why?
My response will be on male perspective of online dating. I will skip the common answers and jump into something most people are not aware of. Most men find online dating brutal through personal experience. They come up with volumes of experiments and explanations. I’ve had a considerable number of years through online dating and have flown for my dates. What most men never realised is that what if their profile was not shown to the ladies they swiped right on if they were on Tinder? You can’t get a match if you were not being shown in the first place. Since there are more men using online dating 

There is a definite pseudo-science to the entire system. Some things you see first in the offline world: Looks.Height.Build.Actual human.Some things you see first in the online world. Tailored photos.Interests.Height, sometimes.Likes/dislikes.What they want out of a partnerIn the real world, there isn’t a quick check for composition of character on a person. You need to speak to them if you want to get to know them. In the real world, their appearance is one of the first things you see. You fidget just to speak to them. You’re nervous. The first time is probably the most brutal, if you subtract aw 

I met my girlfriend on OKcupid about 3 years ago. Before that, I’d been single for about 3 years, and I’d been using OKcupid for about 2 of those. I had basically exhausted my circle of friends as far as meeting available women was concerned, so online dating seemed like a viable option. Let me just say, that dating of any kind as a childfree person sucks. I’m not sure if it’s worse for childfree men or women, but it was definitely aggravating to me. 90% of the messages I received were from single mothers, even though the first line of my profile stated that I did not want children and was not  

It is depressing, degrading and pitiful. I saw a question I’m gonna answer sneer after this. It asked when you first realized you were old? When I joined a dating site. My 40’s were good to me. I felt like I was at my best in my 40’s. I felt great, had lots of energy and with the kids grown and gone I had lots of me time. I enjoyed everyday. My mother always told me “when you turn 50 it will all change”. She was wrong. I was 50 and 2 days old when I felt old. I woke up hurting. It’s been interesting ever since. But I had moved and wanted to meet people and date so I joined 2 dating sites. Omg!  

For an introverted, gamer, anime and comic fan like me who had a hard time making friends in person, online dating was a godsend. I was able to meet and connect with so many fellow “nerds” (and “blerds" in my case) online that I could relate to and have proper conversations with. We joined groups on Facebook where we like to hangout and chat for hours a day, I found out many of my online friends only lived a state or two away so we actually met up in person (after verifying they're real people through Skype and FaceTime). If you ever saw us hang out in person you would probably think we were c 

It really depends on your personality and what you’re looking for in a person. Look, if I wanted to have a boyfriend by next week, online dating would solve that problem for me. But there would be another problem: he wouldn’t be the partner that I need, as I’m childfree. I need someone who never wanted kids, and doesn’t have kids—even adult ones. That eliminates a HUGE segment of the male population right off the bat, probably at least 90 percent. Factor in intent (is he the marrying kind, or does he just want a hook-up?), attractiveness, reasonable age gaps, personality, chemistry, and general 

I think so, but it’s very gender and race-dependent. If you’re a woman and decent-looking, you’re going to have to deal with: Lots of lewd messages (especially if you signal that you’re open to non-monogamy or casual sex).lots of guys getting offended and insulting you for not replying to them or turning them down.Lots of interested guys you just feel “meh” about.Lots of idiotic one-liners like “Hey” or “What’s up?”Lots of copy-and-paste messages (more on that later).Too many damn messages of all kinds. In real life, guys at least have to deal with being embarrassed if they hit on you and you tu

I don’t really think there IS offline dating anymore. Unless you are in high school or college, or some other environment where nearly everyone is unmarried and close to your age. I read some (not all) of the other answers and they each seemed to have something to say about online dating, in many cases how brutal it was, but few had anything specific to say about offline dating. Because no one does it anymore. I once observed an exchange in a public space with lots of young people, a place where you might expect to meet someone, as much as any place in the offline world anymore, where a man appr 

I don’t think it’s actually more brutal than offline dating, I think it’s just that some guys expect it be easier online when it’s really not. A big part of online dating is your looks and the quality of the profile you write (for websites like okcupid, etc.). When you are dating online a strong profile comes from having funny things to say, having relateable interests, etc. Even if there are only pictures there are ways for girls to judge your non-looks attractiveness by checking if you have pictures with other girls (a vibrant social life), doing interesting things (so you are interesting guy 

As someone who personally is sensitive to rejection, I find it more emotionally taxing.  In person, you can get a sense for the level of attraction and chemistry between you and another, and there is more of a requirement for the receiver of your interest to respond to you as a fellow human being.  Basically, there's less need to take emotional risks unnecessarily, less risk of the other person being entirely non-responsive to the risks you take, less opportunity for communication errors, and less of a dent in your overall morale based on the amount of time you're sinking into the notion of se 

Why do older men on dating sites, such as on match.com, refuse to date women their own age?
Dating sites are generally superficial.. you have a lot of data to work with and the easiest way to narrow down your choices is to first filter out gender-biased attributes of attractiveness.. Not all men refuse to date women their own age. In my late 20’s I fell for my boss who was 49. He ended up dumping me for his ex who was much closer to his age. They’ve been together for the past 10 years. He thought he wanted a young woman w a young body but in the long-run, the reality of the everyday set in.. He used to tell me that a man is as young as the woman he’s banging.. (yes, charming ;) He alread 

For the same reason women on dating sites refuse to date men their own height, income, and social-status. Interestingly enough, the same women who ask this question (usually posed as a judgment e..g ‘why can’t men handle women their own age?’) have height, income and career requirements. Just like they had when they were in their teens, 20,s, 30x, and 40s. It is simply part of the paradigm between men and women. Women rejected only 1/2 of it with ‘liberation’ so ask questions like this. Be it why men date younger women or calling out men who don’t like ‘larger’ women. As I see it if my role is 

I edited my answer, I copied/pasted a letter from Yahoo, from a writer:“When I was 19, I met a man who lied to me about his age. He said was he was 38, but he was actually 41. Some of you may be shocked by the 38 bit, let alone the over 40 bit. But I was cool with it. My own father had recently left our home for another woman, so I was looking for a father figure, not a young boy. I’m now the age he was when we started dating, and my step son is the age I was. And I can see now, so very clearly, what a power imbalance that was. The lie about his age was the first red flag I should have heeded; bu 

It’s just biology, and no amount of ideology will fundamentally change the facts on the ground: what men are genetically-wired to find attractive in women are the physical manifestations of fecundability (fertility). Of those traits that suggest fertility, the primary one among women is youth, and then of course a set of secondary characteristics such as facial symmetry, long flowing hair, feminine face, etc…(i.e., “looks’). What women look for are telltales of dominance and “ambition,” because the more dominant men can provide for her and her offspring in a superior fashion, and they also len 

While both sexes are guilty of being shallow when it comes to looks, it is generally accepted that men are more looks driven than women. Based on my experiences and readings, I generally believe this, but I do think women are not too far behind, it just gets noticed less. Many women and men past 40 seem to get a rougher, more grizzled appearance, as well as a deeper voice for some. Unfortunately, this ends up make certain older women a bit masculine or aged, which is a major turnoff to guys. Its also around the 30s-40s that many people become more laid-back, thoughtful, and more set in their wa 

I am 37 and my girlfriend is almost exactly one decade younger (27). We have a long-term relationship that is going well. My last few, more short-term, dating adventures were with women of similar ages, but in certain cases I certainly wouldn't rule out older women. Like you say, they could be Halle Berry!  Sure, okay, I'd date her. If you're gonna force my hand.   But then again, she looks 25 or 30. The most basic reason why men have long (perhaps forever) preferred younger women is that men are, with thoughtful exceptions, hard-wired to seek out women who look to be at optimal fertility. Female 

Only and only when an older man can say I don’t care and mean it, will he find a peaceful path concerning dating women. I am over 65 and retired but I feel 40 on the inside. I was married for 28 years. After my divorce I felt like the lid had been taken off the pressure cooker. Totally at peace and looking forward to my new life. It was not a hateful divorce as we both filled our roles in the marriage, she raised 3 fabulous kids and I worked hard having to travel a lot for an International Company. The fact that I was on the road 50% of the time probably kept our marriage on track. However, I  

I was talking to a friend of mine, who’s a few years older than me, about this a while back. He said “I can’t date women my age, they’re too old”. I looked at him for a minute, silently indicating “and you’re not?” which he eventually picked up on and elaborated. “No, not that. They’re just in a different place than me. They want to retire and crochet and garden and travel and shit. I’ve got two startups and I’m on the board of a couple of non-profits, and I have my 100-mile biking group, and fuck, man, I’m busy. I can’t just decide that because it’s Wednesday to we should spend the day in Napa o 

I'm a 24 year old woman on Match(dot)com. I've never been in a relationship with a older guy. I get rejected by older men all the time. : ( I don't know why? I'm authentic, compassionate and loving. I want to find a right guy. I want to know what I am doing wrong? I’m open to any feedback. I get rejected for following reason (I think): 1) I like dating older guys because they are very confident, they know what they want out of life. So, they are willing to put equal amount of emotional investment in a relationship as me. I like that. 2) I don't mind making compromises for the sake of love. I'm very  

It’s true; it would seem that men find younger women more attractive - specifically, women in the prime of their fertility, younger than 35 years old. Hell, if I could have my own way, I’d only have sex with men who were in their twenties. Having sex with a man any older than that is, quite frankly, disgusting to me. But we all have to contend with reality. What’s the reality? How many women at this point in time are in their twenties? They have men in their twenties vying for their attention, as well as men in their thirties vying for their attention, not to mention men in their forties and up

What made you stop using dating sites?
I stopped temporarily because it was turning out to be a huge waste of my time. If you’re a straight male on a dating site like OKCupid, the odds are stacked against you. It’s extremely common for women to receive tons of messages each day, while it can take months for men to get any messages. Most messages written by men do not receive replies, even if they are thoughtful, personalized and well-written. After a while of receiving no replies after putting in so much effort, you tend to get discouraged and feel like your time could have been better spent on other things. I still use dating sites 

Well, the real reason is because I have a boyfriend now, of two years. However right before I met him, I came thisclose to retiring from OLD completely. Here's why: The older you get (an over 40 woman CAN be positively geriatric in online dating) the slimmer the pickings are. I got tired of seeing the same 10 or 20 people pop up, over and over again in my matches or searches. I consider myself fairly attractive as do others, I don't look like I'm in my 40s, in fact, some people have mistaken my oldest daughter as my little sister. But, the minute these guys would see my age…crickets. Even the m 

I found my sweetheart online and that's why I stopped using dating sites. There are things to understand about dating sites and one big one is understanding that it is not putting an order in at a fast food restaurant and getting what you wanted quickly. Another big one is that the majority of messages you get on the dating site will be scammers. At least the free ones. I didn't utilize any of the paid dating sites but I would imagine they have scammers also. They're called catfish by some. Thirdly dating is work whether it's in reality or online you have to be willing to put in the time and ef 

Well, the first two women I talked to tried to scam money out of me. Then there were the women who were 30 pounds heavier and 15 years older than their online photos. And don’t get me started on the women who lied about their age. Finally, there were the angry, arrogant women who could not begin to understand who there really were. Unpleasant experiences one and all. However, hope springs eternal. In September I met a wonderful woman from one of the online sites. We have been going out ever since. It is still too early to tell what our long term future might be, but I hope we spend the rest of  

My experience was recent and is pretty close to Colin's except instead of women, it was the men. I don't know or even care about statistics, but being in my mid 50’s out of the loop since late 80′s early 90’s it reminded me of the old meat market bars (is that term still used?) except you don't have a buzz to make it a little more tolerable, no one buys me a drink, or vise versa, and nearly all of them appeared to be in mid life crises! Nearly every single one had a picture of themselves and there Harley Davidson! Ughhh….. been there, was married to that, and staying single started looking a l 

Wow, it’s been a while, but I think I have the perspective to answer this. I’m comfortable using technology for a lot of things—to have my food and groceries delivered, conduct my banking, make hotel reservations, and buy Nanette Lepore suits that I don’t need from Poshmark. I was always highly uncomfortable using technology to help me find a prospective marriage partner. The stats on this were simply not there to indicate that OLD was a fruitful way to pass my free time. But what actually put me off—? Hard to articulate this. Starting with the downside to being a communications grad: all of the 

Mostly because guys there are not looking for a real life relationship. They just want to chat online or create some fantasy to get their rocks off. And on some sites there are a lot of foreigners or scammers who are just trying to get money. As a woman, you have to be cautious and not too trusting. There are plenty of stories about dating online that go horribly wrong. Sometimes women get hurt emotionally when they talk to someone for a long time (weeks, months, years) who turns out to be a different person than what is listed in the profile. And a woman can run the risk of getting hurt physi 

Because I met my soul mate, so I stopped using sites/apps. In my case, I went with the personality and interest as a first. Photos were not a huge part of my reasons to write back. I was surprised to find I found my partner a whole lot more physically attractive after we met in person. Pictures didn’t portray any emotional connection that I got through a date. We met on 123Date app. While I think online dating is way less nervous than traditional way. I think we all need communication skills and online dating helps to acquire it. If you learn some simple rules of online dating then you will certa 

The multitude of scammers that the dating sites do nothing about. Most of the profiles are fake. The multitude of children on dating sites. You would think the parents would know better but obviously they don't. The constant bombardment of inappropriate pictures sent without consent. Not enough filters so it's easier to find what you're looking for. Example, race, distance, interests, body type… POF purposely changes the distance you're looking for so you can't find anyone. It's a lot better to get very few good results then hundreds of bad results. Dating sites are loaded with ex-convicts, pedophi

It was the first time they seen people from the suburbs lined up in cities buying heroin. They are targeting people.

No a bio, but one of Tinder’s own initiatives made me feel a little sick. Tinder Menprovement   Most men are good. But then there are douchebags who ruin it for everyone. So the women of Tinder are on a mission to make calling them out easy and fun.

A2A “Have you ever come across a Tinder bio that made you cringe?” Way too many to really keep track of. Examples? This is going to make me wildly unpopular. But as a straight male, these make me cringe.  Look, more power to you for embracing your feminine soul or anything else you may attribute it to. I don’t stand in the way of want you want, but it isn’t going to stop me from cringing when I see it on the dating app. It’s just a truth of preference. I am sure the right man is out there for you and you are searching, again, all the power to you. This about what makes me cringe and nothing to do wi 

Goodness, yes. I can recall a few, but some definitely stood out and a couple I actually had to get a screen shot to show my friend because they were just…ugh. Also, I later saw this guy in person (NOT an arranged meeting, he just happened to come into my place of employment at the time) and he had most definitely used pictures that portrayed him at only his best angles-none of which I was able to find when looking at him (it took me a moment to realize why he looked familiar). I knew it was the same guy due to some distinctive jewelery.  It's NOT okay to omit apostrophes. This just screams “tota 

Bragging About Mental Illness  I’m not even going to go into the way this offends mentally ill people, because honestly I don’t care about that. What I am going to do is tell you that if a woman ADMITS to having a mental disorder and brags about it, then you should fucking run. Do you really think she isn’t going to take it out on you? I assume most people who seek out Tinder dates are doing so because they want to avoid toxic or unhappy relationships. So why fall right back down the rabbit-hole? Cringe Bio Or Cringe Person?  This girl is my age, and she’s already looking to settle. Never mind the fa 

When I got divorced and decided to try dating apps and being totally clues about all of them, someone recommended tinder. So I'm like okay bet, let me try it. So after maybe an hour after joing the site I git a message from a guy who wanted to go iut with me. Just looking at the picture I knew something was creepy about him. He was really cute but he had that american psycho look about him. Long story longer, I look at his profile bust out how dude was a kinky and in to S and M being dominated and stuff. He wanted to have someone put him on a leash and walk him like a dog, ccause he was a bad b 

19/20 – 39/40 Tinder profiles made me cringe. When I was active on Tinder I actively lost more and more hope in humanity. The absolute majority of female (as in meaning both girls and women, not as in 'me caveman, must call women female, ugg!') profiles were very cringy. I tried to decipher the Tinder culture. Was I expected to be this cringy and embarassing too? Is this how people present themselves in the dating scene in general these days? Should someone mix enormous amounts of botuline toxin in all water supply world wide? Should I start dating dudes instead since almost all these people seem 

Tinder recently added a feature that let users include videos to their profiles. They look like Boomerangs from Instagram. They may be the same thing. Basically, they’re short videos that loop and have no sound. Here is a Boomerang I recently took while at a football game. &nbsp;0:00-0:30 Example of a Boomerang So, you can include those on profiles now. I haven’t seen many, but one stuck out to me. The profile was a guy who obviously liked working out, perhaps a bit too much. His bio included something about the gym, even though his photos made it too obvious. Anyway, his video was of him in underwear grabbing his  

I do have screenshots of these, but I think I'll spare these lovely ladies of the public humiliation. First pic is of her flipping the bird to Trump Tower — bio contained “#AntiFa” - well I can already predict our first conversation.“Lets get together and pray to Daddy Corbyn” — support him or not, Daddy fetishising him might be a little bit far.“Swipe left if you're a tory” — BECAUSE I REFUSE TO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH MEAge-18, Bio: “Full time mummy of three” — This definitely bodes well for the future“Not looking for another fuckboy” — At least we know you're a good decision maker.“

Does OkCupid count too? The following is a screenshot from a guy who gave me a “like”, which I was able to see cause I'm too curious to not pay for that feature.  I don't mind if you have preferences, and everyone has certain standards. That's totally fine! But the above requirements sound like he's looking for some kind of fairytale. What's worse, that guy had the typical super boring bio (“I like food and traveling”), and appeared to not be objectively attractive from his badly taken pictures (I tend to differentiate between “attractive to me” and “not attractive to me, but likely to others”). S 

I’ve seen my fair share of cringy Tinder bios from women: ‘looking for a daddy’, ‘meth wiz’, ‘in town for two days, down for anyone without STDs’, just to name a few. I’m hoping that last one is a joke… But, without fail, I have to say the worst time reading bios was when a female friend let me look in on her Tinder experience. My God, men, what the hell are we doing? No dumb joke or trashy ‘I want a sugar daddy’ post could make me cringe as much as the stuff I saw on regular blokes’ profiles. ‘My annual salary is higher than your IQ, girl.’ ‘If you can’t deal with a man who loves his car more t 

Is Tinder a place for creeps?
I think it depends on where you are. I am a man. I live in Japan and got on tinder after breakup with my wife about a year ago. Majority of the women on tinder seem to be there for “pure” reasons. All say no ONS / Hookups on their profile. 99.9% say no married men, please swipe left. I clearly wrote that I am technically married but estranged. I do not get a lot of matches, but more than I can keep up with in terms of replying, and all of them said no married men, but seem to somehow ignore the fact that I am married. I met a few of them in person, they were not creeps. They were mostly just look 

I just spotted this and wanted to share my story. I’ll set the scene; It’s May 2017, your gal is currently struggling to make rent payments on a tiny room in Oxford, despite working a minimum of 50 hours a week managing a busy pub. Surrounded by wonderful friends, of course, but still drowning in a big, ol’, nasty puddle of disappointment. My boyfriend of almost 4 years had disappeared back to his home country, with almost no warning signs. And I mean we’re talking here one week, not here the next. I was almost 27, him almost 30, we had talked about our future. Maybe it was silly of me to think  

I had my first #metoo moment through someone I met on Tinder. It was horrible. The guys first of all had edited his pics, I think used a filter, it made him look 10 times better than in real life. He asked me on text messaging if I want to get into anything, I said we’ll see how it goes, but at that point I wasn’t keen and all I wanted was to meet someone new, have company for coffee as I was in a new city. We met for coffee. Turns out he’s very right wing and I’m extremely liberal. Had a semi-heated argument over politics. He said come to my place, it’s nearby, I resisted but like an idiot went 

I’m going to say “No” to this question. And here’s why: I have used Tinder in the past, and I don’t think I’m creepy….or I’m in denial…. In fact, I met a wonderful man on Tinder. It’s 2016 and I had just gotten out of rehab for an opioid addiction, which is a whole other story. Me and my then husband had filed for divorce in the past and had not been close, much less friendly to each other, in some years. The final straw was when he told me, the night before rehab (he had been smoking crack), that he wished I was going to jail instead of rehab. He knew I was serious about getting clean and knew I 

Tinder is a place for creeps the same way as any real-life circumstance involving a large gathering of people is a place for creeps. You’ll find a large sample of people from the most shy to the dick pic sending type. On a crowded subway or in a crowded mall you’ll likely find the same people you’d find on Tinder. I find it hilarious that people have prejudice against Tinder while hoping to meet a mate in a bar/party spot or randomly on the street. I’ve talked to a lot of women on Tinder and had some moderate success while not being a chad. As a guy, you gotta filter out the ones who are just s 

Unfortunately Tinder is a place for everyone. Guys who wouldn’t normally expose themselves in public will do it via SMS, snapchat, or whatsapp if they can hold in their urges long enough to get that far. A lot of people have repressed sexual frustration and they take it out on others who use these apps. I’m sure that there have been hundreds of thousands of men banned on Tinder for being disgusting. In a past life I actually worked for Tinder as a software engineer. I did not gather statistics on these kinds of people, but I have seen millions of profiles. I personally prefer Bumble now because 

I just received this post in my digest and I want to share a little bit about my past experience with Tinder as well as my exposure to creeps on the platform. The definition of a creep is a detestable person deserving of intense dislike. So we begin. My experience with dating apps has been somewhat involved. I worked for a major dating website right out of college and I have seen substantial inappropriate behavior. I would label about one in fifty people true “creeps”. One of my positions held was quality assurance and as such, I would routinely read message threads that were flagged by users.  

Well, if the world is filled with creeps, how can tinder be left behind? Bored and curious on an unproductive weekend in Calcutta (India), I tried the tinder experiment. Additional info: I had an ugly breakup the previous month. Hence, a little compliment and attention from the other sex wouldn't hurt my already massacred self esteem. Background: I am 25, skinny, fair, people pass me off as an attractive girl. I chose a few pictures put an quirky bio and bam, anyone I swiped right replied in seconds. Most of these men claimed to be from premier institutions (IIT, NIT, IIM, ISB, and the likes) dra 

The answer is highly subjective and really depends on what the user expects. Guys will have to send a lot of messages, and most importantly know how to interact virtually. If (and its a big if) they get responses from women and land dates they mostly expect that the person they meet will be who they thought they met online. More than half of the dates I have had through dating apps have been catfishing attempts. Usually it becomes obvious their pictures were taken when they didnt have the extra 100 pounds they now carry. To me this is rather creepy to have happen, which means from my experience 

Yes. So are all other dating sites, so is the local supermarket, library, speed dating events, pubs, clubs etc. Creeps are creeps and sadly they live among us. The internet and social media just gives them a touch of anonymity to enable them to be creeps. Face to face if they flashed their penis they would get arrested at worst or a slap at best. Over dating apps etc its common and what can anyone do other than block you? If you say something inappropriate to a woman in public, again its public so you are likely to get a drink thrown in your face or someone pointing out your behaviour sucks. Ov 

Why do Tinder matches not message?
This may be long. I'm going to say something that men aren't supposed to say. BECAUSE WE'RE TIRED OF NOT GETTING REPLIES. Why aren't we supposed to say that? Because it suggests a lack of confidence and self esteem, and as we all know, that's one of the leading factors of attractiveness to a woman. In fact, just saying that almost made me want to go anonymous, but I'm not a sissy. I'm also going to say things here that nobody is "supposed" to say, so as not to sound shallow. But first I'll say this - There is a question here on Quora, asking everyone to rate themselves based on physical appearance 

Here is the cold, hard truth… …they do not find you attractive enough! At least if compared to the amount of time, commitment and giving up on other potential partners necessary, you are not. Your pictures simply did not leave a deep enough impression, did not cause enough excitement, did not awaken their inner sexual animal. Your opener did not make it past the threshhold of interest, causing them to stop whatever they were doing to invest time and energy into a conversation with you. Remember: A person who is sufficiently hot for you will crawl over broken glass and rusty barbed wire to be with  

In my region, most of the girls I matched on Tinder would only have their Instagram IDs in the bio (sometimes with an ‘explanation’ like I don’t get on here a lot so follow and message me on IG). It’s easy to figure that they just want to recruit IG followers. And I have no interest in adding myself to that desperate pool.Sometimes I’d match girls with no bio at all, just their faces and bodies from different angles. In the beginning, I’d try to compliment their beautiful exteriors without anything else to play off of, and I’d either get no reply or receive a hookup request that is obviously a

Ah Tinder, dating in the “new age”… Ever since I was… well, alive and attracted to boys (especially beginning those last couple years until… well, now… 20 years later) I have often done the duty of stepping up and asking for a date. Once or twice, it worked in my favor. But in these “later” (why does this age thing matter so much? I don’t give a damn that I'm a 30-something single woman, do you?) years, it seems to be working against me. Take this new-fangled date finding device: tinder. The “hot or not” for the dating/hooking up/polyamory partner seeking/I want to cheat on my wife…?!?! WHAT? (No 

Seeing as you’re a woman, I’ll answer from a guy’s point of view on Tinder. When I match with someone, I let that match sit dormant for about a day or so. The only exception would be if we had mutual friends, then I’d wait about 6 hours then reach out. Why wait? Well for starters, there are a LOT of fake/advertising accounts on Tinder. Some are obvious others are not as obvious. But typically after 12–18hrs they’re flagged then removed from Tinder. If we have mutual friend why wait 6-hours? Well there are a lot of mistake swipes. It happens when such a black and white selection system, and it  

Well, firstly, I don’t message because I know that, as a girl, some, if not many, guys swipe right without even looking and then choose girls out of the ones they matched with. It makes the entire tinder process counterproductive. The intention was that, once you are matched, you’re sure both of you are interested in each other. Because guys, and some girls, just swipe right like it’s a thumb exercise, it’s unclear if the guy matched with you because he’s interested or if he just wants to see his options. Another reason, as a girl, why I don’t ANSWER to guys that talk to me is, when I was lookin 

I’m answering as if a male asked this but it goes for females too. There could be 1,000 reasons why they don’t message you. They’re too busy to message every single person that sends a message to them.They’re only casually looking at their app.They could be incredibly shy and freeze at the thought of messaging back.They only message those that they’re interested in.etc, etc etc.But the real kicker is that if someone is 100% invested and interested, they will message back. Is that upsetting? Does that make you angry? It shouldn’t. If someone’s not interested, that’s that. Pick up that fragile ego  

Coz Tinder doesn’t work for guys.Have you tried selling something in demand on facebook marketplace? You are flooded with messages. You select whoever is paying the most and want to get it out of your hands asap right? Well, that’s kind of place of how Tinder works for above average looking women. They are bombarded all the time by guys who wants to get their *ick wet. You being another one of them will not work coz you will be associated as “loser”. The simplest way to get what you want in life is go and ask for it. That boldness and going for what you want is very attractive to women. So, if  

I think the implicit question here is: “why match if you’re not going to talk?” I think the answer is that people only put very slight thought into the matching part; starting a conversation requires more thought, and sometimes people won’t make the effort because they’re busy (or already talking to someone else they like), and sometimes they’ll think a bit harder and decide they’re not that interested after all. This goes both ways. I send messages that don’t get replies. This has been true throughout my history of online dating, which goes back to a site my friend wrote in the late nineties. T 

As a woman, it’s because we have a lot of matches and often forget who was who, we might not be bothered to go through the matches to remember who it was we really liked and who we didn’t, we don’t want to look too keen messaging first. We might have only been on there, swiping and looking, for the vapid fun of it, and also we don’t message or reply because the small talk or the ‘pick up line’ game is dull and so overall Tinder quickly becomes a drag. My boyfriend told me that men don’t message because they don’t like you. Men often swipe right on everyone and then only message the girls they a 

What are some deal-breakers or major turnoffs that men see in women's online dating profiles?
A few, I will try and list them in order from most egregious to mild annoyance along with the rationale. Nothing: There seems to be a massive amount of people who don’t have anything in their profiles. Rationale: Probably just looking for an ego boost, and probably wont respond at all.People who only write: “How do people know how to write these things?”… (similar to above but different): A:We think and then we write, pretty simple eh? Rationale: I am either going to assume you are an idiot, shy, arrogant, lazy or just a moron. You don’t want to start with someone trying figure out what is wron

I love this question. I try to keep a really open mind but these ones drive me especially bonkers. These aren’t deal breakers, more like just WTF’s. Jesus / God comes first. Only because they list they are fine dating an atheist. My kids come first and are my entire life. We know, I have kids, they obviously come first. You only have to put you have kids for someone to know this. Separately if they are literally your entire life, how are you going to make emotional and physical space to share your life with someone else? Again, I’m a single parent who has custody about 90% of the time so I have  

I did online dating a few years ago, now I am engage, so online does work but it does take effort. However, one of the biggest deal-breakers for me was If I saw the following in one form or another on a person’s profile; I tell it like it is, or I am brutally honest, and most often it was followed with a..wanting no drama.The first shows a lack good communication. When people are “Telling like it is” or “are being brutally honest” it is a form of an insult that is a guise in honesty. They believe otherwise it would be sugar coating it. This mentality is very destructive in communication. The be 

In my brief attempt at online dating, I used Okcupid on my laptop. So keep that in mind. My major turnoffs in online dating profiles include: Nothing on your profile: This includes no pictures, nothing in the “about me” section, a one-sentence description, or a bunch of emojis. It just communicates to me that you’re not serious. It also tells me that I can expect one-word, or one-sentence responses to my messages (another deal-breaker for me)Ambiguous pictures: By this I mean you have a picture of something other than you, a quote, meme, or a fuzzy picture, or one not showing your face. Only on

For me at least: Grammar.“Wil luv u 4ever if u no wat I mean so idk hmu. ttyl,”Wow. That’s certainly the sexiest thing that I’ve ever heard.

I recently started online dating…and I’m a woman seeking other women so I’m not quite the target audience for the question but being so new to the world there are tons of things I notice about women’s profiles that really turn me off. And my insights might be useful since a lot of these things would probably bother men too. Negative profiles listing everything you don’t want, don’t like and what people shouldn’t be…so obnoxious. I understand this world can make people kind of hardened and cynical and what not, but law of attraction 101 here…if all you’re focusing on is what you don’t want, how  

Only been using it just over 2 months, this is a 1st for me as the last time I was single was 10 years ago almost, that was during the VHS dating era (thank god that doesn’t exist anymore). Too many snapchat filters.We cannot see your face for what it is, Alot of the time you do not always look cute in it. It is a dating app you are not supposed to cover your entire face in emojis or alter your appearence with airbrush or warping.Group photos without you being on your own in one of themWe do not know which one is you unless you have an isolated photo of yourself at least once.If you do have an 

I tried a couple of online dating apps, including tinder, a while ago and a few things are an immediate turn off: Boring “likes” There are so many profiles I see on tinder where women list “food” as a thing they like. No really, you like food? Gosh, so do I! So much in common. If you live in Oxford, you tend to see “gin” listed as an interest over and over as well. Great, you drink alcohol. Very exciting. What next, breathing? Actually, sarcasm aside, I would be cool to meet a woman who did have a really deep and passionate interest in things like food or gin; such as if they were big into the sc 

Most of them are already mentioned in the answers but I'm going to write my own list anyway. If the profile says shit like Just looking for friends, No hookups, Don't message if you don't like dogs, etc. I immediately swipe left.Honestly, the dog and cats shit is out of hand. Look, I get it, you love your pets. But saying, “ If you don't like dogs don't swipe left” or “I love my dog more than you” or “ Message me only if you have a cute dog”, is only going to repel men. I don't like having pets, but I will tolerate a dog. What I don't like is a crazy pet lady, I have seen profiles in which wome

What is your weirdest experience on Tinder?
Omg… so this is all sorts of Alice in the rabbit hole strange but here goes: After a stretch of a year of celibacy after my LtR of 3 years I decided to put myself back on the market. My situation is a peculiar one in being that I’m a pre-op trans woman, not a negative whatsoever in my book but I understand not a flavor for most men. I decided just in a spin, Tinder, heard the name commonly among friends, figured why not. I honestly didn’t expect to to really find the love of my life, let alone a date, or casual sex but more so like a little sociology experiment. The first liner after my header 

I made an account on tinder in July 2019 while I had a sleepover at my friend’s place. I am single and I am not interested in anyone so my friend was like lets try tinder. I was like okay. i made an account and she told me how to use it and then fast forward I started talking to a guy he was from the same city as I am and I live in Pakistan my city is very small mostly people know each other and somehow he knew my family. we started talking on Snapchat first and then on phone calls. We started talking alot like hours on phone. And then he asked me to meet up I was a bit worried what if someone s 

Can’t imagine many people will read this answer but I have to mention an unforgettable experience I had once using Tinder. I remember matching with her and I was surprised when she replied to me because from her display picture she was stunningly gorgeous. After a period of friendly banter I trusted the girl to be a real life person. I was shocked when she invited me to what she called a secret masquerade ball. She mentioned that she could get me and my friends free wrist bands and VIP access. When finding the girl on Instagram to show my buds she came up with over 10k followers. I was impressed 

I had one and only one Tinder date (in three months). That was my first and last time using it. This was two years ago, I was 51 &amp; had lost my wife to complications from cancer (she had a heart attack after getting hooked on OxyContin in treatment &amp; trying to quit cold turkey) the year before. I met this woman who was supposedly in her early 40’s, but looked 10–15 years younger (I didn’t think anything about it because my family are like that. I got carded to buy cigarettes and beer until my late 40’s since I look (or did then) a lot younger than I am myself. NOT saying I’m good-looking or wha 

He lived local and seemed really sweet…something I soon found out not to be quite the truth. I had been sending messages back and forth to Jay for a week or so during which time I found out he was 36, he lived above one of the local pubs and had 4 children. He'd asked me out for a drink but I already had plans that night to go out with my best friend. He was still eager to meet and invited us both for a drink with him. She agreed we could meet him for a couple of hours so I told my friend that if I used the phrase “I bloody well need the loo" instead of just saying “I'm just going to the loo” i 

25th June  26th June was the last day i texted her or received  I am about to share one more experience i had the chance to live. Thanks to tinder. It was during my first year and i was in the middle of moving on. It was my perspective then. It was good in the beginning but didn't end well. It was a false alarm . I met a girl. She was pursuing ca and she belonged to Kolkata. I was in Kolkata when i matched with her but i didn't text. I usually do but maybe that time i was busy. So one day i was in my hometown and she texted me. She was cute short height and she wore spects.. I imagined a lot of things  

Well I think this is rather strange. We matched, chatted online for a bit, confirmed we both preferred red wine to white. Met in town planning to watch the light festival (Oulu, Finland) but only drank instead. Planned next date where I would come around to her place and we would cook together. Her place because she had a sauna and I didn’t. She also warned me her dog was a very suspicious type, but cat was friendly to all. So I arrived, spoke politest dog to dog who growled at first, but I had him lying on his back exposing belly after 5 minutes. As planned we (I) cooked, then went for the sauna 

After matching on Tinder, I began to message with a girl named Kristi. The conversation was great and we decided to meet. She suggested a double date with a couple. We all met for dinner. The other couple, Jenna and Michael, seemed very nice. The guy and I hit it off and we had a great conversation about music. My date seemed cool, intelligent and was very attractive. After the date, I mentioned via text that Michael and I seemed to hit it off. “Jenna is sick of him,” my date said. “She is planning on dumping him.” Weird, I thought. It was a bit of a shock because I liked the Michael guy. I had h 

I frequent Tinder to have a good laugh with my friends. My female friends and I will often sit together and swipe through, showing off any goofy, funny, or interesting profiles we happen to find. We would sometimes screenshot notable profiles to send in our group chat. Men, just to let you know, we roast your profiles harshly and swipe left the overwhelming majority of the time. So, if you don’t get many matches compared to your “swipe right” ratio, know that women tend to swipe left a lot. Anyway, back when I was a freshman in college (last year), I matched with another freshman. His name was * 

My best friend was on Tinder and decided to meet up with this young lad she had been messaging. It was meant to be a very relaxed hang out and he was to basically tag along at the bar with us two. He got there and instantly decided he hated me (I guess cause I was ‘third-wheeling’ their date - she wanted me there incase he was a creep). He was incredibly rude to me all night, which obviously didn’t go down well with my mate as we were really close so it was important anyone she was to date would like me too or at least have enough common decency to treat me with respect and be polite! Anyway, h

What happened on your Tinder date?
Is Tinder a place for creeps?
I think it depends on where you are. I am a man. I live in Japan and got on tinder after breakup with my wife about a year ago. Majority of the women on tinder seem to be there for “pure” reasons. All say no ONS / Hookups on their profile. 99.9% say no married men, please swipe left. I clearly wrote that I am technically married but estranged. I do not get a lot of matches, but more than I can keep up with in terms of replying, and all of them said no married men, but seem to somehow ignore the fact that I am married. I met a few of them in person, they were not creeps. They were mostly just look 

I just spotted this and wanted to share my story. I’ll set the scene; It’s May 2017, your gal is currently struggling to make rent payments on a tiny room in Oxford, despite working a minimum of 50 hours a week managing a busy pub. Surrounded by wonderful friends, of course, but still drowning in a big, ol’, nasty puddle of disappointment. My boyfriend of almost 4 years had disappeared back to his home country, with almost no warning signs. And I mean we’re talking here one week, not here the next. I was almost 27, him almost 30, we had talked about our future. Maybe it was silly of me to think  

I had my first #metoo moment through someone I met on Tinder. It was horrible. The guys first of all had edited his pics, I think used a filter, it made him look 10 times better than in real life. He asked me on text messaging if I want to get into anything, I said we’ll see how it goes, but at that point I wasn’t keen and all I wanted was to meet someone new, have company for coffee as I was in a new city. We met for coffee. Turns out he’s very right wing and I’m extremely liberal. Had a semi-heated argument over politics. He said come to my place, it’s nearby, I resisted but like an idiot went 

I’m going to say “No” to this question. And here’s why: I have used Tinder in the past, and I don’t think I’m creepy….or I’m in denial…. In fact, I met a wonderful man on Tinder. It’s 2016 and I had just gotten out of rehab for an opioid addiction, which is a whole other story. Me and my then husband had filed for divorce in the past and had not been close, much less friendly to each other, in some years. The final straw was when he told me, the night before rehab (he had been smoking crack), that he wished I was going to jail instead of rehab. He knew I was serious about getting clean and knew I 

Tinder is a place for creeps the same way as any real-life circumstance involving a large gathering of people is a place for creeps. You’ll find a large sample of people from the most shy to the dick pic sending type. On a crowded subway or in a crowded mall you’ll likely find the same people you’d find on Tinder. I find it hilarious that people have prejudice against Tinder while hoping to meet a mate in a bar/party spot or randomly on the street. I’ve talked to a lot of women on Tinder and had some moderate success while not being a chad. As a guy, you gotta filter out the ones who are just s 

Unfortunately Tinder is a place for everyone. Guys who wouldn’t normally expose themselves in public will do it via SMS, snapchat, or whatsapp if they can hold in their urges long enough to get that far. A lot of people have repressed sexual frustration and they take it out on others who use these apps. I’m sure that there have been hundreds of thousands of men banned on Tinder for being disgusting. In a past life I actually worked for Tinder as a software engineer. I did not gather statistics on these kinds of people, but I have seen millions of profiles. I personally prefer Bumble now because 

I just received this post in my digest and I want to share a little bit about my past experience with Tinder as well as my exposure to creeps on the platform. The definition of a creep is a detestable person deserving of intense dislike. So we begin. My experience with dating apps has been somewhat involved. I worked for a major dating website right out of college and I have seen substantial inappropriate behavior. I would label about one in fifty people true “creeps”. One of my positions held was quality assurance and as such, I would routinely read message threads that were flagged by users.  

Well, if the world is filled with creeps, how can tinder be left behind? Bored and curious on an unproductive weekend in Calcutta (India), I tried the tinder experiment. Additional info: I had an ugly breakup the previous month. Hence, a little compliment and attention from the other sex wouldn't hurt my already massacred self esteem. Background: I am 25, skinny, fair, people pass me off as an attractive girl. I chose a few pictures put an quirky bio and bam, anyone I swiped right replied in seconds. Most of these men claimed to be from premier institutions (IIT, NIT, IIM, ISB, and the likes) dra 

The answer is highly subjective and really depends on what the user expects. Guys will have to send a lot of messages, and most importantly know how to interact virtually. If (and its a big if) they get responses from women and land dates they mostly expect that the person they meet will be who they thought they met online. More than half of the dates I have had through dating apps have been catfishing attempts. Usually it becomes obvious their pictures were taken when they didnt have the extra 100 pounds they now carry. To me this is rather creepy to have happen, which means from my experience 

Yes. So are all other dating sites, so is the local supermarket, library, speed dating events, pubs, clubs etc. Creeps are creeps and sadly they live among us. The internet and social media just gives them a touch of anonymity to enable them to be creeps. Face to face if they flashed their penis they would get arrested at worst or a slap at best. Over dating apps etc its common and what can anyone do other than block you? If you say something inappropriate to a woman in public, again its public so you are likely to get a drink thrown in your face or someone pointing out your behaviour sucks. Ov

If countries had Tinder profiles, I am pretty sure international diplomacy would become madness on toast. Secret crushes and age-old grievances between exes surfacing, while countries are swiping left and right. That would be rather ghastly. Or fun, who knows?

What are five reasons that people should not date you?
It’s been eons since I’ve last post an answer on Quora as I’m mainly a Quoran Lurker now lol but meh, I can sacrifice 40 minutes to jog all this down. ^.^ I'M ASEXUAL! Yep! People like me do exist which so many refuse to acknowledge being that I'm only part of the 1% of the Global Population that is Ace. Cut that in half by the female population, I would be considered as rare as a 4′4 person or just a person that has a rare form of dwarfism. If you're a guy (I'm Gay btw), that has a high sex drive, keep driving to the next Sonic Pit Stop because I'm not interested in sucking your Peacock or you  

These are in no particular order. I’m short-tempered. Everyone who knows me can attest to this. I have a short fuse, and it doesn’t take very much to make me angry. I’m good at hiding it though!My family is kind of crazy. So once we get to the point where you want to meet my parents and siblings, you’re going to be in for an experience. Don’t get me wrong, I love my family and our customs, but it’s just different from what most people are used to. It’s not crazy in a bad way, it’s just crazy in that it differs from the American norm. My family pretty much follows Palestinian culture at home. Ar

This answer is to the guys who have texted me that I write answers so that people would approach me. I have a huge ego problem. Do not expect me to text you back after you've started the fight and stopped texting me. I text from my side a lot but never to manure the ego of someone else who is wrong.I am 100/100 a Moody Person. My mood can get ruined just by a word. I won't show it by speaking about it but my face won't be able to hide it. I need space a lot of space. Space is the only thing that I need for 360 days out of the 365.I can become clingy. The rest 5 days I need someone, anyone to be

I dont like public display of affection. I think it's cute to see people deeply in love but I was standing in line one time a woman had her hand tucked in her lover's pants and it just grosses me out. I also fidget and therefore holding hands for a while is actually painful. There are times I think it's cute like I was at a resturant and the host went outside and his girlfriend ran to him and tightly hugged him. That is cute. Dry humping while making out is not cute.I dont like kissing. I know but saliva is gross. Quick kisses are great but no tongues. Never tongues. I dont think i ever tried 

I'm married, but it seems like everybody and their brother is answering this question, so I guess it's time to hop on the old bandwagon. I'm sure my wife will corroborate all five of the following reasons why people shouldn't date me: I'm a morning person. Even worse: I'm downright perky in the morning. I usually get up between 6 and 7 AM, sometimes earlier, and I spring out of bed and do things like hum or sing or sashay around the house. I like to get up and get started on the day and have the afternoon and evening to relax. I start getting sleepy around 9:30 PM, so you night owls are out of 

Because I will let you down and disappoint you. It’s inevitable. It will probably start out being great. I am fun to be with at first and if I like you I will usually only see the best about you. I’ll think you’re the most wonderful person in the world. During the initial phase of our relationship I will also disappear wherever I’m feeling depressed, irritable or particularly moody. This part can last for quite a while. You might decide this is too frustrating for you and things won’t progress any further. This is for the best because at this point I don’t care enough about you that I’ll be reall 

I won't elope with you and leave my parents. My parents raised me since birth and I only knew you for two months so there is no chance I will ditch them. I'm romantic but I'm not stupid and life isn't a Bollywood movie.If you hate to remind people about tasks needed to be done stay ten miles away from me. I procrastinate and forget a lot. So if you don't want to remind me to take my medication for the rest of your life then don't bother being my girlfriend.I'll let you work if you want but always remember I'm the main breadwinner who feeds the family. I'll help you around the house out of love

I don’t get easily attached. I have a hard time truly falling in love with someone. The truth is that I’ve been hurt a lot. I’ve been mentally, physically, and emotionally abused so much throughout my entire life that I’m almost incapable of truly loving someone and putting my entire heart, soul, and mind into it. I also struggle with giving affection and attention, which you need to continually to remind me to give to you or at least teach me how to. Yes, I am currently dating someone, but thankfully they understand this part of me.I’m super patriotic, which is totally a good thing if you liv

I am weird and abrasive. No, I don’t mean this in a fun quirky way. I mean this in a Norman Bates way. On our first date, I will intentionally do or say something mildly strange, annoying, or inappropriate just to see how you take it. If you can roll with it, or even better, do something equally odd and awkward, I will like you more. You want someone fun and quirky? Go to a punk show or something. You want a guy who rocks back and forth and makes weird bird noises while listening to you talk? Come see me.Your friends will not like me, and neither will your parents. You will have to “explain” m

What is a hobby that you might not want to mention on a first date?
During a first date, what has a date said that made you realize that it is not going to work out?
Are friends with benefits a good idea?
It depends. Most people want the warmth of another body, to get sexual pleasure and (if they are smart) give it in return. Unfortunately it’s not as easy as hitting the drive through or grabbing a few scratch-offs, unless of course you want to pay for it. Sex is an intimate act, to some the ultimate form of bonding which means you can’t just walk up to anyone, say you need a quickie and they are going to say, “Sure!” Okay I pulled it off a few times back in the day. However that means more than just a pump and run, there usually needs to be some kind of relationship as a basis, but sometimes a  

“Friends with Benefits” is a sort of vaguely-defined relationship category in society, just like “Relationship” or “Friendship” or any number of other human relationship types. I don’t find these categories a particularly useful framework for thinking about relationships, and I find that thinking in these ways is prone to misunderstandings and sometimes tension or emotional hardship in the long-run, like if people have mismatched intentions, boundaries, or expectations from these sorts of connections. On the other hand, I don’t think there is anything inherently bad or unhealthy about non-exclus 

“What does it mean to be friends with benefits?” Mutual gratification. Friends with benefits is where friends transcend another level in their friendship to give each other sexual gratification without the usual expectations of a romantic relationship. I had a friend with benefits when I met my wife. My friend was a single mom and artist, who came to me as a shiatsu volunteer. We became friends and she complained how men and relationships sucked away the energy she needed for her art and her daughter. However, people still have needs. Since I wasn’t seeing anyone at that time, we made a deal that  

I am a guy who had been in a FWB relationship for around 2.5 years. So, it started like this I was a teen age guy back then, the girl was a friend of mine . I never had any sexual feelings for her initially, but later ended up being in a fwb relationship with her . We used to meet each other everyday, we both didn’t have any thought about kissing each other . We used to hang out in the evenings , went out to eat, went on long drives together and we were really emotionally close . We used to laugh, play , and the strange part , She was in a relationship with another guy at that time while she was  

It can be really fun and a great way to meet your needs without getting into the throes of a relationship, but it can have it’s pitfalls. Below is my protocol: If the sex is good, then keep it going until one of you develops feelings.One of you likely will develop feelings. It takes 2 really emotionally unavailable people to sidestep feelings.If you’re the one to develop feelings, there are 3 options:Option 1 - Tell them and hope they feel the same way. If they don’t, then check Options 2 and 3.Option 2 - Get out and get out fast before you get really hurt. Unless, the sex is really, really goo

It can be, depending on the maturity of the people involved and the surrounding circumstances. In my experience, females tend towards emotional attachment towards the person they are intimate with; it’s a chemical/hormonal thing (Oxytocin: The Love and Trust Hormone Can Be Deceptive). This may have contributed to most of my casual sex relationships progressing into more socially acceptable relationships. Although, it’s also worth stating that these were good and long term relationships.. until they weren’t. I know it’s a little hypocritical of me to say that someone who engages in casual sex is 

Hi! So I'm in high school. I was in love with one of my best friends for a really long time and he really liked me back too but he didn't want to date. Nothing came of it, no kissing hand holding or anything and in the long run he ended up breaking my heart. It's been about 4 months since I completely got over him and even though I see him and we hang out together a lot I have been feeling fine. I don't think about him the way I used to or anything but I sometimes still get that urge to kiss him or make out with him. I'm a very innocent girl, I have never gone farther than a peck with a boy, b 

Not even remotely. The idea of FWB probably comes from watching too much porn. It looks fun having sex, so guys think if I can find a girl to have sex with it will be fun for both of us. But sex is not “fun”. It is emotionally bonding. Porn is a lie. It is usually sexually abused young women who were victims of rape or incest who have lost their self worth. When you try to drag that fantasy concept of FWB into the real world, it is nothing more than a man sexually abusing a woman. Men enjoy sex from the get go, because their bodies are designed that way. Women’s bodies are designed to find sex pa 

Well there is nothing wrong in that unless both the sides agree mutually. Let's be honest here I won't try to be a diplomat I don't believe in this idea at all if you are friend and to an extent that you ready to be intimate with each other in the most personal way then surely one of the two falls for the other and then the whole idea becomes one messed up situation.  If by any means you found such girl then you are in a mutual business with each other, there will be no friends part as both of you are too busy in your own life and sex is just a tool for pleasure, the thought itself for me is dis 

For the past 31.5 years I have had a friend with great benefits. (Smiling about what happened this morning.) So many have the illusion that marriage is some sort of endless romantic passion or perpetual infatuation. It is NOT. It is living with your best friend. Sure, there are hugs and kisses, but not always every time you may want. You have to put up with the personality quirks and emotions of another person. You have to learn to forgive and to ask forgiveness. But there are indeed benefits. For one, married people report a much higher level of relationship and sexual satisfaction than others

Here are some of my tips on what not to do on a first date: Texting While on The Date Before I started consistently hearing from women about this I honestly believed it was some stereotype that existed only in movies. But no, which is why I have to say this. STAY OFF OF YOUR PHONES WHILE ON DATES Unless you're showing her something (which I recommend showing her cool pictures, cute animal pics or whatever else) keep your phone in your pocket, preferably on silent/vibrate. And if you do show her something from that one cool trip you had, then bring up the topic, talk about it for a moment and show  

Never show up early for a first date. I had a date once, guy showed up 20 minutes early. I had just gotten out of the shower; I didn't even have clothes on yet. Not cool. I had to go out with my hair wet, and the date only went downhill from there.Don't talk about your ex? Everybody says this, and it's true enough. But if you're my age, where most people have kids and exes, it’s unnatural not to mention your ex. Stuff like, “Three kids, ages 7-15, youngest two live with their mom in Ontario, we've been divorced 3 years,” that's fine. It's actually weird if a man won't mention his kids on a fir

1. Don't overdress - Be stylish and sexy, just not overdress yourself. You want to earn the dude's respect and make him think you are a person worthy of pursuit - not just anything. 2. Don't in any way indicate that you are interested in future contact, until the very end - This is actually a tougher rule to follow than it would seem to be. Because sometimes you'll find yourself discussing a new restaurant that's supposed to be really cool, and you'll say something like, "We should go sometime." Or you'll mention one of your favorite books and, because you're a generous person, you'll say, "I c 

There are many big “No-No’s” in a first date. Usually a no-no would be a matter of opinion. The other party might see something that’s usually considered a big no-no as 100% okay, however there are those who see something that is acceptable in the first date as a big no-no for them. Keep that in mind. But there are general things that are seen as no-no’s, some are personal opinion. Personal questions - This can be a tricky one. Some girls (or boys) consider themselves an open book to some personal questions, but usually personal questions are asked best once you get to know the person. Unless i

Asking about in-depth details of ones sexual liaisons or sharing too much about yours is not good. Even discussing past romantic relationships should be kept on quiet mode. Talking negatively about specific members of the sex you are sexually attracted to is a big big no-no, especially men of women. Do not give a woman any reason to feel insecure or like she is being compared to anyone else. The reverse is true too. Don’t talk openly about celebrities you find attractive, or the types of women/men, and err on the side of caution if they ask you about it. Discussing things that make someone worry 

After chatting for such a long time, you finally made an appointment with the girl. You're excited and you wish that you could make a good impression on her through this date and then your relationship can go a long way. You've got everything planned, what clothes to wear, where to eat, and even humorous anecdotes to say at dinner. You thought that it must be a very romantic and perfect first date. But if you're constantly criticizing your ex in your spare time waiting for meals, your new relationship is almost dead. Many times we spend a lot of time thinking about what we should do on a first d 

1. Avoid controversial topics. Politics, religious beliefs, gender issues, etc., are more likely to trigger disputes between the two. Relationship experts suggest that it is better not to use these topics as topics on the first date, so as to avoid provoking unprovoked war on the spot. As a result, the purpose of getting to know each other more through conversation can not be achieved. 2. Don't ask why you are still single. On the face of it, it seems nothing, but it is unlikely to be accepted in a positive way. "There's nothing wrong with being single, not everyone's goal in life is to be in lov 

Play it safe. A lot of people try to not offend on date 1. But time is money. A lot of people are time wasters. Why is Instagram so popular? It gives people instant gratification:  For men especially, they need to be aware that shoes, attention, security and the Disney fantasy of relationships are keys for many women. Not all, but quite a few. Especially younger women. Getting attention is a huge thing. So if you are just desperate to get to date 1, it isn't great. Like in business, it never appears good when somebody tries too hard to persuade me `just to meet` as it reeks of desperation. So I wou 

I have a friend who is what some might call a womanizer. He has gone on dozens and dozens of first dates, and has been in more than a handful of relatively serious relationships. This friend has a routine that he uses on first dates. He has a set of actions and lines that he uses on almost every first date he goes on to try and give himself the best chance of getting the girl he’s with. And, of course, by “get,” I mean sex. That’s all he really wants: to use girls for their bodies and then brag to his friends about it. Well, I guess I should say that that is almost always what he wants to do. Becaus 

First dates should really just be about seeing whether you two click. They should be fun, involve some (not too heavy) discussion, and ideally limited to a relatively short time period. Now, that being said, if you have a big deal-breaker or two that you’d like to put on the table right away, you can do so. But you have to be reasonable about how you approach someone. For example, if you’re looking to get married eventually and you view dating as primarily a way to test compatibility and see over time whether this is someone you’d like to marry, you can say something like “I only date guys who  

What are some deal-breakers or major turnoffs that men see in women's online dating profiles?
Is online dating worth it?
I’m going to go against the grain here and say that in my personal circumstances, online dating is not only worth it, but quite literally the best way for me to date. Let’s go through the reasons why: I live in London. London is a massive cosmopolitan city, and you’re sure to find all kinds of interesting people. On OKC I had the pleasure of conversing with an eclectic variety of people, from DJs and sound engineers to IT and data professionals to cooks and concept artists. I met Spaniards and Latvians and Indians and Singaporeans and Jamaicans. I was able to widen my social circle because of it

Online dating increases the pool size of potential dates because it puts you out there in front of hundreds to thousands of people in a short amount of time. The reason it is more efficient is because you can cycle through the likes or dislikes with a click of your mouse, opposed to taking the time to seek out and talk to people on a one to one basis. It is a very sanitary way to go about dating because it minimizes the risks for rejection. A profile is like a person’s personal website for dating. It’s a sales tool. Everyone says all the right things and puts their best pictures up. (Unless th 

Honestly, the more time I spend on it, the less worthwhile I think it is. These are the biggest problems as I see them: Everybody’s the same There’s very little to go on to distinguish one person from another. People talk about the same very limited group of things, they all express similar hobbies with slight variations, they all want to be unique but are much less so than they think, they all try for the same types of pictures (or just don’t put in any effort). After almost 300 matches on Tinder, I start to get very bored very quickly with new ones. Oh cool, you like travel. Wow, you like music 

Well it depends. I used to go onto Tinder. I heard about this app through one of my sisters friends. She told about how she was going on multiple dates a day! And she herself said that if it wasn't for this app her life would be so boring. She said that she had "scored" dates with guys that would on a usual day not even look at her once. So I myself gave it a try. It started out slow at first but soon enough the dates piled up sometimes 2 to 3 dates a day or 4 a week. Don't get the wrong idea I myself am not exactly the most beautiful attractive woman! But hey I had great pictures of myself and  

If you lost your job, would you ask “is online job searching worth it?” Hell no. I want to find a job organically, not put myself out there like a prostitute. I much prefer meeting employers through my network and just clicking in person. If you’re jobless, you should just stop looking for work. If the job is right for you, it will fall into your lap when you least expect it. I’ve been on Indeed and Monster for a month now, I filled out almost half my profile, and I haven’t even been contacted by a single recruiter! Searching for jobs online is a complete waste of time. In my day, you would get up 

Personally, I don’t think it’s worth it. I got to know Tinder through a friend who used that just to hookup with girls— in other words, have casual sex. Afterwards, I never intended to take Tinder seriously, ever. I’m completely disinterested in online dating because too many people are there for No Strings Attached casual sex and I’m not the type of people who’s into this. I have ever made friends from the internet though and I have been groomed by the guys before. They always ask to be boyfriend but keeps wanting to proceed to sex before it’s too soon. To make it worse, those guys are the sa 

Is online dating worth it? Uhhhh… Why don’t you ask my online boyfriend who is a Nigerian PRINCE. We met online around 6 months ago. He emailed me and told me a large sum of money was trapped in the national bank of Nigeria following the overthrow of a government. #fairytale It was strange at first because I didn’t remember signing up to any African dating sites. But it’s been so worth it. I know he’s serious about our relationship too because he hasn’t pressured me for sex once. Not one single time. #respect All he asks for is my bank details and personal information to transfer the money out of t 

It was worth it for me. I met my wife in late 1999 on a simple dating website which was later rolled into Match . com. We’ve been married since early 2002 and have 3 kids. What was NOT worth it for me, though, was answering women’s ads. I spent a lot of time on that and went on a lot of dates, but the only three women that I met through dating websites and dated more than once had ALL contacted me first. The one who became my wife never placed an ad of her own at all, and other one had placed only a very short ad with no picture. They didn’t ask me out; they just commented on my ad, gave me info 

Online dating is a great avenue to look into if you want to augment your romantic life. Used correctly, you can fare much better online than you might at a bar or a club, through sheer numbers and exposure, if nothing else. It can make it easier to get things started, especially if approach anxiety is part of your issue.  But remember: it's not a silver bullet that will magically solve your dating problems. Just like when meeting people face-to-face, expect to strike out online, more than you'll succeed. But it'll sting less and waste less of your time. You'll be able to go over hundreds of pro 

The disadvantages of online dating apps -Bad intentions Not everyone has the best intentions online. Some online dating apps are used for fun, without a genuine desire for a relationship. Maybe they are looking to start a relationship with a stranger, or they are trying to get back at the unfaithful spouse. Most people like to window-shop when they are excited or blue. -It's easy to get hurt Due to the anonymity of apps, not everyone has the greatest aspirations of a long-term relationship. With stalkers, gold-digging, and threats running rampant online, who is not afraid of being hurt? No one wan

The reason it is more efficient is because you can cycle through the likes or dislikes with a click of your mouse, opposed to taking the time to seek out and talk to people on a one to one basis. It is a very sanitary way to go about dating because it minimizes the risks for rejection. A profile is like a person’s personal website for dating. It’s a sales tool. Everyone says all the right things and puts their best pictures up. (Unless th 

Honestly, the more time I spend on it, the less worthwhile I think it is. These are the biggest problems as I see them: Everybody’s the same There’s very little to go on to distinguish one person from another. People talk about the same very limited group of things, they all express similar hobbies with slight variations, they all want to be unique but are much less so than they think, they all try for the same types of pictures (or just don’t put in any effort). After almost 300 matches on Tinder, I start to get very bored very quickly with new ones. Oh cool, you like travel. Wow, you like music 

Well it depends. I used to go onto Tinder. I heard about this app through one of my sisters friends. She told about how she was going on multiple dates a day! And she herself said that if it wasn't for this app her life would be so boring. She said that she had "scored" dates with guys that would on a usual day not even look at her once. So I myself gave it a try. It started out slow at first but soon enough the dates piled up sometimes 2 to 3 dates a day or 4 a week. Don't get the wrong idea I myself am not exactly the most beautiful attractive woman! But hey I had great pictures of myself and  

If you lost your job, would you ask “is online job searching worth it?” Hell no. I want to find a job organically, not put myself out there like a prostitute. I much prefer meeting employers through my network and just clicking in person. If you’re jobless, you should just stop looking for work. If the job is right for you, it will fall into your lap when you least expect it. I’ve been on Indeed and Monster for a month now, I filled out almost half my profile, and I haven’t even been contacted by a single recruiter! Searching for jobs online is a complete waste of time. In my day, you would get up 

Personally, I don’t think it’s worth it. I got to know Tinder through a friend who used that just to hookup with girls— in other words, have casual sex. Afterwards, I never intended to take Tinder seriously, ever. I’m completely disinterested in online dating because too many people are there for No Strings Attached casual sex and I’m not the type of people who’s into this. I have ever made friends from the internet though and I have been groomed by the guys before. They always ask to be boyfriend but keeps wanting to proceed to sex before it’s too soon. To make it worse, those guys are the sa 

Is online dating worth it? Uhhhh… Why don’t you ask my online boyfriend who is a Nigerian PRINCE. We met online around 6 months ago. He emailed me and told me a large sum of money was trapped in the national bank of Nigeria following the overthrow of a government. #fairytale It was strange at first because I didn’t remember signing up to any African dating sites. But it’s been so worth it. I know he’s serious about our relationship too because he hasn’t pressured me for sex once. Not one single time. #respect All he asks for is my bank details and personal information to transfer the money out of t 

It was worth it for me. I met my wife in late 1999 on a simple dating website which was later rolled into Match . com. We’ve been married since early 2002 and have 3 kids. What was NOT worth it for me, though, was answering women’s ads. I spent a lot of time on that and went on a lot of dates, but the only three women that I met through dating websites and dated more than once had ALL contacted me first. The one who became my wife never placed an ad of her own at all, and other one had placed only a very short ad with no picture. They didn’t ask me out; they just commented on my ad, gave me info 

Online dating is a great avenue to look into if you want to augment your romantic life. Used correctly, you can fare much better online than you might at a bar or a club, through sheer numbers and exposure, if nothing else. It can make it easier to get things started, especially if approach anxiety is part of your issue.  But remember: it's not a silver bullet that will magically solve your dating problems. Just like when meeting people face-to-face, expect to strike out online, more than you'll succeed. But it'll sting less and waste less of your time. You'll be able to go over hundreds of pro 

The disadvantages of online dating apps -Bad intentions Not everyone has the best intentions online. Some online dating apps are used for fun, without a genuine desire for a relationship. Maybe they are looking to start a relationship with a stranger, or they are trying to get back at the unfaithful spouse. Most people like to window-shop when they are excited or blue. -It's easy to get hurt Due to the anonymity of apps, not everyone has the greatest aspirations of a long-term relationship. With stalkers, gold-digging, and threats running rampant online, who is not afraid of being hurt? No one wan 

What are some deal-breakers or major turnoffs that men see in women's online dating profiles?
A few, I will try and list them in order from most egregious to mild annoyance along with the rationale. Nothing: There seems to be a massive amount of people who don’t have anything in their profiles. Rationale: Probably just looking for an ego boost, and probably wont respond at all.People who only write: “How do people know how to write these things?”… (similar to above but different): A:We think and then we write, pretty simple eh?

Only because they list they are fine dating an atheist. My kids come first and are my entire life. We know, I have kids, they obviously come first. You only have to put you have kids for someone to know this.

I did online dating a few years ago, now I am engage, so online does work but it does take effort. However, one of the biggest deal-breakers for me was If I saw the following in one form or another on a person’s profile; I tell it like it is, or I am brutally honest, and most often it was followed with a..wanting no drama.The first shows a lack good communication. When people are “Telling like it is” or “are being brutally honest” it is a form of an insult that is a guise in honesty. They believe otherwise it would be sugar coating it. This mentality is very destructive in communication. The be 

In my brief attempt at online dating, I used Okcupid on my laptop. So keep that in mind. My major turnoffs in online dating profiles include: Nothing on your profile: This includes no pictures, nothing in the “about me” section, a one-sentence description, or a bunch of emojis. It just communicates to me that you’re not serious. It also tells me that I can expect one-word, or one-sentence responses to my messages (another deal-breaker for me)Ambiguous pictures: By this I mean you have a picture of something other than you, a quote, meme, or a fuzzy picture, or one not showing your face.

I recently started online dating…and I’m a woman seeking other women so I’m not quite the target audience for the question but being so new to the world there are tons of things I notice about women’s profiles that really turn me off. And my insights might be useful since a lot of these things would probably bother men too. Negative profiles listing everything you don’t want, don’t like and what people shouldn’t be…so obnoxious.

I tried a couple of online dating apps, including tinder, a while ago and a few things are an immediate turn off: Boring “likes” There are so many profiles I see on tinder where women list “food” as a thing they like. No really, you like food? Gosh, so do I! So much in common. If you live in Oxford, you tend to see “gin” listed as an interest over and over as well. Great, you drink alcohol. Very exciting.

Look, I get it, you love your pets. But saying, “ If you don't like dogs don't swipe left” or “I love my dog more than you” or “ Message me only if you have a cute dog”, is only going to repel men.

Why is there an abnormal amount of narcissists on online dating sites?
Is online dating worth it?
I’m going to go against the grain here and say that in my personal circumstances, online dating is not only worth it, but quite literally the best way for me to date. Let’s go through the reasons why: I live in London. London is a massive cosmopolitan city, and you’re sure to find all kinds of interesting people. On OKC I had the pleasure of conversing with an eclectic variety of people, from DJs and sound engineers to IT and data professionals to cooks and concept artists. I met Spaniards and Latvians and Indians and Singaporeans and Jamaicans. I was able to widen my social circle because of it

What is the best dating site?
Are dating sites any good? While most people don’t necessarily expect to find themselves re-entering the dating scene later in life, in today’s world it isn’t an uncommon situation. In fact, recent research indicates that singles in the United States now outnumber married couples. Whether you’re just coming out of a divorce or a long-term relationship, or it’s just been a while since you’ve put yourself out there, it might feel a bit overwhelming to think about dipping your pinky toe back into the dating pool. Here are seven tips to help you successfully traverse mid-life dating. Choose the Onli 

What is the best advice for using dating sites? As long as we’re talking about online dating sites, I can help you out. Beat the odds and make online dating work for you. Please excuse the length. I’m a touch typist, and got carried away, so off we went… Here are, off the top of my head, my top ten tips (more like 20) for success on online dating sites for both sexes. Think S&amp;M. We’re not talking about the usual S&amp;M, but Safety (or Security) and Marketing. Think first about your protection and then how to attract and retain the interest of the most desirable members of the opposite sex. Got it? F

The way people try to get to know new people has changed a lot in the last decade, going from bars, pubs, and clubs to dating apps, which have been trying to satisfy these changing needs. Nowadays we find countless apps, like Tinder, Badoo, Bumble, OkCupid, Happn, and many, many more. But Tinder is definitely the most popular, thereby effective, dating app: personally, I have always been using it and I had plenty of dates I am happy and satisfied about but I definitely am not the only one to think like that.  Of course, many different and usually personal factors should be taken into consideration 

It is like the first thing first, and we always believe that first launched thing is better than other things. This is not so true, but in 90% of the cases, it is true because no one can copy anyone correctly and there are lots of rules and regulation by which you cannot copy any idea and their marketing strategy quickly. So before explaining the trend and popularity of any of the dating app, I deliver you my favourite dating site. This is not other than Tinder, which I am using again and again. I do not believe in a permanent relationship and sincere relationship. I always use to make up with  

Hinge I’ll put in a vote for this somewhat less-than-popular dating app, as I think it stands out philosophically above the rest. My primary objection concerning most dating apps is that, since they make money when you use the app, and they stop making money when you find love, those that are most successful are those which are most addictive and present all the illusions of success without ever actually providing it. You spend your days swiping through attractive options, feeling validation like a kid in a candy store but never actually settling into a successful long-term relationship. This is 

It really depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for a good, all purpose dating site, Match.com is your best bet. If you are looking for a high quality site, but aren’t willing to pay for a membership, OkCupid is the way to go. There are also a lot of great niche’ sites out there if you have specific needs. Here are some to consider: Ourtime is great for people over 50 who don’t think of themselves as old enough to be on a site with “senior” in the name.Positivesingles is a great solution for people living with an STI.Mousemingle is an excellent option for Disney fans who want

You sign up with your Facebook account to ensure some level of identity verification (though your membership is not announced to your Facebook friends via your page, feed, etc.). The app then matches you to other Tinder users in the area around you – whether you’re at home, at work, in a bar, or on a trip. The app is free to download, and only takes a few seconds to 

 ABOVE: One of the very first selfies.  At first I thought this was a silly question, but as someone who’s written two books on status, created a card game, and built and coded a dating site from scratch it actually is a pretty smart question. Here’s why - because the dating sites are using you. So here’s how you use them. Understand that all ther algrythms in the wold and all the matching this that and the other thing do nothing other than to get a picture in front of you. it is up to you what you do next, and it all boils down to: The person you present to othersThe way you express yourself when yo

I had tried four of them, each once, but I'll only mention three of them since one was a private site that had more to it than just dating. I'm not getting into prices here because they vary too much depending on what features you purchase.  I can't tell you what I'd recommend, because I'm not sure what you're looking for, or what you would prefer. What I can give you is a crude, but reasonably accurate description of the general nature of each of the following sites. These are only my own experiences, so take them as nothing more than that. As a result I've determined that meeting people offlin 

Is online dating worth it?
I’m going to go against the grain here and say that in my personal circumstances, online dating is not only worth it, but quite literally the best way for me to date. Let’s go through the reasons why: I live in London. London is a massive cosmopolitan city, and you’re sure to find all kinds of interesting people. On OKC I had the pleasure of conversing with an eclectic variety of people, from DJs and sound engineers to IT and data professionals to cooks and concept artists. I met Spaniards and Latvians and Indians and Singaporeans and Jamaicans. I was able to widen my social circle because of it

Online dating increases the pool size of potential dates because it puts you out there in front of hundreds to thousands of people in a short amount of time. The reason it is more efficient is because you can cycle through the likes or dislikes with a click of your mouse, opposed to taking the time to seek out and talk to people on a one to one basis. It is a very sanitary way to go about dating because it minimizes the risks for rejection. A profile is like a person’s personal website for dating. It’s a sales tool. Everyone says all the right things and puts their best pictures up. (Unless th 

Honestly, the more time I spend on it, the less worthwhile I think it is. These are the biggest problems as I see them: Everybody’s the same There’s very little to go on to distinguish one person from another. People talk about the same very limited group of things, they all express similar hobbies with slight variations, they all want to be unique but are much less so than they think, they all try for the same types of pictures (or just don’t put in any effort). After almost 300 matches on Tinder, I start to get very bored very quickly with new ones. Oh cool, you like travel. Wow, you like music 

Well it depends. I used to go onto Tinder. I heard about this app through one of my sisters friends. She told about how she was going on multiple dates a day! And she herself said that if it wasn't for this app her life would be so boring. She said that she had "scored" dates with guys that would on a usual day not even look at her once. So I myself gave it a try. It started out slow at first but soon enough the dates piled up sometimes 2 to 3 dates a day or 4 a week. Don't get the wrong idea I myself am not exactly the most beautiful attractive woman! But hey I had great pictures of myself and  

If you lost your job, would you ask “is online job searching worth it?” Hell no. I want to find a job organically, not put myself out there like a prostitute. I much prefer meeting employers through my network and just clicking in person. If you’re jobless, you should just stop looking for work. If the job is right for you, it will fall into your lap when you least expect it. I’ve been on Indeed and Monster for a month now, I filled out almost half my profile, and I haven’t even been contacted by a single recruiter! Searching for jobs online is a complete waste of time. In my day, you would get up 

Personally, I don’t think it’s worth it. I got to know Tinder through a friend who used that just to hookup with girls— in other words, have casual sex. Afterwards, I never intended to take Tinder seriously, ever. I’m completely disinterested in online dating because too many people are there for No Strings Attached casual sex and I’m not the type of people who’s into this. I have ever made friends from the internet though and I have been groomed by the guys before. They always ask to be boyfriend but keeps wanting to proceed to sex before it’s too soon. To make it worse, those guys are the sa 

Is online dating worth it? Uhhhh… Why don’t you ask my online boyfriend who is a Nigerian PRINCE. We met online around 6 months ago. He emailed me and told me a large sum of money was trapped in the national bank of Nigeria following the overthrow of a government. #fairytale It was strange at first because I didn’t remember signing up to any African dating sites. But it’s been so worth it. I know he’s serious about our relationship too because he hasn’t pressured me for sex once. Not one single time. #respect All he asks for is my bank details and personal information to transfer the money out of t 

It was worth it for me. I met my wife in late 1999 on a simple dating website which was later rolled into Match . com. We’ve been married since early 2002 and have 3 kids. What was NOT worth it for me, though, was answering women’s ads. I spent a lot of time on that and went on a lot of dates, but the only three women that I met through dating websites and dated more than once had ALL contacted me first. The one who became my wife never placed an ad of her own at all, and other one had placed only a very short ad with no picture. They didn’t ask me out; they just commented on my ad, gave me info 

Online dating is a great avenue to look into if you want to augment your romantic life. Used correctly, you can fare much better online than you might at a bar or a club, through sheer numbers and exposure, if nothing else. It can make it easier to get things started, especially if approach anxiety is part of your issue.  But remember: it's not a silver bullet that will magically solve your dating problems. Just like when meeting people face-to-face, expect to strike out online, more than you'll succeed. But it'll sting less and waste less of your time. You'll be able to go over hundreds of pro 

The disadvantages of online dating apps -Bad intentions Not everyone has the best intentions online. Some online dating apps are used for fun, without a genuine desire for a relationship. Maybe they are looking to start a relationship with a stranger, or they are trying to get back at the unfaithful spouse. Most people like to window-shop when they are excited or blue. -It's easy to get hurt Due to the anonymity of apps, not everyone has the greatest aspirations of a long-term relationship. With stalkers, gold-digging, and threats running rampant online, who is not afraid of being hurt? No one wan

I saw comments as follows: He pays the bill without hesitation or requesting to go Dutch / split the check in any way.

I am writing this from a straight female’s perspective. He asks you out on a date properly, like a gentleman. “Would you like to go for dinner with me this Saturday?” Not a flippant “Wanna hang?”No last minute dates. He asks you out way in advance.

Before I was married these would have been some of my green flags… The ex never comes up in conversation, or even better they are still friendly with some of their ex’s. Which is lightly touched on. I don’t want to hear how his ex slept with his best friend, left his life in ruins, and even took the family dog. There is a reason I never watched soap operas, or rarely watch many dramas.Leaves the drama at home. Which goes hand and hand with my first green flag. It’s nice when the conversation is fun and light. Rather then heavy, and leaves me feeling like I just went though an emotional crisis b

I prefer to know who I’m dating. Friends into more. That way I already know the basics about him - whether he wants kids or not, what he believes in (yes, that does include his political leanings, but more about what he thinks are the important things in life), his feelings about religion, and, most important, whether he likes cats. That means a first date will mostly be about mutual attraction. Is there one? I doubt there would be a first date without it, but it allows you to flirt on a whole new level. It’s not necessarily overt, it’s taking things beyond friendship. No kiss at the end of the 

First dates should always be fun, while it’s an opportunity to weed out who do not deserve a second chance, it’s the same opportunity to find your possible future spouse. With that said I’ve got some tell-tale signs that are bright green lights. This shouldn’t even here but THEY ARE ON TIME or better yet early. ( the respect is so low in 2018 I had to put this in ). However for generosity purposes if they’re running late they actually tell you.They aren’t on their phones.

What were your feelings when you first met/saw your spouse?
 BEIJING: I first met my wife, Zhou Yawei, for the first time on April 5, 2011. Around that time, I had already moved to the Chinese capital city and had entered the ‘culture shock’ stage when after a few months after moving to a foreign country you feel strong anger about your surroundings. I moved to Beijing in October 2010. I met a psychiatrist from Shanghai who was delivering seminars for newcomers to China and he explained that your first three months in the country you have a honeymoon period, since everything feels new but after around four months you notice the problems and everything in 

Before I met my husband, I had never done anything with a man. And I mean anything. Not even hugs, handshakes or just a pat on the shoulder. I had not touched a man since I was 12. And no man had seen my hair or any part of my body save for the face and hands since then, with the exception of doctors and accidental touches, of course. That was simply because I was ultrareligious. And my family for the most part is too. I wanted to keep myself pure for my future husband, and in my circle we take that to the extreme. When I went to see my husband, that was the first time I broke all the rules. It wa 

I had gone to a teenage hangout. It was approximately 2 blocks. Everyone would walk and drive up and down the street. Talk, laugh, blast music and hangout. I saw him way before he ever saw me. Standing there in the dark, lamppost shining light down on his rippling muscles. He was surrounded by a bunch of people. The way he moved intrigued me! Luscious long curly black hair, 6′2, muscles everywhere and 6pack abs. I had to meet him. I walked up the street in his direction and was on a mission. People were trying to get me to stop and talk with them. I didn't care, I had to meet this guy. I finally 

We had been in a relationship for almost a month before we met for the first time. I went to her city and was staying with one of my good friends. We planned out everything a day before. So she had to pick me up as I didn’t have any vehicle. She was on her way and we were on call. I was standing in front of some hospital I don’t remember now when she asked me what I was wearing and I said “Yellow.” Although we had seen each others pictures before but she literally passed by me and didn’t even look. That is when I told her that she has passed a bit ahead of me and has to take a U- turn. She came back, 

Yes, I was wondering what’s this all about? It was she that made an effort to contact and started the conversation, the entire time I was suspicious. I couldn't help it, nor could I ditch the feeling that something wasn't quite right, although I couldn't put my finger on it the air was different, it was like a terrible Hot humid August night with no wind, except it wasn't summer it was late February around 6:30 PM and already dark outside at the Hanoi airport. Standing there I was beginning to question my perspective I had just hours before when arriving at the Salt Lake City International airpor 

I was searching for him in the airport. I'd only ever seen him through a phone screen or in a picture, we'd never met before. The previous months had been filled with Facetimes, phone calls, and many messages since he reached out to me. But after 5 months of talking online, he took the plunge and bought a ticket to Thailand from Houston, TX. He was traveling 9,000 miles to meet me. I was incredibly nervous to meet him. In fact, the previous night was spent by my best friend calling and pep talking me into going through with it. I was about to spend 8 days with the man I'd been talking to for month 

I was fifteen or so driving through Crescent city California to meet my Mothers newest boyfriend. I noticed a young woman with a straight back sitting upon a horse riding through the local Jack in the Box drive thru. There was another young lady behind her but I only had eyes for my wife. I got out of the car at the stop light and my Mother was baffled and pulled over. I stood starring at her from across the street. I noticed everything. The details of her like the angle her chin was being held and the way her hair was straight in places and curly in others. I noticed how confident and competent 

Nothing at all because she doesn’t exist. My life is a pathetic farce and I honestly never should have been conceived. The fact is I am one of those irredeemable misfit losers who will never be cut out for real serious love with any woman. It would be different if I were willing to settle and just surrender to someone who kindles no sparks anywhere inside all out of sheer desperation to be with just someone. Well I am not going to do that. Therefore it is a given that I am condemned to “permasolitude.” It is an incontrovertible fact that any and all women for whom I could ever feel the faintest 

My first thought when seeing my now husband for the first time was “Wow, who owns that gorgeous bum?”. Let me explain that a “bum” is another name for your “butt” in Ireland! Let me put it into context for you! My best friend, since I was 13 years old, was working part time in a snooker club (in the coffee bar area). I had just broken up with my then boyfriend and was going in to see her and cry on her shoulder! Lol. I was only 18 years old and clearly this other fella had no taste!!! Haha. Anyway, the snooker club was huge, but there was a private snooker room just off the coffee bar and this i 

It sounds cliche, but I met my husband at a wedding I attended as a guest. What’s interesting though is that although I’ve been to 400+ weddings, those were all for work as a photographer, so the number of times I’ve attended weddings as an actual guest was extremely rare - I usually don’t attend as I’m occupied photographing other people’s special days! Anyways, I was a last minute +1 for my friend Julie and I didn’t even know the couple getting married! Julie and I sat at a table and beside me was a guy whom I thought was beautiful. At the time he had a shaved head and piercings (he doesn’t a

What is a good first date location?
I will tell you about my dating strategy and how to progressively make the girl more and more comfortable. It works most of the times but yup sometimes it doesn’t. I am still learning. :) My first date is three step: I tell her to meet me at a public place. A coffee shop/ A mall etc. I will start with hugs, talking about normal stuffs. 15 min max Then comes the mid part. This is about building connection. We move to a more enjoyable location where I don’t have to talk all the time and there would be other activity to involve with. Since I don’t drink, we would usually go to a book store/ Bowling  

You worked up the courage to get her number and she even said yes to a date! There’s a feeling of excitement as the day gets closer, but as the day gets closer you’re still not sure where to go… Or maybe you haven’t gotten that far yet, maybe you just got her number and you’re trying to figure out where to ask her out. What would make a great date? Is it a rousing game of mini-golf? Bowling? Dinner and a movie? Or just straight asking her over to your place? None of the above! The reason that activity dates don’t work is because you want the women in your life to date you for you, not for the activi 

The whole point of a first day is to get to know one another. Its also a good idea to have fun together and create a memorable experience so that you and your date will continue onto other future dates together. Here are some helpful hints. Be comfortable, choose a place that is not too noisy so that you can actually hear each other speak. The last thing you want is to have to keep on asking the other person to repeat themselves. Amusement parks can be a good choice, because there are a variety of things to do. You can also move way from noisy areas and find quieter places to eat and talk.Avoid 

The best first dates will give the impression that they were completely improvised to come together like serendipity and yet ended up executed flawlessly. Generally speaking, these best first dates will move between a number of different locations rather than staying in one place. Staying in one place the whole time makes a date feel very static. Movement creates energy. Also, it’s better if you can walk between the places you’ll go on your date rather than drive. So the ideal general area to plan a date is in a downtown urban area, where there are a lot of things to do, and a lot of places you  

This is a very common problem, but also a very worthy of thinking. Because it's about whether a relationship can last forever. Most of the time, two people cut off contact after meeting each other, and some people have deeper feelings after the first date. So, how do they do it? According to my observation and the experience of my friends, I can recommend several places to you according to different personalities!  一、The first: shy personality People with this character are more suitable to go to some public places or places with many people. 1. Park. The park is a very good place, the environment  

We both reached restaurant on time. The waiter came to our table with a menu. I ordered sev puri and strawberry juice, whereas Rubina ordered just a glass of orange juice. I said, "North Indian recipes are delicious here. You should try it." "No, I had a heavy lunch." There was pin drop silence for some time. That usually happens during the first date. Rubina did not attempt to make friendly conversation. Maybe she was thinking that I was not a good match for her. Nevertheless, I refused to give up and tried my best to strike a bond of friendship with her. "What is your plan?" I asked. She gazed towards me  

Haha, dating might not be my cup of tea, but I’m pretty good while selecting dating venues :p GENERAL ADVICE(S): First dates are meant to understand your partner and spend some quality time, keeps things nice, and take it slow.If you're going for a drive, play some music from Beethoven or Mozart (I personally advice moonlight sonata ), it'll make a good impression and you don't have to worry about your partner’s preference as everyone loves Mozart and Beethoven.Avoid going to gardens and open air public places if you live in a small town ( ANTI ROMEO SQUAD will beat the S**t out of you if they’l

Hiking, ideally in the mountains.  The best thing about hiking is that it takes away all the tension. You stop worrying about your looks instantly as you put your foot in the mud. There’s really not much you can do about it, so you just accept that it’s part of the hiking and it’s okay. But if you still worry about dirty shoes, wait for 10 minutes until he/she also steps into the puddle. Trust me, at this point, you won’t be worrying about your shoes or looks. Plus, hiking brings people together. There’s a high chance you’ll come across some difficulty, like crossing the river or climbing something.   

Don’t be a hero, and keep it simple. If you’re over 21, I’d do a bar. If you’re under 21, maybe coffee or a bite to eat. Assuming that you met online, or out in a situation where you just met her, you don’t even know if you’ll have chemistry for an entire evening. This is your chance to see if you have chemistry. You don’t want to be stuck on a hike or an amusement park with a girl that you don’t ever want to see again. Or even worse, where you had a great time and found the love of your life and she drops the “no chemistry but you’re a great guy” bombshell on you when you text her the next da 

it depends on many factors such as age, taste,,,, etc but From my experience … the best date ever is in a BOWLING ALLEY. This place have all the component of a nice date experience. Advantages : 1- knowing you are going to a bowling game, you both would wear something comfortable like jeans, shorts, t-shirts etc,,, which will help both of you to be more comfortable. 2- you are on a date, so it doesn't matter if you won or lost “preferably make the girl win ;)” 3- there will be lots of laughs and positive energy during the game. 4- you don't need to sit at the table looking at each other trying to f 

What was the shortest first date you ever had?
47 minutes It all started with a Tinder message from a spooky guy let’s say. I live in Amsterdam, and there are always plenty of internationals traveling around here. So this guy he was 27 (I know I’m 20 but I really don’t mind the age since older bois seem to have a different personality than the average 20 y.o. guy), tall, dark hair, charismatic, fit and all that… And a bit too american let’s say. We met at a random bar and started having our first beer and we started chatting about whatever people talk when they first meet and I was already feeling a weird vibe from this man. Apparently, he ju 

I was doing the online dating thing and had many first dates but not many second dates. There are many people who stretch the truth in their profiles. Even the pictures they post can be lies. I read her profile and looked at the pictures she posted and decided to make contact. We messaged back and forth then progressed to talking on the phone. Things were going well. No red flags at this point. It was New Year’s Eve and I was at a friend’s steak house having a party in the bar. About 10 minutes before midnight I get a call from her. She told me she had no one to kiss at midnight and invited me o 

I was about 26. I think it was one of my first forays into internet dating. I was very honest. My photo was very recent (taken that week.) I’m lucky I look young for my age, though the fact I looked 18 or 20 might have a factor in the disaster date, I’m not sure to this day. At the time I was maybe 5 kilos overweight (I think that’s about 12 pounds?) but I was healthy other than that, and though nothing that special in the superficial looks department, I “scrubbed up well,” as an ex boyfriend charmingly put it. I met the guy near a busy Underground station, Embankment I think. It was during rus 

We didn't even get to the date bit. A mutual friend was a bartender and he was a regular, though not a heavy drinker. He really seemed to just need someone to talk to, she said he was a good guy, and I knew her well enough to trust her opinion. (EDIT: She and I were close, once upon a time, that's why I trusted her opinion. Then she married my ex boyfriend, despite me telling her what kind of person he was. She introduced me to this guy before marrying my ex, or I wouldn't have listened to her at all. She has no standards for men to meet, I have exceptionally high standards, hence why he becam 

Friends love this story, so I'll entertain everyone with the story of the man who said, “Ohhh, hell no..” It was an online connection. I really liked her long wavy hair and nice smile. Seemed a bit tomboy-ish, and I appreciate the “Peppermint Patti's" of the world, so that was nice. Agreed to meet up at a pub, not too far from me. I walk in, and I noticed her hair straight away.. But when she got up, she was kinda bikered out, complete with smoking a cigarette and sporting the drooping U-shaped chain hanging from her belt and into the front pocket of her jeans, or however that works. Clearly, s 

I had been to Tokyo for work and decided to stay 2 more weeks to visit the country. I went to Kyoto and Nara and also stayed a couple of days in a zen Monastery on the mountains. It was amazing, but at some point on my way back, it started feeling a little lonely, so I decided to download Tinder. I was in Kyoto and got matched mainly to expats who were around working or studying. It was Halloween and one American girl told me to meet her in a club in Osaka. I wasn’t sure about it, since she was cute but not a priori very bright from what we had exchanged and when I didn’t quickly say what I was 

I met him at an art opening. He was clipped, precise, manicured, and erect. Not my thing, but I was trying to be open minded. Ok, he was bald and furry. I was prepared to forgive a lot. We agreed to go out. I met him at the West Philly house he shared with three other people, a sprawling Victorian with golden strip-oak flooring. Beautiful. He gave me a tour of the place as if he owned it. He was obviously very proud. Unless you’ve built it, aggressive pride in a home confuses me. Ok, you’ve made a bunch of money and financed this thing, but did you lay the foundation, stud the frame, slather the 

It was barely 2 mins. I had been talking to this guy online for almost a month then finally decided to meet after having it rescheduled multiple times. We agreed to meet by 2pm Friday as it was his day off as well. It's for him just to swing by to my place so I'd be most comfortable, safety wise-of meeting a stranger for the first time. I was in my friend's place 30 mins before our scheduled time. Unknowingly he was already messaging which I wasn't able to read as I left my phone charging. 10 mins before 2pm, I checked &amp; saw his message of being upset of not knowing if I am still in or could be fl 

Less than two minutes, I swear! A friend of mine introduced me to his friend (let’s call her Sophie) and insisted we’d be great together. So I asked her out for lunch the next afternoon. Here’s how my conversation went with her the next day…  Me: “Hi Sophie. So nice to meet you.” She: “Oh hi yeah. I mean I hear that quite a lot, but thanks.” Me (mildly pissed off): “I see. So, let’s grab a quick lunch and…” She (interrupting me): “And then go shopping at the Toronto Eaton Centre ! ” Me: “Umm…not today please. I have an appointment at 4 pm which cannot be rescheduled. We can hang around till then.” She  

My shortest first date lasted no more than 30 minutes! Let’s go back when I was fresh out of high school, keep in mind that I never dated during grade school (just little crushes here and there). With three vigilant brothers and strict parents, I was very leery to date anyone. I remember working at a furniture store with huge windows, of course, to showcase their furniture. Sometimes my job was very boring since not very many people stopped by to check out the furniture. I would get away from my desk and stare outside as people walked by. There was one guy that took the time, probably from his jo
