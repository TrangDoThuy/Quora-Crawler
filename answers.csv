If you are the boss and one of your employees calls in the morning and says that they "didn't feel good" when they woke up that morning so they're taking a sick day, would you accept that excuse as given or would you probe for a more detailed answer?
Here’s how I handled those calls… plus the second half of this is a horror story of what happens when managers don’t believe employees when they call in sick. As a manager and later as a Department Head – including when I was Director of Human Resources for two different companies - if one of my employees called in sick, I accepted that statement “as is”. I would thank them for letting me know, ask them if there was anything I could do and ask if there was anything I needed to take care of or be aware of on their behalf while they were out. I then said something along the lines of “take care of y 
Writing from a smaller country so don’t want to break anonymity. I worked in a large office. We had plenty of people who took sickies. I have no doubt that they were sickies due to timing and rumours that come back but you can never be sure. A girl who had been a young but conscientious worker had started taking a lot of sick leave. This coincided with a new boyfriend. My fellow manager told me I needed to watch her as she was no longer reliable and was more interested in her boyfriend than work. I had not noticed any change but I was only part time so I took it at face value. One shift she came to 
I worked in the Leisure Sector in the UK and in every one of my jobs was in a Centre operated by the Local Authority. They are not now. In every single one of about 8 jobs, the policy was the same. I would normally ask with what, but they were not obliged to tell me. There was no such thing as Sickness Allowance, but I did know people in other employment who ‘had’ to use their Sickness Allowance for their vacation because they’d run out of Annual Leave. I found that unbelievable. All sickness was paid, dependant on their years of service (Thank God for the NHS). We did have abuse of the system 
While I don’t have employees, I do teach college classes and attendance is an issue. Here are my worst attendance stories: One morning while I was teaching, I looked at one of my students, a young woman from Viet Nam who had English as a Second Language. She looked really ill and I asked her if she was all right. She said she had the Chicken Pox. I asked her if she was contagious. She said the doctor didn’t say she was contagious. I went on teaching and looked back at her after several minutes. Somehow, she looked even worse. I asked again if she was really okay. She said, “The doctor didn’t say 
I used to work in a call center for a cable TV company. As is usual for call center, there was an environment that was based on wringing every last drop of work out of their staff. We weren't people, we were resources to be used and discarded. Here are three anecdotes from my time there. A nice older lady lost her voice on the phones. She wanted to go home and rest her voice but was pressured into staying by the managers. The next day she was a bit better but lost her voice again by the end of the day. And again. And again. She took a couple of days off and went to her doctor. They couldn't fin 
Unfortunately this is extremely common for my employees. I have learned to just accept it instead of trying to enforce a strict attendance policy and then I keep track of these incidents and once a pattern emerges I bring it to their attention and give them one chance to fix it. I never asked questions because employees who are faking it well mention something extremely personal or something that will make you sound like a monster for questioning. Keep very detailed records regardless because I was sued by a former employee who had the absolute worst attendance issues I've ever seen in my life 
I completely agree with Dianne Dawson’s answer, that it is not up to a boss or anyone else to judge whether the person is sick. I’m adding my own comments because sometimes you can’t even tell when looking at or talking to a person that they are truly feeling bad, especially if they don’t have obvious symptoms, like runny nose, watery eyes, etc. When I worked and sometimes had migraines, I hated to call in sick because I didn’t “sound” sick on the phone and was afraid I wouldn’t be believed. Here’s a sad story that shows a person doesn’t always “sound” sick. I had a friend in a writers group of 
I absolutely WOULD NOT question it or seek a more detailed answer. I ran a radio station- several actually at this point. Media people have silly huge egos, so it's actually quite an exercise in management. But my only response to hey Eric I'm taking a sick day has only ever been, awww damn bro sorry to hear you're not feeling well, feel better soon, get some chicken noodle soup dude. Tell (mention wife's name) I said hey. If you need anything, man, you know where to find me bro. That's it. Typical Eric Moore employee calling in sick response. Because really, let's think about it: From a busines 
For the first 15 years or so of my practice, my partnership had a very traditional type of leave policy. It was cumbersome and our in-house bookkeeper devoted a couple of days a month to payroll and leave administration for a small office of about eight employees, and another half-day straightening out mistakes, answering employee questions and fussing with the differences in tax treatment of different kinds of leave. When I went out on my own, I decided to do things differently. Before I hired a new staff person, I did a thorough local wage analysis, and set the pay for the position about 20%  
I used to give the day off - no questions asked. And to be honest, I never bothered if they reported it as a sick leave to HR. No point asking an employee to come in if they are not feeling up to it. I’d just ask them to login and check their mails if they could … and be available for a call or two, just in case (And I would always message them in advance if I wanted them to be on a call later on). I myself used to suffer a bit from what my boss called “Monday-itis” (He definitely was on to me), so I understood when that particular malady afflicted the 30 - 35 odd people who I was responsible fo 
This is something coming from an employee’s perspective. A little quick background: I am a divorcee who has chronic and severe PTSD, which includes severe depression and anxiety issues from my abusive marriage. I have 2 kids from that marriage, and now have a wonderful partner who has a kid from his first marriage. I am someone who prides herself on coming into work, even if I feel kind of crappy. If my kids are sick, and my partner is home, I let him deal with the kids. However, one of my last jobs I had was at a company where the stress levels kept ratcheting up, and our commissions (I’m in s 
I used to be one of the managers at a company that had a “no-fault” attendance policy. You were allowed up to 10 “occurrences”; ten would be termination. Calling off one day was one occurrence; being late or leaving early (after at least half your shift) was one quarter occurrence. Each occurrence or portion of one would roll off after one calendar year. There were other ways to reduce them, such as perfect attendance, but I’ll leave that out as it gets a little complicated. If you missed three days for a medical reason, then a doctor’s note would roll the three into just one occurrence. Very fr 
When people call in sick, they’re not providing an “excuse”, they’re providing a “reason”. You give an “excuse” when you know you’ve done wrong, you give a “reason” when there’s just cause. Also, most people are not malingerers. True, some are, but there are usually other signs of laziness, lack of enthusiasm, etc which will give the game away. If you don’t trust your employees to be honest, you’re not showing enough respect to them. So, you’ll get the same amount of respect in return. “Do as you would be done by”. And yes, you can feel sick in the morning and then feel right as rain by mid-after 
It is quite common for an employee to “not feel good” enough to come to work, but to feel good enough later that day to go shopping or go to a ball game. Probing, or later spying on, the employee may show that. But no one has the time for that sort of thing. And demanding that an employee show up for work — probably late — to prevent a shopping trip or a ball game, is just going to create a disgruntled and probably unproductive employee. If the person is genuinely on the edge of illness, it could lead to financial liability for the company. At the extreme, it could lead to an employee coming to 
I would accept the excuse because I am one of the employees that calls in sick. I’ve never lied. Sometimes I get really crippling period cramps. I’m talking knives stabbing the insides of my uterus and I feel nauseous and have pretty bad diarrhea. This happens a couple of times a year and any painkillers I take are useless for about 3–4 excruciating hours after which I just pass out and sleep for about 3 hours. I’m not comfortable sharing this (it’s also hard to talk because I’m scared I’ll get sick) especially if I have a male boss but I’d prefer not to have to say so to a female boss either.  
Just go with it if you are the boss. My story: As a teacher by then, about 10 years in the field, we had a fairly new principal come in. I rarely missed work and if I did, my lesson plans were always out and the students knew exactly what I expected from them. One Friday I went home and by Sunday was running a high temperature. My mother had called me and knew something wasn’t right. I wasn’t making sense in the phone. Next thing I know, mother is at my door. I couldn’t figure it out because we had just hung up. (At that time they lived two hours away). I had passed out I guess. Mom took my tem 
When I was my mid 20’s (2007/2008) I worked at a state job. I had type 2 diabetes and it really made me sick a lot (they were attempting to change my meds to get me to feel better.) I woke up one morning, sick as a dog. I had a fever, I was throwing up, and my blood sugar was wacky. My husband had left for work already and I was in no condition to drive. I called my boss (D) and she said “I don’t care. There’s a bathroom next to your desk, I need you in here. Find a way or I’m going to write you up..” and hung up the phone on me. One of my coworkers (S) overheard the conversation and called me. W 
Different companies have different policies, and sometimes managers managers in big companies will act differently as well. In my many years in the workplace, I’ve worked under a number of different systems, and now I own my own small business with employees. I’ve learned a few things over the years: First, every employee has different values, and second, you really can’t force anyone to do anything they don’t want to do. The time to discuss calling in sick comes long before they call in sick. In my small business, it is often just me, and one, maybe two employees working at any time. If someone  
I believe my employees as is now. But I have also learned to hire trustworthy employees now. It wasn't always the case. When I was a newbie at hiring, I hired people just because they seemed to be nice or said they were interested in the job and were qualified for the job. It didn't turn out well. One of those instances is when I had an interview with a perspective employee and she just texted 30 minutes before her interview that she would be late by 30 minutes because of traffic. My staff politely told her that I won't be available at that time and we would have to reschedule to a different tim 
This is an interesting question and, judging by the variety of answers here, one that has no perfect answer. Here’s my two cents. Generally speaking, an employee’s medical record is none of your business, with a few caveats. Obviously, if there are long-term issues or accommodations that need to be made, it is something that should be discussed in a sensitive manner. You’re managing a business after all and need to know if this employee is reliable. If you work in the food service industry, there are certain things you may be required to ask. For example, many food service businesses will not all 
What is more important to you? A positive, honest and mutually respectful relationship with your employees, or a relationship governed by lies, distrust, revenge and passive-aggressiveness? What you do as the boss will have a strong say in how that relationship will be. There are two possible situations, which you don’t know for sure. You can spot patterns of sick days around holidays and weekends, but you can’t know for sure. First, the employee is not telling the truth. Your immediate thought may be that they are a bad human being for not telling the truth. You might feel angry and betrayed. You  
I am not a manager but I do have a story of an old boss of mine. I worked at a small physical therapy clinic for some years. My supervising physical therapist and manager of the therapy side of the clinic is an amazingly understanding person. The owner of the clinic, who was our boss, viewed his employees strictly as work horses. To him, employees had no other outside obligations, responsibilities, or issues that may cause them to call out. Example: one of our front desk personnel had to call out one day because her niece that she was extremely close to was raped and was in the hospital. Our bo 
If an employee calls saying not feeling well, it’s NOBODYS business but the employees’. The employer is not the “boss” of their entire life. If an employee reports sick 3 times in a row or more, that should definitely warrant a doctors note, but the doctor is not obligated to give ANY details of the illness / mental or emotional state. To probe for a more detailed answer can get you in legal trouble for trying to violate HIPAA Privacy Rules. Side note: I moved to the US from Canada, and it sickens me that when my coworkers call out sick, they give details of their illness to our supervisor who  
Every time I read this kind of questions and the related answers, I realize how lucky we are in Europe, where workers have rights and are not considered only “money-making” machines. Almost everywhere in Europe (at least for sure in Italy, French and Germany), if you have a permanent contract, you are legally entitled to 20–30 days of paid vacation time, no question asked. For short-time contracts, you generally are entitled to 2–3 days/month. You just have to arrange with your boss so that your absence is not critical for the work, but no one can refuse a day oh holiday if you don’t have a va 
I would take that excuse as a given and here's why: Past December I got infected with covid. I had been infectious for a few days before the symptoms hit, and they hit all of a sudden. The day before I was feeling fresher than ever, chirpy and energetic; i was well rested and no one would've imagined I'd be very sick soon. I slept well and enough that night and had no reason to be sick, yet, the next morning, although there wasn't anything wrong with me yet, no sore throat, no cough, no trouble breathing, no fever, no flu, I remember when I woke up I “wasn't feeling good”. I have a pretty toxic e 
Definitely don't probe. As a district manager once had to tell my store manager (I am also a manager so this was at a mgr mtg), who not only probed but bullied, “we're not doctors. We don't decide if someone is or isn't sick. They call out you say ok and leave it at that” This particular store manager was 1) new to the role 2) coming from Alaska to California where the laws are different and 3) is a bully. Once, towards the beginning of her tenure at that location, I called in a personal day. Perspective, I NEVER called out. She told me that it was not ok and that she'd call me at 4 to see if I  
What exactly are you hoping to find out from this employee of yours? That he has horrid burning fluids spewing out of his mouth and hindquarters every five minutes? That it’s a migraine day and she’s been crying and curled up in the fetal position like a dying baby since 5am? That bright green toxic sludge is pouring out of his nose and being coughed up all over the house at a near constant rate? That she’s experiencing sharp stomach pains and that she needs to freely fart all day today? That today’s the day his doctor is going to get right up into his arse and finally remove those painful hemorrho 
I am a boss and I have been through exactly this sort of thing. The short answer is No, i would not probe further. I do not need to know any details about how they are feeling. I also don’t need to know if they are physically sick or if they are just taking a “Mental Health” day. Which is something I will do my self from time to time. I believe my company does have a policy that says if you are sick for more than 2 days in a row you must have a doctors note. But, I would not enforce that unless I was specifically directed to by Sr. Management. And, they won’t do that. I want to keep my employees 
If you are the boss and one of your employees calls in the morning and says that they "didn't feel good" when they woke up that morning so they're taking a sick day, would you accept that excuse as given or would you probe for a more detailed answer? I don’t understand why some bosses seem to think that they need to know anything about why people want to take a day off. Employers give benefits. One of those benefits is PTO - Paid Time Off, also known as vacation, sick days, personal days. Then many of them try to take control of that benefit to “make sure” it’s not being abused. You are giving a 
I didn’t accept it. We are a small hotel, on breakfast is only me and the waitress. We have set breakfast times for the guests from 7 - 9. The waitress serves the food, do the dishes, cleans the restaurant and the kitchen after breakfast. Normally she’s there until 11:30. I do the cooking and after 9 I check guests out and then I go to clean the rooms. We had this new waitress for the weekend, Saturday and Sunday only. When she started working there she already stated she might not be able to come next weekend, depends on her main job, blah blah and I should wait for her, she wanted to let me kn 
Keep in mind that I’m speaking about my long term work place, a city police department. If this was an isolated sick call in I absolutely would not probe further into the judgment of the employee or even ask what the problem was. We were advised years ago by our city legal team that doing so was at best questionable and possibly illegal. We do have specific and detailed requirements in place for someone who calls more than twice in a row. The employee must subsequently bring in a doctor’s statement that the employee is under their care and estimating the probable date of return to work. This s 
If you are the boss and one of your employees calls in the morning and says that they "didn't feel good" when they woke up that morning so they're taking a sick day, would you accept that excuse as given or would you probe for a more detailed answer? If an employee calls in “sick,” and the employee has accumulated sick time to cover the absence, it is none of your business as to the actual reason for the call off. We all have a bad day now and then. Most companies have call-off policies regarding sick leave, and they are spelled out upon hiring: number of consecutive days, extended leave, etc. H 
Here’s my take on it as an employee: When I call in sick, I am actually sick and contagious. Having worked in healthcare settings for nearly 30 years, I know that going in sick is bad for everyone (co-workers and any patients you are around). When I worked a job outside of healthcare for over 7 years (which was with family…big mistake), I was always made to feel like I was lying if I called in sick (even when I was unable to get out of my neighborhood during massive flooding in our area, I was made to feel like I was full of it…until they saw the photos and the news reports. I would have been  
It really depends on the employee. Do they call in frequently? If so, a verbal warning about calling in a lot is appropriate - people are given a certain number of “sick days” for a reason - the work place relies on its employees to perform the necessary work, and chronic absenteeism affects the productivity and efficiency of a business. Someone who persists in frequent calling in can then be given a written warning, and an explanation of why their behavior pattern is impacting your business. Act concerned for their well-being, ask if there’s anything you can do to help them not call in so often 
Sorry, no disrespect intended but I can’t believe a question like this is even asked.Seems like if you are a manager or supervisor that you would know you respect people’s privacy &amp; not assume there’s more to them saying they are sick—other than they are sick &amp; need the day off. Having said this (however), I’m recalling a co-worker who every year I worked with her (about 5 years) took all of her personal days (no crime there—but you could bank your personal days if you wanted to) and took all of her sick days. I had my doubts but I would never bring this up to anyone, her, our manager, co-wor 
I honestly think this isn't a good thing to do. It makes for a bad work environment. Taking off when you are sick isn't just a human right, but also will help your whole job site. Nobody wants germs spread around the office, and your employee will not be at their best if they aren't feeling well. It doesn't really matter what is wrong with them, if they have time off to use, and they decide they want to use it, that's their prerogative. My first job was at a gas station. I went over two years without ever calling in sick, but one night I woke up with the flu. I had a high fever and was puking.  
Sick days are a benefit belonging to the employee. It's not my job to audit how they use them. Here's the the thing: I only employ adults. I trust them not to come in sick and spread their germs and create an unsafe environment, and I also trust them not to take ‘mental health days' when they know it's going to screw me. I trust the people who are at work to be similarly understanding because they'll be granted the same consideration. So when Joe calls in and says he's not coming in he's completely free to tell me that it's because his girlfriend dumped him. If I know something he doesn't, I mig 
No, let me explain why. I get extremely bad menstrual cramps, abnormally bad, the first day of my cycle off birth control is spent curled up in bed with a hot water bottle on my stomach and a washcloth on my head. I’ve been bad enough that I’ve puked on multiple occasions. My cramps are debilitating, I cannot function on the first day of my cycle unless I am on birh control and even then I have to take pain killers for cramps. My cycle first started getting this bad when I was in middle school, no one believed my cramps were as bad as they were until I puked at school because my period started t 
For a brief spate of time (1year) I was Head of Department in a government agency. Part of this work meant I was also the HR Manager. I monitored staff sick for patterns and genuinity dependent on time of year and local sickness and health issues that affected the island I worked in. If an employee called sick I would always send a Company Dr to their house. Herein lies the most important aspects that people just do not realise so I guess I am spilling the beans. Sending a Dr to a staff members house is not to see if they are sick. It is to ensure they are at home as they must be at home during th 
I would first approve the sick leave, and then ask for more, not to “probe”, but to show that I care, and see how I or the rest of the team can support this employee, both professionally and personally. If we see this “didn’t feel good” as an excuse, we already have the prejudice. Why do we have this prejudice? Maybe this one is indeed one of the lowest performers in our team. In that case, why do we still keep this employee? Or maybe I’m just a terrible boss, in which case it doesn’t matter, I’m doomed to fail anyway. We either trust our employees (to some extent, like with these trivial things 
I have been two kinds of managers. The first, I was young, overly stressed and worried about meeting timelines. So I would insist my people work too many hours and not take enough breaks. I thought because I was still working more hours, that they would be fine, it wasn’t a big deal. They took too many sick days and I just knew they were lying. I didn’t do or say anything. They were stressed, emotional, and hated me. Even when I tried being understanding and help with patience. I stressed them the f#%^ out. I was stressed out as well, but it was my choice. I shouldn’t have overworked myself eit 
&amp;If you are a licensed practicing physician, and you are that employee's doctor, you can probe that employee’s medical issues only with the employee’s agreement. How much less do you as a layman, boss or not, have to probe such delicate matters? Do you really even want to know? You know federal law even makes it a felony for someone to reveal anyone's medical information without their authorization, right? That's not the case here, but it makes it very clear that medical information is very private info by law. What would enable you to make medical judgments, anyway? How would you diagnose an il 
I simply say, get better soon, any shit I gotta take care of? No? Great. Yes? Dude, tell me. I don't check. I don't follow the (or any) company's policy either. HR can really kiss my ass on this. I will never monitor sick leave of one my employees if I manage a team. We do have a WhatsApp group in regards of raising any concerns. I always tell everyone the same. I don't care where you do you work (office or not) at what time, all I care about is that you finish your work ahead of any deadline, above and beyond. And that I don't get complaints from others about you. I'm fine with you taking a holi 
It would depend on whether or not the employee was often calling in sick and if they had an underlying health condition I was aware of. I would ask them what’s wrong, just so I can gauge if this was likely to be a one day thing or possibly out for several days as well as to see if I can offer any advice other than the generic rest+fluids. If the employee refuses to say what is wrong I would not push it. Maybe they are stuck on, or hugging the toilet, or else have VERY bad cramps this month and are not comfortable with being that explicit with me. That’s cool, everyone is entitled to their priva 
I never bothered to probe as to why they wanted the day off, because what good was it going to do, I just accepted it and went on with the day, I had different ways of dealing with these issues, if they were the type who wasn't a very good worker anyhow I would already be finding ways to let them go, if they weren't good workers and they were calling in sick that just sealed the deal with me, and soon they would be gone so why bother asking, but if they were great workers and they called in sick once in a while I'd say why not they are a hell of a worker they deserve a call in every once in a  
Nope, you have just as much right asking why they’re sick just as much as you have the right to ask who they slept with last night and how often they pleasure themselves (you can’t btw). BUT, depending on where you are, you can legally request a sick certificate for days of absence if they want their sick pay (depending on workplace agreements that is). People unfortunately get sick, they don’t plan of waking up feeling like garbage. If it becomes habitual though, I would say to thoroughly look at their actual work as well as look at any company policies they aren’t following. (If you feel the e 
From an employee point of view. There are many reasons why an employee might call in saying that they don’t feel well aside from actually being sick. Situations crop up all the time that require people to handle things in person. Many companies are not at all understanding of the fact that there are things outside of work that an employee must attend to and can only be done during normal work hours. So employees use sick time to handle those things to their own detriment. You never know what an employee might be going through at home. Financial situations, family crises among other things. Depen 
I’ve been the manager for lots of people and people seem to enjoy working with me and here is my assessment of why that is… I like people and I make them feel valued. I make them feel valued because they are valued. When you value the people that work for you, they tend to feel cared about and providing you can present your objectives in a way they believe in, they will follow you to hell and back to help deliver them. Foster an environment where people are excited to spend time with you, they’re excited to come to work with their team every day and you help them to feel successful and they wil 
Way back, when I was promoted to my first supervisory position, I was sent to a a week long training program. Regarding employees that call-in sick or ask to leave early because they are not feeling well - we were told that we are not doctors. It was not our role to determine whether a person was well enough to work. If we insisted that someone come to or remain at work when that person said they were sick, then if anything happened to that person because of our insistence that they work, the company could be held liable. Instead, we were trained to document attendance. Each job exists because  
Despite the fact that being self-employed means that I have to pay more in taxes, that I don't receive health benefits, and that I don't get paid time off, it's still completely worth it knowing that I don't have to feel guilty taking time off. In the U.S., for some reason we've created a culture that prioritizes work over personal health, and I just don't understand it. Whether you need a mental health day, you have the flu, or the roads are bad after a blizzard, you have the right as a human being to decide to put yourself ahead of your work responsibilities at that time. I think that it's eas 
Of course I accept it as given because to do otherwise would necessitate a violation of the law. In Canada (Ontario specifically but most jurisdictions in Canada are the same) I can’t ask for details of their sickness or challenge them on it at all, as that is personal information to which I am not entitled. Only if the absence extends beyond a few days (we generally use 3) are we entitled to ask for any sort of supporting documentation, which is generally a doctor’s note. Even then the note need not contain any details other than the treating doctor advising that the employee was unable to co 
Answer from Ontario coming in! Here, you don’t get “sick days” per se (unless the company provides them!), but you do get a certain number of days a year that you can use to not be at work that the company can not do anything about (by law) other than not pay you. You get three days for personal illness, three days for family responsibilities and two for bereavement leave, for a total of 8 unpaid days off a year. Obviously these days are intended to be used for those purposes, but there is nothing I can do about an employee who uses a “sick day” to, say go to a theme park. The caveat to this is th 
Frankly, your health diagnosis is none of your employer's business. Illness does not always mean physical symptoms, as many with mental problems can attest. A doctor's note is as simple as a phone call to discuss your symptoms with a nurse or the doctor. The nurse then fills out a form the size of a prescription that says something to the effect of: ### 02/22/2021 To Whom It May Concern: My patient, Whatever Nobody, is under my care and may return to work or school on 02/26/2021. HIPPA prohibits the release of Personal Health Information. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific diagnosis. Should Wha 
Thank you for your question. I had an opportunity to be HR Manager for a company with 5 outlets and about 190 give or take employees. It was a new position for the company. I started out meeting every employee. I called it conversations with team members. I kept notes in files. Who family is. Anything important. I was received with suspicion and even aggressive resistence until I “helped” a few (maybe 4 individuals) with some personal issues. It shocked me to find out how little they expected from the company. I used my own money to solve two problems. Very little. R500 tops. 2007 rates. Personal pro 
I would accept the answer. I might or might not have personal suspicions otherwise—such as for employees who are magically ‘sick’ every Monday—but aside from clear patterns of absenteeism, no, I would not ask for details. I would want any employee with a chronic illness or medical need to discuss that with me so that their needs could be planned for. For example, an employee who has a weekly appointment with a doctor—I wouldn’t need to know the type of doctor or what the appointments were for, but I would want to know the day and time, because I would be accountable for that employee’s presence 
The first thing a manager should be is, caring. We are all human and all can and will fall ill. So, you show that you care by asking what is wrong not only to know but because you really care. Then you ask if the person needs assistance to get to the doctor, ask if you can perhaps call someone or get the secretary to help make an appointment. By now you will form the conversation know how serious the illness actually is. You, because of your concern insist that they get medical help. Once this caring is sorted you can quickly ask if there is any important work that you should know of and or that yo 
Quite honestly the excuse doesn’t matter. They could be sick, just not want to come to work, or abducted by space aliens. What matters is someone you were depending on to be at work isn’t there and you have to make other arrangements. Our attendance policy doesn’t differentiate as to reason. Full time associates are granted sick time and it is possible for them to use it within the parameters of the attendance policy. It is also possible for them to be in violation of the policy even though they have sick time. It’s not for me to make a decision as to if a associate is sick enough to not come to 
No, I would not probe for a more detailed answer. It's my employee's right to take a sick day, and they don't need to tell me why. They could need a mental health day and might not appreciate me probing further. I'll tell you how I handle the situation. If a member of my team calls me to say they “didn't feel good” when they woke up so they're taking a sick day, I say: “Sorry you're not feeling good, is there anything I can do to help?” My team, knowing me well, know that this offer to help can range from anything from having them some soup delivered, taking painkillers over when they've had none 
I would not probe for a more detailed answer. That would probably be illegal or at least set me up for a complaint to my management. I suffer from an ‘invisible illness’, one that is real and diagnosed and which I take regular medication for, but is not obvious to anyone who sees me. As a result, I have used more sick days than I would want, and I worry about not having enough available if I were to get something more serious. But these were bona fide sick days. I am also extremely private about the nature of my illness (hence the anonymous answer) and really don’t like to talk about it. So when  
Sickness isn’t “excuse”, it’s the reason. By saying “excuse”, you already made your mind to say that your employee is filthy lazy bas*ard. I was chief of IT sector in one company and whenever one of my under colleagues called me and told me that he is ill, I would say: “I wish you recover soon, call me when you know more for me to know when you’ll return.” And that’s it. I never doubted in their honesty, but do you know why? It was because I knew my employees. I knew them as workers and as persons. What kind of boss is the one who doesn’t know his employees? It’s s*ithole who cares about profi 
In the USA the employer does not have the right to know what is “wrong” with an employee who calls in sick . If the employer doubts the employee, believes they are abusing their sick time, then they have 3 options: Request an excuse from the employee’s medical provider (you may not require a diagnosis on the note, only when the employee can return to work); 2) implement progressive discipline, if you believe that employee has demonstrated a pattern of abuse of time; 3) Terminate that employee, if that employee is “at will” and not otherwise part of an ADA protected class, or otherwise entitled 
I’d tell them “feel better.” Does it matter? Maybe they’re truly physically sick. Or maybe they just needed a “mental health” day. “don’t feel well” is just as legit if it’s other than something regarding physical wellness. Either way, they’re the ones who have to manage their own PTO. If they use it all up in constantly calling in sick, they’ll eventually run out and have to do without. If they’re that bad, they’re going to “out” themselves in other ways anyway. I used to work with a person who did call in a lot. But, she was fantastically intelligent and a ridiculously hard worker (totally abov 
As a rule, no you don’t probe. If the employee has sick days they can use then let them use them. If you probe for more do it passively, “Oh my are you alright?” That’s only if you have that kind of relationship where you share intricate details of each others lives outside work. “I don't feel good.” Might sound a bit childish could mean a lot of things. It could be a physical ailment or a mental one. Where the latter sin’t one you want to push to understand unless it’s your job to understand . If the employee does this every week or every other day there should be a conversation about it with  
Well - I think there are several different answers to this - 1 - I run a professional services firm. We often travel to client offices and what not but the presence of our employees isn’t always super necessary to a smoothly running office. We also believe in treating our employees like adults. If an adult wakes up and feels sick, or is even just sick of seeing my face and wants to take a day off, go ahead. Nothing is really impacted even if they were scheduled to be at a client. They are in essence just postponing work until later. I have no problem with that if the employee shows that they are  
This answer depends on some factors that aren’t apparent in your question, namely: Does the employee habitually call in sick?Would your request for additional information violate HIPAA?What does your Employee Handbook detail as far as Lost time due to Illness?Is the employee salaried or hourly?If this is an exemplary employee who does not frequently call in sick, wish them a speedy recovery. If this employee falls under the Employee Handbook requirements for requiring a Doctor’s Note due to lost time due to Illness, fall back on that. (If your company does not have a clearly defined Employee Han 
Legally, you cannot probe. Some employers have a policy that if you’re out three days (that’s just an example), you must provide a doctor’s note. I know people who work for the public school system. As a teacher you receive sick leave and two personal days a year. You don’t accrue annual leave because you contract for 187 days a year. If you’re out more than eight days you have to submit a doctor’s excuse. This was implemented to stop teachers from taking 50+|- days a years - unfortunately, that’s true. The new administration monitors FB. These same two teachers have a habit of taking vacation 
I had a supervisor who literally did this. If you called in sick, he would ask for a list of symptoms, and then make you feel guilty until you (hopefully) changed your mind. Hardly anyone took sick days under him, and we all just came in and infected one another and our students, who had no problems taking sick days. Then we got a new vice principal who was incredibly relaxed about such things, didn’t question it at all. A lot more people started taking their sick days under him - even if they weren’t actually sick. The first guy was definitely in the wrong. We are all adults, and if someone says  
I wouldn't. There really isn't any good reason to probe further than they tell you. Reality is that its none of your business what the reason is. Document the incident and move on with your day. True story. Years ago (early 1980s), I had a coworker who called in sick. He was very detailed in his illness over the phone. You know the whole I'm sick in bed and have been vomiting with diarrhea. We worked a night shift. He decided that anyone who he would know would be at work. He went to the local tennis courts and ended up meeting up with one of the managers. They played tennis that night. The next d 
that would make you a bad boss.if you call to make an appointment with a doctor, the receptionist may ask you “if you are able” to give more information. you can say no, and they will book the appointment. if the receptionist doesn’t have a right to demand you disclose the nature of your illness, then your boss certainly can’t. you can just tell them. I am not well enough to work. check your contract, there is a certain number of days you can “self certify” for. beyond that, you will be expected to get a note from the doctor, saying you are not fit for work. the reason why you are not fit for wor 
You have to accept it at first - as that is basically all the info they are giving. However when they are back I would sit down with them 1–2–1 and just ask if there was anything wrong etc. You have to tread a bit carefully as sometimes people are vague when bad things happen… for example someone who worked for me once just text me to say ‘cant come in, something’s come up’ which at face value is poor practice, but when they did return I found out a close relative of theirs had died, and obviously in situations such as that people can be coy. However, if they cant come up with any reason etc then 
What is ailing them isn’t your business. The more you stay out of ‘probing’ them and more concern you show for their well-being, the more well-liked you’ll be and better output you’ll get from employees. When I was young and had my first job I had asked to not be scheduled because I needed my wisdom teeth pulled. My supervisor scheduled me anyway. I called her to let her know, she didn’t believe me and demanded I come in. I showed up right after surgery, mouth full of gauze, spitting blood into a cup so I could “prove” my time off was legit. That always stuck with me and I made sure I would neve 
I would not probe and respect their decision. If they are a serial sicknote person, then there are company procedures to sort that out. Maybe they’re really sick? Maybe they’re not. That’s not really the point at this point in time. The simple fact is, if someone is sick you don’t want them at work, making other people sick. If they have flu or some sort of infection, let them stay at home. I’m fortunate enough that where I work, I can work from home easily (in fact, it’s encouraged and I do this once a week). If I’m ever ill, I tell my co-workers and boss that I’m working from home. If I am that  
i would say …fine. i am human too and know that work is slavery for a bit of money, its not necessarily something people love, and i am grateful tht they come in all the time and make me money. they spend their days making me more money than they themselves make, and sometimes they dont feel like it, so i would be ok with them rining in saying they dont feel well. that said, if they did it all the time, and it became a real regular occurance, i would have a word and say…hey you have had 6 sick days in the past 2 months, is there a problem, as if this continues it could become problematic to me. o 
I was a foreman and If someone called in sick I never questioned them about the nature or their illness, etc. What we did look for were signs of abuse of sick time such as an employee who regularly called in on Mondays or Fridays. Our organization also had an occurrence system that tracked the number of times a person called in sick in a year. If a person had too many occurrences they would be counselled and told if they had a chronic condition they should consider filing FMLA paperwork. Although we did have a progressive disciplinary system that required us to first formally counsel offenders 
I had the opportunity to work for one of the greatest managers there was, sales of coarse. One thing he tought me, as a sales person, you want to be in the best frame of mind you can be. So your customers dont pick up on your dissatisfaction or down, negative attitude. If that person numbers are good or ok, but they have confirm good prospects, then say sure. If the not good just, just ask them if they could catch up on some of there paperwork that's due or updated there electronic records on whatever system you may use. People forget, sales people are paid on commission, so it's there money. It's  
Trust but verify when this happens with some regularity. The finesse you bring is what separates merely OK managers from the great ones. Is it possible to question co-workers without them feeling questioned? Perhaps as a manager, you keep strict arms-length relationships. This makes it hard to probe. But if you are one of those managers who learn the names of significant others and the kids, and share same about yourself, no problem probing with a gentle “what’s going on, Maria?” If warranted by repeat incidents, do you have a budget to deploy a private investigator? In my corporate life, I alway 
I work for a large hospital system (in patient and out patient facilities) and we operate on a point system. You are given up to 12 points for the year and everybody starts at 0. You get 1 point for an unexcused absence, 1/2 point for a missed clock in/out, and a 1/2 point for not getting your work in on time. It is amazing how well it works. It eliminates the need for management to determine whether an absence is excusable or not. It is solely up to the employee if they want to use up their points. If you go over your 12 before the year is out, you are put on probation till the end of the year 
I work at a University. I’ve worked in HR at this University in the past. I know quite a bit of the do’s and dont’s when an employee calls in. Realistically, all we can do is say “thanks for calling. I hope you feel better. Let us know if there’s anything we can do for you.” That is it. No need to probe into their personal lives. If it becomes a habit, then HR should be documenting it, but that is it. If it becomes chronic absenteeism, then you and the employee need to have a meeting and find out if something is going on and if they need assistance. You may need to get HR involved, but only if 
Unless it was a routine thing with them (i.e., happening once a week or even once a month), I’d accept their answer. And I probably wouldn’t probe for a more detailed answer, but I’d certainly have a brief talk with them after they returned to work. My manager continually thought people were just faking it, or, even if we had a doctor’s note, she told us if we couldn’t get someone to cover our shift, we still had to come in. She forced the other sales lead to come into work after she’d called in sick that morning, and my then co-worker seemed unwell, but my boss was convinced the girl was just 
I wasn’t the supervisor, but I worked the midnight shift in the maintenance dept. of a hospital, so any time one of the maintenance people called out I got the call. When they called they would start to tell me why and I was quick to stop it. I would say hey, you don’t need to tell me why, it really isn’t any of our business to know that. They all seemed to appreciate, except my boss. he would always ask why they called out and I told him none of our business. He got pretty annoyed with me every time it happened. I asked him if his HVAC license suddenly become a doctorate and he was going to g 
Thankfully the company I work for has policies to handle these situations. My policy for sick calls is to take them at face value. I'm a manager, not a slave owner, so I can't make people come to work. What I can do is determine if she has used up her allocated PTO (paid time off) days. Legally in USA employers do not have to give paid time off, so when they do, they can (and most do) stipulate that sick days come out of your annual off days. If you have 10 days a year, I don't care if you use them for vacations or to stay home sick. If you're sick 10 days, then you simply don't get to go on va 
I’m not a doctor so I have to take their word for it. I’d probably ask what was wrong and if they really couldn’t face work, and if they said they couldn’t I’d tell them to take it easy and see them tomorrow. I hope I wasn’t the sort of boss that people would skive off to avoid; if people do that a lot then the problem is with the cvompany, not the staff. Besides that, I don’t want people coming to work if they’re going to work badly because they can’t keep their mind on the job, and importantly I don’t want people coming in and spreading their germs about. I have on occasion sent someone home b 
I love my federal job. I don’t even have to call my boss and talk to them about my being sick. I just enter it into a federal inhouse computer system from home and if anyone has questions they can call me. It’s been 13 years .. no one has called me yet. And guess what? I’ve never abused it - not once. In fact, I’ve been called to STAY HOME because I showed up sick and didn’t want to call out because I felt guilty putting coworkers in a position to cover my post. I have more than 5 weeks combined vacation / sick time I’ve never used. GREAT MANAGERS are right. Treat your employees like humans and t 
I'm a supervisor in healthcare. While personally I wish them wellness, professionally, I don’t care about the reason. These are adults choosing to call sick, questioning their truthfulness isn't in my job description. There are policies in place to account for these things. Whether it is a day of hooky, a mental health day, or one is physically sick, it doesn't matter; it is considered unschduled PTO, and it’s a ding against the employee. X amount of dings for any combination of things, including attendance, will lead to a verbal, then a written, then termination. A verbal makes one ineligible 
Depends on the employee. Some just take a sicky because they feel like it. We know who they are. We know a lot of the time they are not sick and just want a day in bed or down the pub… actually caught one down the pub (more than) once, he ended up taking it as holiday. If the employee has been struggling with issues either at home or work or if they are normally a good employee then we try to do everything we can to help and if that is having a few days at home then that is OK. Its rare to have someone who goes off sick for the heck of it if you are an employer who is fair and treats their staff  
With some of the organisations I worked for, it was common knowledge that at appraisal time, those looking for top performer status would put on their powerpoints, “Sick Days in period: 0 (or a low number).” That filtered through to the rest of the workforce who basically didn’t participate in the other culture of taking sickies. So, to answer the question, I might ask for symptoms, if they haven’t already been given. Perhaps a line such as, “You don’t sound healthy, just speaking to you. You should probably get checked in at the GP as soon as you can.” It’s in my interests to know a diagnosis,  
Good Morning, Mr. Shapiro. Thank you, sir, for asking me to reply to your question. I will never call a person a liar…until they prove themselves to be a liar. I would accept, at face value, the employee is ill. I would appreciate them NOT arriving at work…and “sharing” their bacterial or viral infection. It is bad enough one employee is indisposed. To have the entire crew out ill, would be absolutely disastrous. However, I WOULD keep track, just how many times that employee calls in sick. If and when their absences become intolerable, I would request the employee have a wellness examination cond 
For one boss, I felt ill and left early on a Friday afternoon - and he read me the riot act on the following Monday - not good Another occasion, I recall sharing with him I intended to take my wife for a long weekend to a place I discovered he had already been, and he told me about some interesting places to visit while there. We didn’t actually go to those places - as we had other plans - but when I arrived at work on Monday he asked me “how did the weekend go” - meaning - how far did I get in my work? I walked him into the other room where he had written on a white board in his own hand the p 
Writing anonymously for the sole reason that it involves my current job and you never know who is stalking you online. Not intending to say anything bad about the workplace but better to not risk any issues. I have to admit the current answers are far more forgiving than my workplace. Standard policy is generally to reject the call-in and the person attempting to call in is informed that they must show up or it will be considered a “No call - No show”. Of course there are ways to try get your call in through such as calling during 3rd shift to speak with one of the overnight managers. They will  
As someone who lost her job because of this, I have to interject a different perspective. I was in my probationary period, which was 90 days. We were allowed no unplanned/unexcused absences during the first 90 days. I was training with a Team Lead, so I would sit at her desk with her and type on her computer or I would shadow her and observe. She came in sick. Extremely sick. I told my manager I did not want to get sick. She said too bad so sad. And, I got sick. Really sick. I called in for a Friday off. I felt better and returned Monday. They insisted that HR would decide if I would be fired, b 
one thing’s got nothing to do with the other, I always wanna know ‘what’s wrong’ when ANYTHING says ‘something’s wrong’; I see a cat sneeze, I wanna know “what’s up with that”. I got my first Business license back in 1983, didn’t get rid of my last one until 1996 - so I’ve been a “Sole Proprietorship” “Boss” for a few years in addition to occasional stints as “mere employee”. So Anyone ever called up ‘unable to work’, and a few even SHOWED UP to explain, I ALWAYS Asked for explanation, but again, simply because I happen to be “Noseybody” interested in “What’s Up With That”. The FIRST Thing I to 
It’s not a wise thing for an Employer or Manager determine or to probe an employee when they call in sick, nor should the manager or boss push the employee to come in even if for just half the day as in some cases I have been asked, the point is if you are legitimately not feeling well then you need to take a sick day and the Employer just needs to accept that. Most Employers can take a look at the track record of the employee and see if this happens a lot and make notes to later confront the employee with a warning. Most Companies even Restaurants knows this will happen so they have allotted  
In a case like this, judging how often cases like this occur is the best bet to finding an ideal solution. Employees are allowed a certain amount of prescribed sick days and or personal days per year. You can probe for a little more details, but it’s best to simply wish them well, and expect to see them back in the office the next day. Regardless of whether they are actually sick or not, or well enough to come into work when an employee calls in with this kind of reasoning, it’s best to simply accept it for what it is and move on. You can have HR keep tallies of the absenteeism, and keep running 
Wow! A ton of good answers. I am a trust person. If someone has generally good attendance and calls in sick, I accept it. If there is a pattern of abuse in using leave, that is an issue to work with HR and have HR work with the employee on what acceptable use of sick leave (and paid time off) is. We had an employee once who was sick every Monday after accumulating eight hours of sick leave or vacation. HR agreed it was an abuse, the employee was counseled, and eventually learned that they could not work 40 hours a week, week after week, and left. Employees also should realize that a missed day  
I always trusted my team members enough to accept their word without probing. So if one of them needed a day off for whatever reason, they had it. To the best of my knowledge, none of them ever abused this privilege, although I have my suspicions that in a few cases their “sick days” were actually spent in other ways. It didn’t matter, because their productivity never suffered and was probably even better because they felt in control. In addition, in some teams, it seemed that there would always be one person who would be the “canary in the coal mine” (if you will excuse the metaphor), meaning  
Like everything else in life-it’s all about the amount of integrity capital you have. If you’re a guy or gal that’s a known hard working dedicated employee…I’m not going to ask many questions about them calling in for a sick day. I give them alot of rope. If you’re a newbie, I probably don’t question alot the first time unless there’s a reason to be suspicious. In time you’ll earn my faith in your integrity if you’re worthy of it. If you’re known to try to dodge work whenever possible, it’s going to take more info. Pretty simple really. It’s not like a sick day once in a blue moon is going to b 
Yes, they already evaluated the situation and decided they were, for whatever reason, too sick to come in to work. If they did tell you, do you think you are qualified to debate the seriousness of the issue and convince them otherwise? If they say they are sick, leave them alone! If they are feigning illness for another reason, it will inevitably affect their productivity, and you have avenues at that point to look at remedies. I'm personally not a clock watcher… I hate it being done to me and I won't do it to others. If you complete/exceed your assignments, don't pawn stuff on others, etc. and  
I would look in the mirror, at my role, and at my employees and my relationship with them and ask why my reaction is that this call is “an excuse”. Other than that, unless the employee has a pattern of abusing sick time, just give the person the sick time and leave it at that. If you have concerns, follow company policy or talk to HR, if you have that function. The employee’s health and medical situation is not your business and it may actually be illegal for you to pry into specifics. If there are concerns about job performance or the absence is creating a work issue, handle them separately. T 
I will answer this from my perspective as a Works Council member. In my country rules and regulations on this matter may differ from where you live. You might be a manager but you are not a doctor. When someone calls in sick, make a note of that and wish them all the best. When you recognize a pattern (say, someone turns out be be sick every Monday morning on the early shift) then you should consult with the medical service provider of your company and let them investigate. If you can not access that kind of service you might adress the employee stating that you see that he calls in sick very of 
I’d accept that as a reason…however I would ask for more detail so I know when they’re likely to be back. I’m a doctor. In the UK, in your first two years as a doctor, you change jobs every four months. When I was working on general surgery, I thought I had a cold. My supervisor disagreed and removed my appendix (spoiler: she was right!). A few months later I had a stomach bug so called in sick…even though I’d changed jobs (to paediatrics- no prizes for guessing where I caught the big!) the others knew I’d misdiagnosed appendicitis as a cold…and promptly suggested that I should come in to be pr 
I would take the following views: If this is first time, I would let it go and wish him or her well ;If this is habitual, then I would advise him or her over the phone that I would like to meet with them on their return to the office. Then you should have a face to face and decide what you would want to say and penalise the person or just listen in to their story. If it’s a good staff, it could be - parents or kids being ill, a recent financial crisis, really being sick or the car needs servicing…..one of these. Remember we are human and in some countries there are little or no services on week
My experience as employee (and not as employer) has been pretty positive during the last 9 years in the company where I am currently working.If I don’t feel well, I just text/email the boss and say “Sorry, I don’t feel well today.” I might add some details if I want (“Maybe it’s flu” “I have upset stomach” etc) but that’s up to me.The answer has always been “Sorry to hear that. Take care and rest. See you tomorrow”.Company policy and general rules (at least in Finland) are that the first 2 days of sick leave don’t need a medical statement. From third day, I need to call/visit a doctor and g 
If you are the boss and one of your employees calls in the morning and says that they "didn't feel good" when they woke up that morning so they're taking a sick day, would you accept that excuse as given or would you probe for a more detailed answer? I’m not in this situation, because I’m a self-employed sole trader. However, I can think of a number of times when I’ve felt a bit rough in the morning, delayed going to work, then gone to work around lunchtime. I guess that those rare rough mornings might be if my immune system is fighting off a bug that’s trying to take hold. Probing an employee fo 
It depends on the situation and you need to follow your company’s policy on this. My current employer allows 1 sick day and then you need to get a medical certificate, or 5 individual sick days per year. So if you have the flu and take 3 days off you would need a medical cert. Or if you have a day off each month for 5 months its all good but the next day off you will require a medical cert. I accept what they are saying. I may have seen photos on fb of them drunk as a skunk last night, but if they ring saying they have gastro then all good. Thanks for letting me know, do you need anything, get  
I think having trust between colleagues and your employees are one of the top priorities. So yes you should trust them on their word. You may ask them a few questions to make if everything was alright and that it wasn’t serious and make sure the work that you may have asked them to do it to be due on the right time. So if the employee isn’t feeling well and called I’m sick for a day, they should be able to be organized knowing that they may misse dout at work. A detailed answer would be more better because some may say they’re sick but actually they’re just sick of working or just feel lazy or  
Being a good boss means that you have enough brain cells to rub together to make good decisions. You cannot predict real or fabricated illness. You give everyone the same level of trust that when they call in sick whether they have the flu, need a mental health day or have an errand to run. Yes I would like everyone to be honest about the non-sick reasons for calling in sick but I also have common sense. If this is an irregular occurrence I take then at their word. Part of your job as boss is to pay attention to trends in your employee’s work and that is not limited to sick days only. Overtime,  
I accepted whatever was said at face value - showing concern but not probing. There were built in procedures if absences followed a certain pattern or self-certified sick days exceeded a limit. That said I found it amusing sometimes when I was pretty sure someone was pulling a fast one. If someone sounded pretty normal than I could almost be sure that were telling the truth - they just didn’t feel well enough to come in that day and maybe the next. The ones I did not believe would call and sound like they were on death’s door - talking slowly as if each word was an effort with grunts and moans eve 
There are laws. They probably vary by state. It might depend on the employee. If someone always comes through for me and then once in three years doesn’t, you’d better believe I’m not harassing them over it, especially since they did call. I think generally employers do what they think they have to to not wind up in court. I think bosses, if they want info, generally make others call on their behalf. Would I want more information if I could get it? Yes. I’d want to know if something was going around and I’d be annoyed that a better answer was not offered, forcing me to ask. Would I get rid of t 
I would probably probe a bit, but there are limits to how much information I can require. I’d then note the absence. That way, I can see whether there are trends in how often and at what times they call in “just not feeling well”. If it happens a lot, or there is a pattern, like htey always “don’t feel good” on Modays or Fridays, I would have a friendly chat with them about that. I would also keep the HR department informed. Any disciplinary consequences will have to go through them. Most workplaces only require a doctors note from the third day of illness onwards, which makes sense. But it does 
Some make the point that it's impersonal and rude to probe. I would suggest that you just do it in a nice way. Those who are honestly or having difficulty will have no problem elaborating on it. You can always apologize if this approach gets a bad reaction. Businesses don't run on favours and kind words. If your staff can't show up reliably and feel that minor ailments or trivial home dramas stop them coming in you need to screen against it. You don't want to lose good staff to a case of sniffles or Monday blues that turns into depression, know your staff and be there for them if they need it.  
My response, “Thank you for letting me know. Hope you feel better! I look forward to having you back.” I don’t care to know the details of why they don’t feel good. I respect their privacy.Why assume it is an excuse? If this is an ongoing issue then I would be more concerned about why they don’t want to be at work. What caused them to lose interest? Scheduling a meeting to sit down and talk with them will help. Here are some questions:What do they like and not like about their role?What obstacles are in the way of them doing their job well?What is one thing you can do to help them?Where do they
If you are the boss and one of your employees calls in the morning and says that they "didn't feel good" when they woke up that morning so they're taking a sick day, would you accept that excuse as given or would you probe for a more detailed answer? The first time the employee did that I would trust them. As long as there was no critical dependency on them being there or completing something, I would just thank them for calling and wish them a speedy recovery, and that would be the end of it.

Ah yes. One of the benefits of employment. Free “medical” second opinion regardless of the problem. Personal “care" from the boss. The problem with this decision is called bias. Male bosses will not “understand” “women" problems. Matured bosses will assume their young employees are robots (All these kids are Decepticons. When your backs are turned, they will change into troublemakers and fly). Young bosses will regard “matured” employees as having limited days left in this world. As most answers have covered, if you get it right, you have caught out one employee and not put an end to such scheme 
Let’s looj it this from the other side. My partner always goes into work, even when he should be at home with the flu. The management &amp; HR gathered around his desk &amp; sent him home, he had a cough for over 4 weeks!! But because he was clearly not well &amp; could be coughing and spluttering. They sent him home, his first sick note from the doctor ever. He has been employed since 1985 with various companies. So when someone just can’t face the day. They will say something like I don’t feel to good. It happens it’s called life. When they return ask them about mental health? - I am diagnosed with depress 
In France, when you “take a sick day” you must have a doctor’s certificate otherwise it’s “unjustified absence” and legally it’s not the same. As long as you have a doctor’s certificate, or even declare you are sick, you absolutely DON’T HAVE to explain what’s happening to you. If your boss asks you “you tell me you’re sick but what’s going on ?” if you’re not very close friend, he can have some troubles because he is ABSOLUTELY NOT allowed to ask you about your medical situation (it can create discrimination if someone has more health issue than another)/ So you absolutely have to have your doc 
We don't know our next step what will bring to us, will we be in well- condition or bad ones. Some people see this situations as a two different ways. Some show tolerance, while others show cruelty. If I were in a such a position, first of all I will take my decision depending on the employee performance and work history “ If “ the employee used to do it with manipulative attitude for sure I won't let it go easily. In the other shore if the employee has not make any excuses before with a clear background work history I will deal diplomatically and give the permission, but in the same time I will 
I had one employee who whenever she earned a sick day would take the following Monday off. I had Saturday office hours 2 times a month that lasted until all scheduled patients were seen. We usually finished by early afternoon. She needed to work only once a month and could trade with the other person who did the job on the alternate Saturday. My other employees who knew I never checked up on why someone took a sick day. And we had many “child is ill” sick days; told me about the Monday illness and the fact that when this employee was working a Saturday, that Saturday was always light and ended 
I accept the fact that people get sick. I do too. I do not want employees around customers who are sick anymore than customers around employees that are sick. I do not need any more information. I do not want anymore information. If the employee is gone too frequently, then I might probe prior to deciding to terminate. I will get upset if the employee uses being "sick" as a cover for looking for work elsewhere. I make no secret they I consider myself and my business as a training ground to help people move up in the world. I appreciate them being honest and letting me know. I can seek a replace 
As a boss I’ve been in this position, and generally, I giave them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they were sick, maybe they just needed a ‘me day’ As long as this wasn’t taken advantage of, it wasn’t too much of a big deal. If it’s constant, then you may need to sit down with your employee and find out what is going on. If they are ill, they need to deal with that. Preferably with the knowledge that thier boss is on their side and willing to work with them so they can get their needs met in as stress free an environment as possible. If they are dissatisfied with their job, then maybe they nee 
I will find this baffling for as long as I live. First and foremost, it is none of your business if they are or are not “too sick” to go to work. Quite literally. None of your business. “Sick” days are benefit time. Nothing more and nothing less. They do not get paid out at the end of the year if unused (at most companies, if separated from planned vacation time) and are considered discretionary. That means; they are to be used at the employees discretion. They don’t need to be sick. They can take a mental health day, an I don’t feel like it day, their kid/spouse/animal/parent/neighbor/plant is s 
I’m a boss but on this day I was the one calling in sick. It was Sunday afternoon and I was sick. So I called the guy who was organizing the briefing I was supposed to be giving to an important client at 8am on Monday morning. I was sick but I felt really bad about ditching the client and the organizer. So when I woke up on Monday morning, I felt ok. So I called my guy and said I would come in. Wasn’t feeling great, but I could make it. (The organizer didn’t get any of my emails or voice mails until after I had started talking) So, about 10 minutes into my briefing, I started repeating myself, m 
Most companies I know today do not have “Sick days”, companies offer “PTO” days, “paid time off” days. Because the time off is not linked to Illness, they can take a day off for what ever reason. If the employee has shown signs of unhappiness, and I suspect they are taking time off for other reasons, like searching for a different job, then I might want to have a conversation with them. To find out what the issues of desiring to leaving are. Maybe I can do something to keep the individual, or maybe I can not do anything and just have to accept the fact people come and people go, That’s life in b 
Its not your place to prove for more information. Yes, people lie, and it happens but there’s nothing you could do in regards to sick time if they are within policy. Your company should have a sick policy, and if the person doesn’t follow the policy etc, then you can deal with that when it arises. Why is it any of your business how or why they are sick. What if it’s embarrassing? What if their anal fissure flared up, or their hemmoroids started bleeding? They wouldn’t want to lie and say they were “sick” maybe just not feeling good was safe enough to not draw any attention. Maybe they needed a 
As a manager, the requirement was to call in to report absence, be it a sick day or personal day. I was not required to ask for nor record the nature of an illiness. If it was volunteered, I would wish him/her a speedy recovery. I had a boss who asked me over the phone what was wrong on one occasion and I responded, “For reasons of my own, it is best I stay in bed today.” I recall being annoyed that he'd asked for details, as I considered having a fibroid tumor that was causing menstrual pain a personal matter I had no obligation to share. The next day I returned to work and he called me into hi 
I accept that as given and tell them “I hope you feel better soon dude” If they are sick I don’t want them anywhere near me or the rest of my team. I work with competent professionals and we can pick up the slack. What I can’t have is one person with the flu getting half my crew sick. That would be devastating to production and could cost the company contracts. If they call in sick and they really aren’t? Oh well, it’s their paycheck. I feel like my company doesn’t give enough paid vacation. So if you need a personal day and you want to use the excuse of it’s coming out both ends, go right ahead 
As a Director of HR that works heavily in employee relations and performance manage, the fact that you have to ask this tell me you need to take a step back and trust your team members. You should never pry into someone’s medical conditions unless you are the HR person handling a medical leave requiring certification. First, your creating your own engagement problem through a culture of distrust. Second, why do you need to know? If its a trending pattern or you have a legitimate reason to question, you can ask for a doctor’s note that indicates that the team member was seen in their office and 
Unless this person does this on a regular basis such as after every major sporting event overseas broadcast in the middle of the night, every Monday morning, the day before or after a public holiday etc then you need to trust your staff. They are adults not children you need to check up on. But if their absence due to sickness is frequent and/or predictable, then you need to find out why. There may be a genuine health reason you are not aware of and for which they need support, or there may be domestic violence or other family or relationship issues, drug or alcohol use etc all of which need he 
Of course, you have to accept it and you do not probe for more details answer. My husband own two retail stores for last 24 years. Our stores open at 9 am seven days a week and at 7 am, employees will call in sick when they have to. My husband will never question anything and always say, okay and feel better. This is how you create a happy place to work for employees and also create good relationship with people who work for you. As you know, anything can happen with anyone at any time. Sometimes employee will wake up with fever, a pink eye, throwing up all through the night, diarrhea, a cold or jus 
Steve: You have to get away from the mindset of finding people doing something wrong. If absense is not an issue with the employee, and considering the employee may also have vacation or personal time, why do you need to “probe” further? Sometimes people have a hard time sleeping, there could be a personal issue with the family and so on. Your “probing” does nothing more than communicate the belief you don’t trust your employee. Frankly, it is none of your business and you need to accept that fact. We no longer have indentured servants. Treat him/her with respect and a very friendly I hope you 
Just accept it. Wish them a speedy recovery. If they’re doing a specific job (not something where other people can just “take up the slack”) then ask if there’s anything pressing that we should get somebody else on. Sick leave is important. Back when I was working, I averaged 3 colds a year. It’s not that bad, but a cold is annoying — I’m sure you’ve noticed. Plus the occasional flu, maybe one year in five. Now that I’m retired, my average is one cold a year, and I’ve had only one very mild flu in the 9 years since I retired. Why? Because people have children. And children get together at school  
As a manager, I don’t ask questions. But, I have also gotten to know all my employees on a personal level, so I generally know what is going on in their lives. If they call in and say they aren’t feeling well, I say ok get some rest, feel better. Now, if they call in 2 days in a row sick, I do tell them I will need a doctor’s note releasing them to come back to work. I run a hotel, so it is much different than a call center or job that doesn’t deal with the public face-to-face. Especially during COVID-19, I can’t have employees in the hall or at the front desk sniffling or coughing while worki 
I think you’d have to take it on a case by case basis. If your employee usually comes to work every day but they call in sick every now and then, you can assume that they are legitimately ill. However, if you notice that an employee is taking more sick leave then most of the other employees and this is affecting their performance - you might want to look deeper. There are a few things you can do in this situation: Check your records and see if there is a pattern. For example, do they always seem to take Fridays or Mondays off?Find out whether there is a serious health issue that is causing them t
I always had enough confidence in my sup-ordinates that if they told me they didn’t feel well enough to come in, I would not question that. In fact, I was a boss who offered my employees a “well day” when we finished a big project where we spent a lot of overtime to complete on time. I didn’t want to see them make themselves sick and to have something to look forward to their “well-day”. Also, they knew I worried about them if they were sick and I’d rather know they were on a well-day. I will say, they never took advantage of the bonus and more often than not, they declined to take it. I guess  
Consider that we are in a pandemic because employees are pressured to work when they are not well. Our society no longer encourages employees to take care of their bodies. Physical and mental health are crucial. Your employee isn’t just a number. They are a person. There are times when you get sick. There are times when if you don’t take a day off, someone else is going to get to know your foot really well through no fault of their own. You don’t need to probe for a detailed answer of their symptoms. If it becomes habitual you can ask them to go to a doctor for their own good and show the note 
In my 30 years of working for various companies, I have never had a boss question me when I’ve called in sick. They have basically told me to take care of myself. If they really need me for something they can call me, and I’ve had some bosses do exactly that, but not to the point where it was abusive. Usually it’s been a quick ten minute call about something they felt needed to be dealt with. As a boss it would not occur to me to question a person saying they are sick. While I have never worked in a situation like Dianne Dawson has where the flu can really screw up a business, I have worked arou 
I assume that they have a legitimate reason when they do call in sick, unless they do this more than once a quarter. Extended illnesses of 3 days require a note from the doctor to confirm. This may be necessary anytime for some jobs, especially those in which illness is separate from vacation days. However, there is no point in having a person go to the doctor for an illness, which they will recover from in a day or two. People have sick days as part of their package for their job for a reason. Often these sick days are simply combined with comprehensive leave, which means they are the same as  
I would definitely not accept that “excuse" as given. I would ask them if there is anything I could do for them, and if they need something. I'd tell them to rest well and take as much time as they need to come back to work refreshed and healthy. I would then proceed to distribute their work load among others including myself if that's possible, so that they are not overwhelmed with work when they come back. Later on that evening or the day after I would text them (so as not to bother them with a phone call) and again ask how they are feeling and if there's anything I can do to help. If their il 
Like Dianne mentioned, it can be disastrous to assume. But I think the analysis needs to be more contextual. What kind of a person is the person who called in sick? Is he the type of guy who would be honest about these things? Is he the type who would lie? Is he the type who would fake illness to go do something else that’s important because he doesn’t want to share that part of his life? If you’re a good manager, you probably know which one it is. Even then though, it’s hard to be sure. What if this time the guy actually is sick? The best way to deal with this is — take them for their word. And  
I don’t think it matters whether you believe it or not, so there would be no point in probing for more details. If your employee wants a day off, they should be entitled to it. I trust that my coworkers understand that by taking a day off they add a burden on the rest of us If they want a day off, I trust that they’ve made this calculation in their head and they have decided it was worth it. Since they are my friends and I want them to be happy, I don’t mind doing a little extra if it means they get to take it easy. Occasionally they’ll return the favor. If I ever suspect I’m being taken advanta 
I think the fact that you describe the reason someone can’t come to work as an excuse, suggests that you think they are making it up. If someone tells you that are not well enough to come to work and explains what is wrong with them, it’s not an excuse, it’s an explanation. Employers cannot force people to work if they are unwell and also should respect their privacy. If you are not a doctor then you really don’t need to probe the condition. You do need to know why someone is off though - simply because if they tell you that they have a communicable disease, you may have to take precautions in 
When I was a Training Manager at Dollar General, I did occasionally have a few (not many) employees that had asked for a sick day due to sickness, no babysitter, or car broke down, etc. It usually would depend on the employee, and if they have a history of call-outs, how well their job performance is overall, things like that. The reason for this is because if someone is always calling in “sick” on a day when we receive truck, for example, this tells me that the employee doesn’t feel like working on the heaviest workload days, versus an employee who rarely calls in sick at all. This is also why 
At one of my jobs, we have a pretty lenient policy with regards to sick time. A lot of us have flexible schedules, too. I am usually the first in on the days I work—-before 8AM. One morning, I woke up around 6 and didn’t feel well. Dizzy and just run down. I sent an email to the necessary people saying I wasn’t feeling well and hoped to be in during the afternoon. Then, went back to bed and didn’t set my alarm. I woke up about two hours later and felt fine. Went into work—-still the first person there. My coworkers were surprised, but happy! Definitely better to have a flexible sick time polic 
I am a boss, not upper brass, but my job involves leading crew(s) and directing work. So: On a professional level, I don’t know, I don’t want to know, I’ll hear what they tell me. . . but all I really need are two pieces of information 1. You’ll be out 2. estimated time back (if it is something like food poisoning where you can pretty well bet the Taco Bell will be out of them in 48 or fewer hours) On a personal level, I care about my subordinates and if they need something .. .

Accept it, unless it's a reoccurring theme. And then, only tell your employee that you are concerned about their health and ask if there is anything you can do. Sure, there are employees who abuse this. But, because someone abuses it doesn't mean you should make everyone else suffer. I had a manager that became very mad at me once because I told her, a month in advance, that I was going to have to take two weeks off after a much needed surgery (one that could have a seriously negative impact on my health if I didn't do it). I was constantly sick because of what this surgery was for; worked thro 
I have not read all the other answers but I have to say that in here, people are not allowed to “probe for details”. It goes under medical secret, and employees have no reason to tell you why they are staying home. In case the problem they have, be it medical or something else, will impact the company on the long run, then they should explain the amount of absence they will need and start planning out a replacement or alternate solution. However, they still don’t owe you any explanation about their health. The only case when a company can intervene into an employee’s health is: They can no longer
We had a man and wife that worked where I worked. Every Friday, they could call in sick. But they could always go gambling all weekend. Finally, our employer made a new rule that if you call in sick, you had to have a dr excuse. That was hard on all of us who didn’t abuse sick leave. That’s also the place where we had 10 sick days a year, but if we didn’t use them, other people could use them. So my sick days would disappear instead of building up. It was the same two women who were “sick” constantly. I would end up with very little sick days because my sick days were taken by the “sick day ban 
I worked in a law firm that gave staff vacation and sick days. A few people would exhaust their vacation days. Then they would use their sick days. Pretty soon they were out of days but still took off time. At that point the firm shareholder ordered the receptionist to call them at home to verify they were ill. No one liked it. Moreover, if they didn’t answer the phone they could have been seeing their doctors. To the question, consider people are adults. Treat them that way. That means not requiring written doctors’ excuses. This is not elementary school and you are not your employees’ truant  
You cannot prove if the employee did or did not feel sick. Probing for more information will only get you more of the same, either more details of the bullshit story or more details of the truth. If I were an employer, I would not need to probe for more information if I were genuinely empathetic to my employees illness, Automatically I would apologize that they are not feeling well and ask what type of symptoms they are experiencing with the hopes to offer some advice towards a more comfortable day and a speedier recover. Probing just makes you look suspicious and a suspicious boss usually has a 
Tell them to rest up, go out and get some fresh air and come back fresh the next day. It’s a huge burden on the “didn’t feel good” person to be asked for details. You are forcing them to lie to you and your interrogation will make them want the next day off too instead of coming back fresh. Accept it at face value and let it slide. The people who probe too much cause more harm than good. They also don’t have enough work which is why they probe in the first place. If you feel the urge to probe then ask yourself if you have enough work to keep yourself busy all day. If not then ask for more work;  
As an employee, temporary , a job I took for a few months to help get over a financial hiatus, about one month into the job I felt quite ill one morning. I rang in and told the boss how I felt,his response was to plead for me to turn in, as there was a urgent need to get a special order despatched, and the firm was short handed, due to others also being off. I really did not feel up to it, but forced myself to go to work. About mid morning, I was instructed to drive the forklift to, move a brand new piece of equipment into the factory, where it was to be built into a larger machine. Driving up th 
Here is Canada you have to accept it and if you call to “check in” on the employee then you can be done for harassment. Which would you prefer someone not driving on all cylinders at their desk with the possibility of it getting worse or someone getting some much needed rest and coming back ready to get the job done. You also can’t ask for what the issues is, they may offer it but you are no a doctor, because if you were you would know all this, so you just have to accept it for what it is….someone isn’t well. 68 viewsMcKenna Henderson, Packer at Costco (2017-present)Answered 2 years ago · Author has 542 answers and 654.9K answer views
Just say ok get better soon. Seriously there might be laws where you live about sick days and you don’t want to accidentally call someone on what you think is a fake if there actually not faking. This is especially important if you work with food as you can get that food contaminated. If it becomes a regular thing then yeah maybe you should talk but if it’s only once in a while just let it go. Also they can tell the truth but not the full truth.

Most businesses provide their employees with paid time off (PTO) hours, typically used for vacation, and many also offer a certain number of sick leave hours. If an employee calls in sick, they should be using their PTO or sick leave hours. If this is the case, even if it is inconvenient, most businesses will give the 1a with minimal complaint. No one plans to be sick or injured. Sometimes they can plan convalescent time for after operations or surgery and give notice beforehand, but in many cases this is not possible. The employees that abuse this are eventually caught anyways. It quickly beco 
One day? You're kidding me… and you're a boss? In the UK the rules are set out in the contract of employment but it's normal to ask for a doctors certificate for longer than 5 working days. But if you have an employee that is taking too much sick leave you should check to see if there's an underlying issue..anxiety depression..a chronic conditioner issues at home…and if so, try to come to an agreement and support them if you can. If there are no issues, you need a reasonable and consistent and stated and legal policy on how much sick leave a person can have… ...and a proper discipline policy. But 
I had this happen quite often as manager of an oilfield service company in Texas. I would always ask, “Are you sick or you just don’t feel good”? This provided the opportunity to offer more details if they wanted. I could usually tell by their response which one it was. If it was possibly a contagious condition, I would encourage them to stay home and thank them for calling and being so considerate of others. I would then mention how valuable their work was to our business and how much their coworkers relied upon them as a crew member. Lastly, I would ask to be kept updated and if things got wor 
Innocent until proven guilty. First of all, I'm not sure it's very legal thing to do, but secondly it's unethical.

What if they just got an incredibly itchy rash on the groin, or a severe case of the runs and can't be more than 10 minutes off the toilet? Just the sanitary concern alone, much less work image with that going on, is enough to let it be.

“If you are the boss and one of your employees calls in the morning and says that they "didn't feel good" when they woke up that morning so they're taking a sick day, would you accept that excuse as given or would you probe for a more detailed answer? “ I would accept it. We allowed people to use vacation and sick days for what we referred to as personal days. Call and take the day off for any reason you choose. Many reasons come up and I would rather they not tell me why than to have them lie. If you see them in a store later in the day, it wasn’t a problem. They have the days they can use it.  
This has happened for me, and I neither just accepted the excuse nor probed for more detail. I told the person that they would have to submit a medical certificate from a doctor with that day’s date along with their timesheet at the end of the pay-period. Failure to do so would result not only in receiving no pay for the day missed, but that the day would still be deducted from their allotment of paid sickdays, and a written warning about “throwing a sickie” would be added to their file. Under the law where I am, a person earning a second warning within any 6 month period may be subject to imme 
That depends a lot on the situation. If it is an otherwise great employee, and I have not really gotten to know them other then that, I would likely just accept their word. If it. Was that employee yet again calling off on Friday, or their weekend to work, I would dscuss this with HR to figure out if anything can or should be done. If it is someone that I have a personal as well as a professional relationship with I might ask, “Is everything OK?” And they might call me at home one day if I was out from work to see if I am ok because we know and care about each other as friends outside of work  
I think that’s a very bad idea. Sick people cost the company money. They come in sick, which they seem to think makes them a good employee. But in fact, it spreads it to the other workers and magnifies the cost of their sick day by a factor of 4 or so. One day, a co-worker came in sick, and I had the next three days off. I told him, “one of us is going home.” And I meant it. “It’s either going to be you or me.” That was very awkward. He was very put off. But he left. I sent an email to my manager and his manager stating that the guy was deathly sick, and I asked him to leave in the interest of  
Accepting it is respectful about people’s privacy and treats them as adults. Never underestimate the morale benefits of treating your employees with respect. Yes, some people take sick days for reasons other than illness. Most companies limit the number of paid sick days that they offer, so this is a self-limiting problem. I’ve found that the kind of people who abuse the system in one way often abuse the system in other ways. If it’s a problem, you should already have policies to deal with that. I’m okay with the idea of an employee occasionally taking a mental health day. Sometimes it’s a good

I recommend to my small business clients that they have an integrated sick and vacation day program which accrues on a monthly basis, PTO, Paid Time Off. One of its numerous advantages is that employers and employees alike don’t need to parse the difference beteeen a sick day, a mental health day, a personal business day or a vacation day.

First day, accept it. Second day, be concerned. Third day, unless the disease is spreading through the public or workplace, ask if they’re seeing a doctor. As a parent, I learned to be honest with my bosses when I had to take a “sick kid day”, that I’m fine but the kid is sick. Statistically, there would be a chance I would be taking sick days later. On one occasion, I had to send pictures of my son’s infected injury because one day off for an emergency medical issue was understandable but asking for several days of working from home was seen as excessive.

Why is there doubt, why would you call calling in sick an excuse? Has that employee done this multiple times before and got caught ? If the answer is no, then believe the employee, period. You do NOT probe more, that can make anyone uncomfortable. Have you never felt bad waking up? Throat itchy, body ache, fever? It can happen to anyone. And when they get back to work, you ask them how they’re doing. It’s called being humane. If it doesn’t come naturally, then learn, no one’s perfect.

A lot of what you can and should do are dependent on your company policy. You need to adhere to that to protect your own job. In addition, the employee is under no obligation to provide more information. However, employers legally allowed to ask you what is wrong when you call in sick. If this is a small company without some type of policy, then get one. A little wrinkle is that some companies have personal time and sick time not only separate but allowed to be banked. If you let people bank up tons of “sick time” - don’t be shocked when they use it for a round of golf on a nice day. In the end, a 
I am a supervisor and how I handle these calls is to say ok, let me know if there’s anything I need to be aware of at work and is there anything I can do for you and hope they feel better soon. If someone is frequently calling out sick, I might have a meeting because I’m genuinely concerned about them and will see if maybe they need to reduce hours, adjust working times, perhaps their workload is too much and they were afraid to tell me. I’m not going to probe. I care very much about the people I supervise as individuals and needing to be out sick/take a mental health day should be encouraged. 
As a boss you have to deal with others excuses but it isn't your job to keep prying or you may get a gross description. Also there are sick days and vacation days. If they are in their limit or have no more time left you can talk to them face to face the next day. If he or she is a drag on your company you have the power. I once asked for further info and was told they had food poisoning then they described every detail. He had stuff coming out of both ends. The last time he went sitting down he passed bright red blood and I had to scream at him to go to the hospital. HaHa now you heard it too 
I would assume the employees reporting to me are mature adults and can gauge how well they feel sufficiently to know if they’re able to come in to work and perform their jobs. If a given employee shows themselves prone to abusing sick days, particularly if it’s a Monday, Friday or during a particularly difficult or high demand work period, I’ll begin to question their honesty and begin looking for a more detailed answer. An employee who consistently abuses sick days in this manner will invariably prove to be a poor employee, in my experience, and will eventually manage to get themselves termin 
Grammarly (product) SPAMs us with their Youtube and Quora Ads. They think our brains are too deficient to write decent sentences with the appropriate grammar. Please stop it ! You accept the excuse, and show your employee that you trust him. You want him to feel better when he comes. With to guilt, that would just screw his well-being.You first probe YOURSELF to know if you have not done anything that made him feel bad, stressed, anxious, to a point he would avoid coming back to work.You then check if there are any family problems he needs to deal with.79 views · View upvotes1Mark Kelcinski, I like to design printed material.

I would accept it. If they use one of their sick days, they are entitled to it and responsible for it. Who am I to tell anyone they HAVE TO do anything? Of course their could be consequences if they take undo advantage of their employment position. If they can’t or won’t do their job in the agreed upon timely fashion, they might have to be replaced for the sake of the business. Although I would personally extend all the compassion I could. It’s not always about good business, it’s about good people and their treatment. :-) 51 views · View upvotes1Mike SpeerUpdated 1 year ago · Author has 187 answers and 1.7M answer views
 This might be one of the most ridiculous questions I’ve seen. It’s simple. If they have a sick time/PTO, it’s all set. If they are a salaried employee without any PTO it’s just a day they wouldn’t be paid for. People need to stop focusing on the BS micromanagement. You don’t have to believe the employee and that is 100% ok, but there is nothing you can do. If it’s a habit or you see the employee missing key dates when things are due or their contribution to a project is due, you can address that in their yearly review. You’ll also remember this when it comes time to give out raises or bonuses. A 
I was the supervisor of a department of 5 people. Over time, I had actually hired each one of my workers and was very pleased with my choices. They were all mature, competent and responsible workers. If one phoned to tell me they were sick, I would believe that they were sick. And the rest of us certainly didn’t want to risk catching what they had! I guess it all comes down to whether you trust your employees or not. Certainly some workers try to “skive off” whenever they can, but, speaking as a hiring supervisor, I would have weeded those people out as quickly as possible. 104 views · View upvotes2Maddie Jones, studied Computer Science (2019)Answered February 24, 2021 · Author has 166 answers and 84.1K answer views
Today I took my first sick day ever since becoming a full-time employee. In the past, I've always tried to at least be at my desk even when I felt like absolute crap, getting very little work done. I've felt much worse before and still shown up to work. So why a sick day today? Because my concentration has been absolute crap lately. I've been getting very little work done during work hours. Combine that with bad sleep last night, and I knew I wasn't going to get anything done today. Now, I could still show up and sit at my desk for 8 hours, getting very little done. I could steal company time lik 
No. I don’t want to know. Usually I didn’t care to know the reason. All I cared about was that they were okay and how long they thought they may be out. We had policies in place for those who might rort the system and they usually purée themselves eventually and were performance managed out. Even with in-advance vacation and personal days, I didn’t need to know their plans. I just wanted to know when they’d be back. I found when I wasn’t micromanaging their time off, and respected them as adults who knew if they needed a day off, sick or otherwise - then I had a staff who rarely took time off. 260 views · View upvotes2Mani Shankar, former HR &amp; Administration at Private Sector; Public Sector.Answered 2 years ago · Author has 9K answers and 8M answer viewsOriginally Answered: If you are the boss and one of your employees calls in the morning and say that they didn't feel good when they woke up that morning so they're taking a sick day, would you accept that excuse or would you probe more for a detailed answer?
Today, the working environment is such that most of the employees are tied down by responsibilities that is not easy to be shirked with false excuses. So, when an employee calls and reports sick, best thing to do is to accept. Anyway, the employee is bound by the responsibilities and what he/she misses out on that day, will have to be completed the next day and the deadline met. If such absence is repeated, there are laid down procedures to shift such employees to unimportant positions or even asked to quit or sacked. Bosses have better things to do than keep probing each and every leave request 
I generally trusted that my employees, people of age and responsibility level to have jobs, had the judgement to know whether they were well enough to come to work or not. I only asked for more details on the second consecutive day, or if the absences were so frequent that policy required me to probe further by asking for a doctor's note or taking disciplinary action. I personally always give a reason on the rare occasions I call in sick. In accepting my job, I agreed to work as scheduled. If I can't, my employer at least deserves to understand why. 46 viewsRelated QuestionsI called in sick and didn't go to work. I just slept all day.

How can I find out who's stealing my lunch from the office fridge?
Going anon because certain people know who I am IRL and I don’t want them knowing my prank ideas. Not really an office one but when I was in university there was a girl called Gemma* in our flat who would use our food, drink, cooking utensils and cleaning products without telling us or replacing them. I was ok with this as Gemma usually did all the washing up for our flat so I thought ‘fair enough, she can use my crap’. I was the only guy in the flat however and the two other girls I lived with took exception to Gemma using their stuff. Gemma was Chinese so they put signs on all our cupboards  
Long time ago, in a city not far from here, I worked at a company that had a very good sneak thief. Lunches were only part of his repertoire. I'll get back to the food soon. His prowess was legendary and to catch him you had to think like him without being him. Difficult to say the least (to think like a thief but not be one).In his bag of tricks, he had a penchant for toilet paper! Yes, he just couldn't resist stealing toilet paper. First they would disappear from the rest rooms. When the owner caught on, there was only one roll IN said restroom but plenty more available. When he figured tha 
In the Australian mining industry we generally get our lunch meals supplied but have to assemble them ourselves due to the remote nature of the work (a casual 1500kms from home) so when someone with questionable morals is stealing your lunch it is that bit more ludicrous and amount more to “crimes of opportunity”. You also may be aware that all Australians are born holding a meat pie and it is an alternative currency “down under”  These are supplied in the mining mess hall to take for lunch albeit frozen. Upon arrival to work it is standard practice to put your pie in the “pie warmer” with your na 
Instead of asking “how can I find out who is stealing my lunch from the office fridge,” look at your situation from a different angle. I had this problem once NOT with someone stealing my lunch, but stealing my money to go buy a drink from the vending machine and I had to do without all day and I remembered that incident. I actually REPORTED the thief to the management and they KNEW who the culprit was, they even told me who it was, it was someone who was working inside the printing room and NOTHING was done about it. I tell you what, it NEVER happened again, I kept my money with me AT ALL TIM 
People here have suggested a secret additive such as hot pepper, spray paint, food dye, laxative, all not very food-like — possibly getting you in trouble with management or law. I have another one. Spilanthes. It’s more of a legitimate food. Go to a seed catalogue or ebay and order some seeds, grow the plant- it’s an easy one to grow, wait for the flowers- they're funny, pretty looking things- take a couple and crumble them up in your lunch. Not much flavor, and completely harmless- actually supposedly medicinal like a kidney cleanser or something- but they confer a disconcerting sensation of v 
This is my mother’s story (and she wants me to be anonymous in case of any potential issues) In a small doctor clinic, there was a food thief. Bits and pieces of lunches would be stolen from. Maybe a brownie, maybe a sandwich, maybe a snack, it was hard to predict what would be stolen from whose lunch. Over time, more and more would be taken. And the staff had been well-established for awhile with no new hires, making it hard to track down who was the thief. My mom and a few co-workers had enough of it. They decided to spice up their food. Nothing lethal like some other answers. Just sandwiches  
This is a spin-off to Keith Albert's (epic) answer to How can I find out who's stealing my lunch from the office fridge? In which Keith puts Carolina Reaper, the base for military-grade pepper spray, in an office sandwich destined for a five-finger discount. Years ago, I had a roommate who thought I was stealing his food. True confession: I did take an egg of his once. One egg. But I would have bought him two dozen in penance to avoid what happened next. He was pretty off his rocker in general and I was actually starting to wonder if he didn't have deeper mental issues. One day, I saw him baking 
Going Anonymous here half out shame for what I did and half out of concern that if he were too find out who did it to him he would hunt me down and kill me for sure. Don’t ever try this as it can go wrong oh so very wrong. My boss at the time was and probably still is a Grade a asshole who would steal anything and everything that wasn’t nailed down. Come to think about it, he would steal it even if it was nailed down, it would just take him a little longer. Now my coworkers and I where all starting to find parts of are lunch missing, sometime all of it. Come to find out it’s the office manager.  
I had this same problem. I am a nurse in an Emergency Room. My lunch was getting stolen on the regular. I wrote a note and placed it in my bag. “Whoever is stealing my lunch, please stop. I will catch you. This is a warning.” The culprit continued. It wasn’t every day. I noticed a pattern, if I brought PBJ sandwich, nothing happened. If I brought ham and cheese, it was definitely getting eaten. I tried making two, hoping to sacrifice one as an offering with a note, “I made one for you and one for me. Please leave me one.” The thief ate both and put the note in the sandwich bag. I was furious. Swo 
I just had to share this one. I didn’t get to see the shenanigans but I was told by a supervisor that watched the entire thing happen. There was a guy in our building that was a notorious food thief. We will call him “Jim” for simplicity sake. Jim did not care. He would eat any food that was in the fridge regardless of name, comment, or warning that was on the food. It was bad. It happened for a couple years with Jim and despite warnings and letters in his file he would not stop. (We work somewhere hard to get fired from unless you break the law most of the time) One day a co-worker of his snapp 
This question reminds me of a rather humorous story. Here’s my rendition of it! Josh’s lunch was getting stolen every day. Hungry during lunch time and frustrated, he used several approaches to convince the thief to stop stealing. He tried writing a note to the thief and appeal to his ethical side; The note read: “Dear thief, it’s morally wrong to steal someone’s food. Does your conscience not bother you? Your action has caused one of your colleagues to go hungry for the rest of the day!” The thief left a note with the reply: “My hunger trumps my conscience! Nice try, though! Bring a ham sandwich to 
I added a drug in my food which induced diarrhea and waited to catch the culprit. I was fed up with the lunch thief. Every other day someone would eat my lunch and this was a common phenomenon happening in our class. Any day a student bring something delicious it was bound to disappear. Some students stop bringing lunch others used to carry their lunch box wherever they go. Complaints were made to the school principal but, couldn't catch the thief. I suspected few students which included some senior students also but, didn't dare to say anything. Then I decided to do something extreme. I brought 
A friend of mine named Shawn worked on a hog farm with me years ago when we were both in our early twenties. This was a 4000 sow farm and had 16 employees (8 in the farrowing section and 8 in the breeding section) plus one manager. My friend and I both worked in the breeding department. Due to the large number of employees, the two departments always took lunch at different times. Shawn would always bring a two liter Pepsi to work every day to drink during lunch and breaks. He started noticing that some of his Pepsi would be missing at lunch nearly every day. Given that our department went to l 
While growing up I had this friend whose dad was a retired police officer. The dad always had this bottle of gin/vodka (whatever it was it was as clear as water, and my friend said it felt like fire) kept in a locker which he alone used. My friend and his younger brother felt they had become men and were entitled to doing men things, which included having a taste of whatever it was their dad was keeping in the locker. The initial efforts ended poorly as they just could not understand what their dad enjoyed in this drink that burnt their innards. They were men so they kept trying until they got  
I was wondering about that too when I started my job at Oldenburg University in 2006. The disappearance of butter was particularly annoying as I could store almost anything else – bread, marmalade, tea... – safely in my office. Instead of trying to detect the thief I eventually bought two lumps of butter and fixed two different notes on them: one read: "for me", the other "for you". The miraculous thing? My piece was left untouched and the unknown guest took only the piece I had dedicated for her or him. The thief could read – we were in a state of communication. I immediately replaced the miss 
 Back when I was thirteen, one of the businesses my father owned was a Delicatessen. My lunch would come from there, and it seemed that some students would keep trying to trade lunches with me, which I would not do. In all reality the school discouraged bringing your own lunch, and actually charged you for their provided lunch whether you ate it or not. The fact, was that the school lunch was so incredibly foul tasting, that it was hard to eat. From 1987–1988, there had been three salmonella outbreaks in the school cafeteria, one which the school would confirm, and I did not notice any change i 
The infamous Bologna Bandit. I like the answer that John Goodwin gave about the purple staining powder to identify the culprit. However, before you indulge your inner sociopath and lace your tuna sandwich with ghost peppers and laxatives, please hear me out. There was a sandwich thief at one of my old jobs. This Bologna Bandit would take several items out of peoples lunches in the work refrigerator; a real shopping expedition. It must have gone on for over a year until he was caught red handed, and it all made sense. Charles was an autistic man who also had moderate intellectual disability, and 
I agree with those that say don’t add anything to your food that could hurt another person. However, I do not agree with excusing people who are knowingly stealing food from others because they may be poor or hungry and are afraid to ask. That is BS. They could be stealing from someone who is also poor and does not have the money to replace their stolen lunches. There times in my life where money has been tight or non-existent and I did not use this as an excuse to steal from others. I worked at a place once where many of the employees were part-time and on some type of assistance to make ends  
WARNING; DISGUSTING Hey I warned you, but you have a lifeline. Don’t look. Don’t look. Don’t look. Don’t look. Don’t look. Don’t look. Don’t look. Okay lets go! Here we go: Although this takes place in a school, I have an idea. My mom used to make homemade nutella and pack it for my brother who would give me the leftovers. So it was tasty as frick! But I noticed my lunch was stolen one day, I let it slide, but it happened everyday for 2 MONTHS! I don’t get dinner so I was starving, and people thought I had anorexia. So I hatched a plan. I stole from the supermarket and ate a lot until I could do number 2 agai 
 Source: Dilbert for 8/12/2017 Ask your HR department or a member of management to write this letter (or legal equivalent) on company letterhead, which will then be posted at any place where food might be stored, and sent to all employees, of course. (Of course, one could create an artful forgery and post it anyway, just to get the point across.)

I suggest going into the Witness Protection Program.  There is a small clause in their code for victims of heinous lunch crimes. Now you will have to change your entire identity, move to a (most likely) less desirable town, get a minimum wage job, cut/dye your family's hair and live in a trailer, but at least you will get the joy in knowing you got the best of that sandwich stealing S.O.B.  They will then move on to some other unsuspecting victim and start reading havoc on their lives until they do the same as you.  Eventually, through process of elimination, the last person standing or the one 
This happened several years back at one of the first jobs I had after college. What was really strange is it was supposed to be a pretty professional workplace, but the lunch stealing was kind of the first sign that the company wasn’t that professionally run after all. That's why I've gone anonymous in here. Not looking to malign anyone, but understanding it was an office where there are sketchy things going on makes the story make more sense. A fairly new hire in the office was allergic to many food items: nuts, wheat, etc. So, he brought a lunch everyday. Many of us would eat out but he could 
This wasn’t an intentional ‘find out’ scenario, but it worked out beautifully. I love a bit of chili, and because I’m the primary cook in the household, my wife has built up a tolerance for it too. The problem in this case was that she’s not as aware of how high her tolerance is as I am; being the guy who puts it on her food. On this occasion, I made a chili beef pizza.. with a heap of nice toppings that included bits of brie cheese that form molten pools that mix with the chili sauce when cooked. It’s truly glorious, and looks and smells fantastic.. which works in favour for this story happenin 
How can I find out who's stealing my lunch from the office fridge? Heres a different spin on that story… A number of years ago this very thing happened to a workmate of mine. We had a reasonable amount of people on our floor and so there were about 30 people who had access (and likely used) the communal fridge in our kitchen. When my workmate’s (we will call him Bob) lunch mysteriously disappeared, he was a bit puzzled at first. After a couple of disappearances over several weeks it became apparent that a lunch thief was about. Bob resorted to doing what many people have already answered in this q 
I’ve experienced this. I used to have this Nestlé Cocoa powder in my desk in the office. I used to make a carefully measured chocolate drink with milk and keep it in the fridge so that I could enjoy it cold. Nice isn’t it? I used to go check for it a few hours later and there would be no drink. I used to get super pissed off and I had no clue who it was. It was irritating all that effort was going to waste. I even started drinking it as Hot cocoa in order to make sure it wasn’t stolen.  These are my options #Option 1 - Give em the runs Laxatives are a good choice. All you need to do is crush a pill 
I had a friend who is no longer with us named Bill… and he was a trickster in every sense of the word. He had this problem and how he dealt with it was epic and pretty much guaranteed no one would ever touch his lunches again. Two good examples of what he did to punish those who dared to touch his food. 1) One day he put what looked like a sausage on a bun in the fridge, which was as usual stolen from the fridge by a co-worker. turns out that wasn’t a sausage, but instead an old, rotten cigar. after being warmed up in the microwave, it was even more nasty and when the thief bit into is, the mel 
One day I came to visit my friend ‘T’, in his university share accommodation comprising 8 units with a common kitchen and lounge/dining area. ‘T’ was relaxing in the lounge, which was unusual for him, as he was normally focused on completing his Masters thesis in Physiology. 'T' was telling everyone what a rotten day he’d had after having to clean up a radiation leak at the lab. Luckily, there had been no contamination, he said seriously, but with a covert wink to me signalling mischief, so I said nothing. (In actual fact there was nothing at all radioactive in his lab). Like most of us, ‘T’ wa 
Easy! When I was in the Navy “A” school around 1999. I had four roommates. We shared the same room and took classes together. In the Navy, we got free food in the galley, so there really is no need to buy any extra food. But one of my roommates likes chocolate milkshakes and he would buy a couple of bottles and leave them in the fridge, in our room. He frequently complains that someone keeps drinking his milkshake and refilling the bottle with water. Everyone swore they did not touch his milkshake. One day we were both in the room, and he complained again. This time he wanted revenge. He bought a p 
There are some amazing answers here, but as has been pointed out by others or the authors, using poisons, medications and strong hot sauce, at least in the USA, can come with liabilities that can cost you your job, result in a lawsuit, or worse. The stealing of lunches falls under petty theft. Petty theft does not rise to the occasion of being legally handled through indirect bodily injury. In an attempt to find or punish your theft, you are likely committing a felony. Similar to why dog owners may need to put up a sign “Beware of Dog”, similarly you need to put up a warning. “Beware of Dog” is  
Well, this might not be a solution (well its been solved here though), but surely interesting metaphor to your question. Have a look and enjoy it, and do take care of your lunch box while looking at it. So it all started in and India company (details in the link provided as source). One of the employees got frustrated when every time her chocolates been stolen from the office refrigerator, so she decided to take it one on one (or may be one to many ;) ) and posted a printed note:  And then started a conversation between an unknown chocolate thief and the employee.  The suspense got intense, the thi 
I used to work for a large distribution center and we had the worst lunch thief. He would steal whatever to-go containers had the best food or if the bags said Texas Roadhouse. He would steal pizzas. I had too many of my lunches stolen. I bought a small buffalo chicken pizza and put a drop of visine on each piece of chicken. The acidity of the buffalo sauce hid any kind of smell or taste of the visine. Around lunchtime, I checked for my pizza and sure enough it was gone. A little while later my boss tells that there is a security guard in the bathroom. He says he can't stop, it's coming out bot 
While I agree that it would be risky to put anything in your food which would make someone sick - i.e. laxatives, poison, or known allergens (i.e. putting nut extracts in everything, knowing that one of your co-workers is allergic to nuts), this doesn't mean that you could make your food inedible.I agree that keeping your food in a cooler bag, at your desk or in your car, is the best thing, though placing a "tainted" lunch in the communal fridge could find the culprit.  For this I suggest...- a "booby trap" which would stain anyone opening the lunch; something like purple grape juice would b 
Here is how I approached the issue during the summer of 1971. I had a 40 Hr per week, 8 to 5 job, as a summer research assistant in Agricultural Engineering Dept. I also worked in evenings and on weekends as a airport lineman to pay for my flying. Each Monday at the start of my lunch break, I would walk to a corner grocery, near campus, and buy enough lunch meat, cheese and bread for the week’s lunches. I would walk back to campus, make then eat a sandwich and store the rest of my food in a department refrigerator. For my lunch breaks the rest of the week, I would make then eat a sandwich before 
Buy some Haribo sugar free gummy bears and put several handfuls in a small bag as your sweet treat.  There are some very poetic Amazon reviews attesting to their effectiveness:Amazon.com : Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears 5LB Bag : Gummy Candy : Grocery &amp; Gourmet Food The particular sugar alcohol they use can cause violent gastrointestinal distress if you eat more than a few bears at a time.  Some of the reviews indicate only a small handful of 10 or even less bears causing hours, if not days, of agony.  There are more than a few stories that involve the reviewer sobbing naked in a bathtub covere 
Several different things you can try. First, always make sure you label your food. 1.) Put mint oil in your food. Go ahead and just slap a ton of the stuff in there. If someone is allergic to mint… crap. But if they’re not, their tongue will literally start reacting funny and they’ll have troubles breathing naturally that are very obvious, not harmful. They might even make a comment about feeling numb, and they’ll talk funny. Entertaining, guaranteed, and almost completely harmless. (i.e allergies may ensue.. :c) 2.) Replace all of the food with tofu versions. 3.) If you drink soda, and THAT is g 
Forget what others are saying, I will tell you how to find out who steals your lunch and how to prevent it from happening ever again. Follow these steps: Buy a lunch or drink or whatever.Put your name on it, but very subtly so it can’t be seen.Put a shitload of laxatives in it. Like drench it in laxatives.Put it at your usual place and wait.You might have to wait for the thief. Remember, this may be just a game for him and he is trying to piss you off, but suddenly, the hunter has become the hunted. You are no longer prey, you are a weapon of destruction, your only purpose: Retribution. After a  
This is a guaranteed way for finding the criminal withing 3 days if they chose to keep stealing your lunch. Day 1. Add a note to your lunch box that says “ last chance, stop it or face consequences”. Day 2. If your lunch is missing on Day 1, then you need to See if you can get ahold of some paint bombs, the kind banks use to help catch robbers.  The dye pack used in over 75 percent of banks in the United States is called the "SecurityPac," made by ICI Security Systems. A regular dye pack consists of a stack of real bills (you don’t need the bills), usually of $10 or $20 denominations, with the dye 
I actually had a co-worker who’d help himself to food on other people’s desk. (He got a job at another company and quit a few years back.) I had a bag of cookies on my desk and was in a meeting most of the day. I got back from that meeting thinking I’ll have a cookie with a cup of tea but imagine my surprise to find the entire bag of cookies GONE! (To be honest, I only eat a couple from the bag anyway and mostly share with people around me. Everyone knows how I like to share snacks, but someone taking the entire bag was a shock.) Also, there was a time I was into carbonated water so I’d buy a  
The solution is simple: a huge dose of laxatives. Get the large tub of powdered laxative, and bring in a nice dish of spaghetti leftovers with it sprinkled on top with the parmesan cheese. Make a batch of brownies with chocolate flavored laxatives in it (about 20 to a box of mix) and leave the brownie(s), wrapped in cellophane, in the work fridge. On the day you bring in your decoy, go out to lunch somewhere else, so you aren’t tempted to dose yourself. You’ll easily discover the culprit once the food has gone missing by whoever is dashing off to the bathroom every 20 minutes. Once you’ve disc 
This isn't mine (unfortunately), but your question immediately made me think of this story I read a while back. Yes, it's devious, but it's probably a little safer than feeding your coworkers laxatives.  [sic] So I'm a bit of a chilli head. Love my hot sauces. I also love to cook. I also cook my wife a delicious lunch each day, She kept complaining that someone was stealing her lunch every couple of days out of the fridge at work. So I made her some buffalo wings for lunch to put in the fridge, They are really popular with her colleagues But I spiced them up just a little with some Blair's 4am R 
I used to have a theft problem at work. I would buy protein drinks in a 6 pack, and leave them in the fridge to have one each day for lunch. (The damn things were close to $2 each). I noticed a couple disappearing here and there, so I spoke to my coworkers. We are a small group, 3 of whom would not drink a protein shake for money, and 1 who wouldn't drink them because...gasp...They contained a little sugar. This left me with the only suspects, the cleaning crew, most of whom speak only Spanish. The last straw was one day when I put six in the fridge, drank one, and returned the next day to zero  
I made two batches of chococlate fudge brownies, one was normal and delicious, the other i melted in 6 large bars of chocolate laxitives, enough to make you sh!t yourself all day and night if you so much as ate a tiny bite of one brownie. I worked in a pharmaceutical production company making cancer curing drugs and someone would steal from my lunch box which was bagged and tagged in the fridge for my teams late night shift; they would steal from it every day, be it my banana, my lemon yoghurt, my donut, or even my bacon and egg with sausages meant for my dinner. I told no one about my plan sinc 
True story from a house I shared with four other women: I am an exceptional cook. I don't mean to brag, but compared to a lot of other 20-somethings at the time I made much better food. My specialty, however, was homemade chocolate pudding. At the time I had roommates. One of them was stealing my food, and I eventually figured out which one it was. I politely asked her to stop. Then I firmly told her to stop. Then we had a huge fight because she was still stealing my food! One day I made myself a pudding. Yes, the famous chocolate pudding I was so well known for. I put it in a clearly marked bowl 
I make a chop egg sandwich with these:   They are a Chinese delicacy in my language called “pine pattern eggs” because patterns formed under shells during the process of cooking/preserving. Peeled:  In shell:  The muddy looking outside is a mixture of calcium oxide, salt and, yes mud. Coat eggs with the mixture and keep in cool dark oxygen deprived environment, in human language a husk filled clay jar with lid. After some time, thirty days or so, nom-nom. The idea is the consistent low heat generated in “CaO+H2O=Ca(OH)2” cooks the egg. It is perfectly safe food. With that said, I have never had a ferme 
Let me help you with a trick which you can use to find out the answer of your question. Design a lunch box made up of 2 layers. In the 1st layer keep the lunch. In the 2nd layer keep the trick. Although it is a random idea, but still you can try it. Trick… Take the base of the lunch box and fix a thick cardboard sheet at it's base. Now use 2 strong springs and fix it on the cardboard layer. Take another cardboard and fix it over the given surface. Thus your spring trap is formed. Now keep a plastic rack over it and fill it with some colourful liquid. Thus, your trick is completely ready. Procedure of wor 
As I commented earlier, the Human Resources snare &amp; printer queue flank maneuver works like a charm. However, personal chocolate being held hostage raises the stakes considerably higher, and I feel I wouldn't be able to interpret the crisis as well if it had been, say, baby carrot sticks, broccoli, or those goddamned kale chips. With that said, the chocolate factor puts me in full reactionary mode…and, perhaps, my one shameful character flaw worse than my inability to adequately blow-up a sex doll in under 47 minutes…is my inability to let go of a chocolate grudge. Therefore, I would have done  
Once upon a time at a company I worked with, my co-workers invited me to come to lunch. I declined because as usual, I had brought a lunch. They kept pestering my so I said OK, I’ll put my lunch in the fridge and go. I went to my desk where I usually kept my brown paper lunch bag and lo and behold – it was missing!  At lunch, I mentioned this to my co-workers, wondering who could have taken my lunch? Immediately the whole group starts listing culprits. Within minutes they had it nailed to one individual and for the rest of the lunch they recounted all the times they suspected this person of s 
What should you say to a colleague if you see her wear the same shirt two work days in a row (Friday and Monday)?
There's a thing called a washing machine. It's this magical device that allows your dirty clothes to be thrown in along with some soap, and they come out clean in an hour! Then there's another thing called a dryer that you can throw your just cleaned clothes into, and they tumble around for an hour and get dry! Here's a little food for thought. There was a story following an Australian newscaster because he wanted proof that women's clothing is noticed more often then men's. This Australian newscaster decided to go a WHOLE YEAR wearing the SAME shirt and suit jacket to see how many people would not 
It's interesting to me how focused you are on this person’s clothing. I'm wondering if this is someone you like (like a crush), someone you want to humiliate or dislike in someway, (like a mean boss or co-worker), or if this is something you find yourself focused on in other settings. Even if she is wearing the same shirt two days in row, I also wonder what it is about someone doing this that feels very important to you. Do you find that you are generally focused on the appearances of others? Or perhaps focused on small details and feel the need to correct others around you? Was this something  
I work at a College, and we are occasionally given branded clothing. Now I have been working at the same place for 12 years, and I am still roughly the same weight. So I have by now a very nice collection of branded shirts and jackets, and quite a few of my shirts look exactly the same. I usually have a busy day at work, and I am on my feet a lot. The offices are generally old buildings - dusty and crowded, and full of places that can hook and tear or damage fancy clothing. Sometimes I even have to move heavy boxes and stuff. I also do not really work with the public - just my students and the st 
Another example of “Things women can’t do.”  Women are expected to wear “something different” every day (in jobs that do not require a specific uniform).  If they wear the same thing … they get judged.  They are either lazy, wearing dirty clothes, a “slut” (spent the night having sex, and so wore the same clothes the next day… aka walk of shame), or lacking in style. A man can wear the same suit every day of the week.  Same colors, same style, even the exact same suit … and no one notices or cares.  I dated a man who had five suits… all the same color and style, and 10 white shirts… exactly ali 
Has the overwhelmingly one-sided response to this question made an impact on you yet? There’s a simple reason why everyone has disagreed with your obvious opinion on this topic. Once you become an adult, and especially once you start working in the real world … that same sort of obnoxious middle-school behavior of not only judging another human being for stupid things like what they wear/how they look, but also of you feeling like you have some kind of “right” to go and tell them about it, TOOO?! ….. is just you being incredibly judgemental and just plain old RUDE!!!! Even if your coworker wears 
In addition to the things others said (there being two full days to do the laundry, the possibility of a strict dress code limiting options, the fact that people often buy more than one of something they really like, etc) I know I tend to wear certain items more often when I've gotten compliments on them, than items no one’s ever said anything about. If someone compliments the fit, color, or design of something I wear, I feel less self conscious, more confident, and better about myself when I wear it again. Compliments also mean that whatever item it was caught their eye. Especially in a cubic 
Absolutely nothing. First of all, its none of your business. Second of all, you do not know any details. When I lived in Europe, the Germans, French and Italians would buy only one or two outfits a year but they are expensive and of great quality. They buy for tailoring and quality, not quantity. The French do not buy fashion clothes but buy one or two pieces a year of high quality and then they accessorize with scarves, belts, or costume jewelry to give it fashion. I have worn black every day for over 25 years. When I like the fit and quality of a sweater, pants, or shirt, I buy 6 to 12 pieces 
You should say nothing. It’s completely irrelevant unless their actions are connected to poor hygiene which in turn has a direct negative impact on your work or their’s. For the past several years, I’ve been wearing essentially the same outfit to work almost every day. It’s a self imposed uniform of sorts. I manage a warehouse where I have to be prepared for both getting occasionally dirty or sweaty, but also have to be dressed appropriately enough to speak with clients who may show up unannounced. I’m not willing to spend the money required to constantly replace my fine clothing that may get d 
I have an interesting perspective on this. I’m from the US and i never wore the same outfit twice. I had 30 pairs of shoes and two over flowing closets of clothes. When i moved to france i donated almost everything, and kept my favorite items and a nice classy wardrobe for work. 6 months after i realized i STILL owned too much and purged again. I now have 4 pairs of shoes and a classy, chic capsule wardrobe. i even asked my friends why they rewore the same clothes all the time 1. because it is not dirty. I sit at work, i go home. Why would i waste energy and water cleaning something that isn’t  
Original Question: What should you say to a colleague if you see her wear the same shirt two work days in a row (Friday and Monday)? My Answer: First of all, you have zero business in saying ANYTHING to her about what she wears to work. It's none of your business, so do her a favour and say not one damn word about this. This may come as a surprise to you, but not everyone can afford a different outfit for every day of the week. I certainly couldn't when I was still able to work in my office job. 14 years later, I'm 47 and still can't afford many clothes and I never shop at boutiques. I go years wi 
This is the EASIEST question to answer… N-O-T-H-I-N-G!!! You don't say anything! Why would you? What do you care, honestly? This RIDICULOUS idea, that everyone needs to have a different outfit, for every day of the week, or the even more ludicrous, a different outfit for every day of the month, is absurd! For one, not everybody can afford that many different work outfits, of even non-work outfits. Honestly, it's almost more ridiculous that someone rotate the same clothes each week, or month… Does anyone else really care that you wear the same outfit every Monday, or the same outfit every 30 days? 
A few years ago, my brothers and I were playing outside with one of our neighbors. We were frolicking and playing and enjoying ourselves when, all of a sudden, the mood made a total about-face: “Why do you guys always wear the same clothes?” my neighbor inquired. I had always known she was right, but I was stunned and taken aback by the fact that she not only made these observations over the years but had the impulse to say something about it. In hindsight, I can tell that she was not trying to come off as rude or snobby. Unfortunately, however, my young brain got defensive when it happened, and I 
True story. I cannot wear something once I have already worn it. Like even when I come home in evenings, for those last few hours lazing watching tv, whatever I wear is fresh out of the drawers/airer. If I've worn it even for only a couple of hours, it gets washed. Yeah. My laundry is a permanent cycle but it's just a hang up I have. However. If I like the item, I will buy multiples. If you see me in the gym, unless there is a laundry snafu, I will be wearing the exact same t-shirt and trousers. Every single day…..I have 4 of the exact same set. I even had to track down the last few copies of my 
Everybody has their own perceptions and thoughts but I find this idea very mysterious and interesting. If somebody is wearing the same shirt twice there isn’t any wrong in this until and unless the dress is unclean or dripping with sweat. However you cannot judge that person just because of his dressing and why is it bothering you when you have other stuff to perform at work. There could be a lot of reasons if a person wears same shirt twice in a row. May be he feels more comfortable in that dressMay be he has two shirts of the same colorThere could be a possibility that the person is from some 
Absolutely nothing. You are a freeloader. The fact you are wasting company time observing such habits does not reflect well on you. Do you not have enough work to do? If so, ask your manager for more work to keep you productive! Many folks that work within an office setting can get away with wearing a dress shirt more than once without washing. With easy care fabric, this is common. My daily attire included khaki pants each day with a variety of shirts. Now that I am retired, my daily attire is jeans and a polo shirt - I wear the jeans many times before washing. You don’t see anyone making any s 
I remember watching a collegue (lets call her Jayne) humiliate herself when gossiping about another collegue and the fact that this woman always wore the same dress to work for a week &amp; the next week she would wear a second dress all week long. So why was the collegue Jayne, who was doing the gossiping, feeling humiliated? Because after all that gossiping and laughing about it, it turns out her collegue was autistic and liked order. She had 7 dresses in one style and seven dresses in another. She would wear one style a week! Dont be so quick to judge! Jayne made herself look like a total bitch t 
Welcome to our First Episode of Human Behavior Analysis (Other wise known as HBA) with Richard Today’s Questions is What should you say to a colleague if you see her wear the same shirt two work days in a row (Friday and Monday)? The Answer is Nothing Let me tell you why  See that? Look again  The green indicates the days she wears shirt A, the red indicates the days between Day 1 and Day 2 So instead of it going Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday etc. It actually goes Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday etc. So between your two indicated days th 
You asked about Friday and Monday. If you wear the same shirt on Friday and then its consecutive Monday, no body will remember it. Even if you wear the same shirt for 2 consecutive days, no body will gives you a shit, until or unless s/he having an eye on you. Many times it happens people wear same clothes, its not because they are lazy or don’t able to choose in morning or the other options are not good (in my case not ironed or dirty enough to wear again), sometime they have to travel to different places or they have slept somewhere else other then home ( not one night stand) or they are nailin

Um… Nothing. First: Friday and Monday aren’t “in a row” there are 3 days between them on one side of the week and 4 on the other. Second: I usually wash my clothing over the weekend. And wear the same 6 outfits every week. Sometimes I wash them during the week and wear them again (think Monday and Wednesday). There’s nothing wrong with this and the fact that you feel like you have to say something to them about it shows that your priorities are in the wrong place. Also, think about it this way, I don’t have the opportunity to buy new clothes often because my money gets spent on other items. Beca 
When I find an article of clothing I like, I buy several of it, and I wear it a lot. This does not mean I wear the same actual piece of clothing several days in a row, it means I wear identical pieces of clothing several days in a row. Or I switch, A B A B A B. Barack Obama famously had multiples of two suits, the brown and the blue, and used this same plan. He said he had read studies indicating that you really only have so much decision making power in a given day, and that by eliminating the necessity to plan an outfit, he was just a little more able to make actual important decisions. I don’ 
Absolutely nothing. It’s not only none of your business, you could be being culturally insensitive or just displaying your own lack of information or an exaggrated sense of entitlement. Do you know it’s the same shirt, or is it just one of multiple identical ones? Designer Michael Kors wears the exact same every day - it’s all black and he never has to spend time on thinking about what to wear. Did someone write a (rather preposterous) rule when I wasn’t looking that requires one to change clean clothes everyday? The answer is no… that’s a rather American thing, and then only some Americans. E 
Nothing. I don’t think you are part of the “clothing police” and unless you are the person’s mgmt and the person is coming to work stinking from BO and dirty clothing; it’s none of you business. The latter actually happened to an assistant mgr of mine back when I was in college. She was fresh out of college and had to talk to an employee about her smelling bad and other co-workers complaining about her. I think this individual lived in a trailer park, back in the 1980’s, and didn’t have ready access to water for some reason. Anyways, unless you are in that position of authority, the situation i 
You are not of my generation but I’ll tell you anyway. Years ago people didn’t have much money and if you went to a Catholic school you had to wear uniforms. It’s the same way now except some public schools have adopted the uniform concept too. If you were poor or had too many brothers or sisters when you got home from school your mother would wash all the shirts and blouses, dry them in the kitchen or cellar and iron them in the morning for you to wear again. The jumper or pants would be washed once a week if you didn’t get them dirty. Your mother ( or you ) might press off the jumper, skirt  
Why would you want to say anything? Are you the fashion police? Well, here’s news to you: Unless that shirt stinks, she probably washed it over the weekend. And unless your colleague has very poor personal hygiene (in other words: Stinks up the whole office with her BO to a degree that makes it hard to breathe), you should not say anything save perhaps to compliment her on her good taste. That said, many years ago I did have a coworker with exceptionally bad personal hygiene. He did not only wear the same shirt to work twice, he wore the very same outfit all week, every week: Brown slacks, light 
When I was eight or so I accidentally overheard a group of people making plans to strip another man. The reason being he wears the same shirt and pants every day. Getting stripped would embarrass him; he's definitely going to change, they affirmed. I remember the chills I got down my spine that moment. I didn't know what to do, but I definitely knew I should do something. I ran to that man who they were talking about and stood in front of him. Eight year old me couldn't repeat those words. I knew it'd hurt him deeply. So I started crying. Because I felt helpless. In between the sobs I said words  
I once sat next to a guy, at work, who always wore the same shirt and pants. People teased him. I became a friend of his at work and he asked me if he should just come out and tell the other workers that he was not good at picking out clothes, so he would buy 4 or 5 sets of the same thing. I said sure or I will mention it to them. He said that would be very nice of me. A few days later he was not at work and I mentioned the clothing thing to the 'group'. They understood. Matter of fact, one other guy said he always takes his sister out with him to buy his clothes because he just doesn't know h 
If she smells bad and it's affecting the work environment please say something but tread lightly. You don't know the reason behind. I buy ten of everything for my everyday wardrobe. Ten panties, ten pants, ten shirts and everything I need all in the same colour. Why? Because I hate mornings and I don't want to deal with picking out matching clothes before going to work. This way I just grab what I need to get dressed and ready in all clean clothes for the day. It saves time and eliminates wasting energy on making decisions in the morning. I get ten in case I can't do laundry one weekend or I nee 
Wow this question has gotten so many answers that I think the person who asked would never forget. Anyway - chances are that you might be annoyed with her shirt, might not like it or believe that it doesn’t suit her. But even if this was the case, you still cant say anything to her even if it is in a friendly tone. Some people are so busy with life and life chores that they don’t have time to go out and about for shopping or they don’t find shopping as a favorite thing to do. I myself - after reading why mark zuckerberg wore the same shirt every day found out that his reason was that this was a tr 
 Source : Steve Jobs Always Dressed Exactly the Same. Here's Who Else Does If you know this person closely I suggest you ask them privately if everything is okay (do this only if they show any signs of distress) otherwise you should keep your mouth tightly shut. There could be a huge number of reasons why someone was wearing the same Shirt two days in a row. They may be going through a hard financial timeSomeone had an accident or someone is so sick that trivial things like changing clothes does not even matterThey are so engrossed in their life and generally being great that trivial things like f
I had 3 pairs of brown trousers. I once wore each pair of trousers for a week. It got noticed by a lot of teachers and students. People started to say that I smell and other random stuff. Only one teacher really understood and told me to not wear the same kind of outfits for more than a day because people are shallow and unable to comprehend that. Your average Joe is simple-minded. (It’s not an insult, but the average Joe will feel insulted) As it’s not possible to get around it, the sole solution was to follow that advice. It can be worse because of “blindness to change”. If you wear a specific ite 
I don’t see what’s wrong with wearing a shirt two days in a row? Though the ‘Friday and Monday’ are not two days in a row, dummy. But even if someone did wear a shirt two days in a row, why is that a bad thing? The only bad thing is if someone stinks. Wearing new shirt every day doesn’t guarantee that the person wouldn’t stink. I often wear a shirt two days in a row. I hate ironing the clothes. And besides, its as clean as the first day because it’s not like we are gonna go to office and wrestle on the ground, right? Good thing you don’t work in the Military or factories etc. where people have to 
 You should say: “Good morning! How was your weekend? Did you do anything fun? Have your heard the news about_____?” (Fill in the blank with the latest weather news - or the news about your local Girl Scouts - or literally any benign topic). Telling your colleague that she’s wearing the same thing she wore on Friday is a bad idea for the following reasons: #1 - It’s none of your business what she’s wearing. How would you react if your co-workers criticized what you’re wearing? #2 - You don’t know the circumstances. Maybe she was away from home for the weekend and was unable to change her clothes.  
Well, obviously, even before this happened, way, way before, I would institute an office policy of “managed dress code”. Whereby I would have everyone line up when they arrive at the office for a quick photo of their outfit, which would be digitally posted to the office dress-code website which is obviously broadcast on the web kiosks we have in the kitchen, meeting areas, and entrance lobby. And over the cubicle farm. And is the default home page for corporate-provided laptops. Then I’d make it clear that the managed dress code means one cannot wear the same article of clothing — any article,  
If that colleague does not have a personal hygiene problem then there is no reason to be aware of what they are wearing or how it might effect you. There may be a good reason. They may feel that it isn’t right to pollute your water supply further than it is with detergents. They may wish to preserve water because there are some in the world that do not have fresh water to drink let alone wash their clothes. They may have decided that no one will notice as they have busy weekend lives and will have forgotten Friday by the time Monday has come around. At least if they had a life outside work the 
Nothing. What your colleague is wearing is absolutely none of your concern. She might have done laundry over the weekend. She might have two identical shirts (some people buy items they like in multiple copies). She might just be wearing that shirt without washing it because, depending on the fabric and level of activity, there’s no actual need to wash your clothes each time you wear them. And even if you find yourself with the actual need to say something to her, make sure you address her in a kind and respectful manner. Even if she resents your nosy behavior, which she would be perfectly entitl 
I’m going to read something into this question that isn’t explicit in the words, and address it. Suppose you suspect that this person wore the same shirt to work two days in a row because she (gender was mentioned, let’s pretend it’s important) didn’t go home. Maybe you’re thinking, “Walk of shame. So awkward. What should I say?” Because it’s not about the clothes at all, is it? No. It’s actually about your fantasies about this woman, and what she’s been doing. Hypothetically. Suppose, hypothetically, that this is what you’re thinking. You say nothing. For four very good reasons: It’s none of your b
Why do you feel the need to say something at all? If it’s obvious she isn’t bathing and washing her clothes and it’s a health concern then it would depend on how well you knew her and your relationship with her. If you actually do things together, then maybe, you could say something in the spirit of friendship. If you are only work colleagues (which, since that is your choice of words I’m going to take at face value), then you can go to your supervisor/manager and ask them to address it. Most of all though, you don’t need to say a word about it!! First off, in your case, you say it was over a F 
Apparently some people think it’s their business what other people wear. It’s stupid. Don’t be one of them. Read the two articles linked below to see how stupid it is. The Daily Mail (UK newspaper) “outed” a TV presenter for repeating the same outfit four months later. The big irony is that three years earlier her co-presenter wore the same suit for a year and no one noticed.

If it is just a colleague - you don’t really need so say anything. If you can’t get hold of your curiosity i.e. you can’t resist to know why the same shirt has been worn over the weekend. You don’t directly go and speak to the person about the shirt. You need to understand the psychology of the person. Does the person really care about what shirt he wears? Does the person care about what other people think about him/her? So to know about all of these aspects you know make some effort to know the person first. Is the person lazy, dirty, does he not care about grooming and other? Is he so full i 
It is amazing how many answers here go out of their way to angrily suggest all sorts of scenarios but the most plausible one, the one that the question is so obviously hinting at: this woman so obviously never went home on Friday, most likely spending the weekend with her lover and going straight back to work without the time (or the desire) to go home for a change of clothes. She most likely washed her shirt at her lover’s place. All this means that she had a most memorable and enjoyable weekend. Yes, I saw all other arguments, comparing women to Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and TV news anchors 
Maybe your colleague does laundry on the weekend and doesn’t keep track of what she wears or wore last to avoid wearing something twice in a row. Was it dirty? Does she look distressed? Has she left an abusive situation with the clothes on her back and needs help? Did her house burn down? Did she go away for the weekend and forget to pack a different work outfit for Monday? If you think she needs help and you’re willing to help, say something generic like, “If you need anything you know you can let me know, right?” There are so many possibilities. You really don’t have enough information to do much m 
Seriously? My grandmother and all the people of her generation did the wash once per week. It was by hand. So my grandfather (an engineer and later state health inspector), like most professional men of his generation, wore the same shirt every day for a given week. It was unreasonable for a women (and yes, it was always women) to wash seven pants and shirts for their husband and children each week. So in human history, this obsession with changing clothes so often is very new. In most times and places, people have not been close to wealthy enough to do this. Personally, if clothes are clean and 
Er who cares? Surely there are more important things to worry about in life than if someone wore the same outfit two days in a row. Even if they were literally two days in a row. Perhaps she got laid last night and hasn't been home to change yet. If so, grin and high five her for getting her groove on. Good for her! Be happy for her. If I ever see someone I assume to be doing the “walk of shame”, I grin to myself. I grin to myself because in her shoes I'd still be on cloud 9 and I'm hoping that's how she feels. I pretend not to notice, but in my head I'm high fiving her and saying “Yeah you did 
First off, it’s none of my business or anyone else's business. Why would you need to say anything? I happen to like traditional German trockten shirts. I order them from a store in Munich. The cut and details are unlike anything I could buy in the USA. (Perhaps at a German store that sells leiderhosen, and other German goods, but the mark up would be 3 times what I pay for the shirts I order.) The shirts are always gingham and most of the shirts are a red and white or blue and white. A solid silk tie in red or blue always looks great. There are days when I may weat blue everyday for a week or r 
Nothing. Not everyone can afford 5 work shirts or more and the fact that it was worn 2 days in a row means nothing. 1. Given the question, I’m going to assume that uniforms aren’t provided and that you work in an air-conditioned, likely sit-down, environment. Thus, the shirt, most likely, is still clean the next day. 2. I know it’s hard for some people to comprehend; but, you can wash a shirt that same night—even if you have to do it by hand—and wear it the next day. 3. You referenced Friday and Monday—which means that there are 2 whole days in between, in which this person can wash her laundry. 4 
You should say Good Morning, and how are you? Did you have a nice weekend? Assumptions are not dependable. You are making an assumption that she doesn’t own two of the same shirt. You are making an assumption that she should NOT repeat clothes. You are making an assumption that one should call attention about this to the person. You are making an assumption that the reason she might be repeating clothes is something she needs to share with you. No. No. No. What she wears has nothing to do with you. People can repeat clothes as often as they want in the workplace. There are minimalists who live wi 
Nothing at all. I’m in the military and that's normal. You expect someone to switch to a clean uniform every few days or so, mostly, barring particularly dirty work. In boot camp, the first two weeks, before we were issued our working uniforms, we wore the same sweats every day (which of course prevented doing laundry.) 80 people in a dirty boot camp environment,required not to change clothes for two weeks. It was highly unpleasant, but no one died, and after going through that, you kind of get the sense that if you are changing clothes often enough to never ever ever feel like you did for those  
You say, “How was your weekend?” I am curious as to why your colleague’s daily choice of garments would be of such uncommon interest to you that you feel compelled to have to say something to her about it, to the point of going to Quora to ask what you should say. Unless of course your particular job function, for which you actually had to obtain considerable training and security clearance, is to monitor the clothing choices of your colleagues, whose job performance hinges on the wearing of totally random, visibly different clothing every single day. But I am betting you are just nosy. By the w 
What should you say to a colleague if you see her wear the same shirt two work days in a row (Friday and Monday)? If your criticism is about fashion choice, absolutely nothing. Other people’s taste in clothes is none of your business. If your criticism is about hygiene, still absolutely nothing but for different reasons. Firstly she could have washed the shirt on the weekend. Secondly she could have more than one identical shirt. I personally own 6 one hundred percent identical black sweaters. I own 5 one hundred percent identical black jeans. I own about 5 one hundred percent identical black shi 
I remember working this sales/ telemarketing gig that sucked and the pay sucked. And it was a man who wore the same thing every day Monday through Friday. He didn't stink or anything,he didn't seem weird just he wore the same thing. One day one of my friends had a conversation with him. Coming to find out he and his wife were trying to go to school to be a doctor's and they were very frugal and one of the sacrifices for him was to wear the same thing , I'm assuming he didn't buy anything new unless it was absolutely necessary he knew what he really needed the money for and his goals. So why ca 
Absolutely nothing. I have been in the office/corporate environment for many years now and do you know what is the one thing I could do without every morning? Having to decide what to wear. Many men wear the same outfit repeatedly. We simply don’t notice it (or are less judgmental about it). There is an unfair assumption that women must wear a different outfit every day (and try not to repeat it on a weekly basis), otherwise, people would think she either does not have sufficient office outfits or have questionable personal hygiene. That is NOT true. Some of us (women) have gone the route of est 
“That shirt looks nice on you.”Unless the person does not smell good or it seems evidence of something that might be going poorly with her, it does not matter what someone wears. In that case, a kind personal conversation or a word to her manager could be helpful in checking on her well-being. When I was younger, my parents did not see clothes as a priority, so I had a limited wardrobe. I also LOVED a certain outfit and would try to space it so that I could wear it twice, on either end of the week. A group of kids made fun of my on the school bus, and I don’t think I ever have forgotten that t 
I would say You should mind your own Business and not say anything. Perhaps think about real issues. Im a 42 year old and i rarely change my clothes. I dont care about impressing people with my wardrobe collection. Dont like shopping either. I may have felt that was an issue in grade school and i was poor but kids are still developing and dont know much. That sort of thinking alienates people who may not have the resources Or comfort level to dress like all the other cattle. Also married for 15 years to a super hot lady, decent social skills, friends, money, etc. I put on one of few things i l 
I won't care what you say. If anyone comments, I usually nod and say, “I like my money.” I treat anyone else with similar dressing choices the same, regardless of gender, because shopping for clothes is a time and cash sink. I'm one of those guys who have 5 of the same polo shirt, 5 of the same dress shirt, and six of the same work pants, and two of the same blazer in different colors. I wear them because being the same sets an expectation of stability. I'm always the same, every day. Yes, I've been told as much, and that is one reason why I do it. I’m to be judged on my performance, not on my w 
The question made me smile remembering my experience with the same shirt thing. I was a mid level manager in a plant setting. As part of my function I spent quite a bit of time dealing with Union Stewards and resolving Labour Relations issues. One of the Job Stewards seemed to be wearing the same shirt all the time. Finally, I mentioned to him that he might want to change his shirt we were all kind of tired of it. It had become his trademark. It turned out he was a bit insulted that we thought it was any of our business. It seems he bought about 15 identical shirts at an auction to use as work  
Why say anything? It’s her business and hers only why she’s wearing it, whether she has washed it, or it just looks clean. I go on a lot of business trips around the world, and I prefer to travel light. I’ve seen my colleagues wear the same thing two days in a row, like Tuesday and Wednesday, I’ve done this too, I’ve switched two or three outfits on ten day trips, and I never reported to anyone, and I never asked anyone why they wear what they’re wearing. It’s rude. Another case is when you see someone wear something that looks dirty or/and old, and doesn’t fit the scene, is smelly, and such.  
Why on Earth does that matter?! I have 3 of the same black turtle neck shirts. I work in a law firm and its winter time and I’ve worn “ the same shirt” (the black turtle neck) for the past 2 days. No one has noticed and if they did who cares. I shower everyday, make sure I’m clean and my clothes are clean so no one is getting hurt. I also look professional, make it to work on time, and do my job. I would be shocked and ridiculously annoyed if any of my coworkers came up to me and pointed out that I’ve already worn this shirt even though it is clean and it is not impeading their work. I was not

What should you say to a colleague if you see her wear the same shirt two work days in a row (Friday and Monday)? I don’t know but I am lucky I don’t work with you or you would be asking what to say to a colleague that wears the same shirt seven days in a row, the same pants two or three weeks in a row and has just one single pair of shoes. Why are you so interested in her oufits? Clothes are just fabrics to keep us warm and cover our nakedness in societies where going al fresco is not customary. Leave her alone and change your underwear regularly. Don’t be like me, wearing the same for three day 
Just say “nice shirt!”. Say it with honesty in your voice and eyes and move on. The reasons she could be wearing the same shirt again? Many, but who cares? And why should anyone care about it anyway? I remember a colleague once said that he has five shirts, four for workdays and one extra. We had casual Fridays when he flaunted his T-shirt collection. Honestly, anything he wore was flaunted given the six-feet-tall-white-chocolate-demigod he was! Coming back to the point, we never got distracted by his repeatition of shirts. Easy for boys you say? Taking a leaf out of his book, and catching up wi 
I can think of several things: “ I love your blouse! or I’d like to have a blouse like that, where did you get it?” You get the idea. Think about it - there is absolutely no reason to expect someone to wear something only 1 day a week or even two. If it doesn’t smell, why in the world do you care? You have no idea what may or may not be happening in her life. Maybe she’s like I am and just wears something until it reaches a point when it needs to be washed (spills, odor, washing that color, etc.).Maybe she had no money to go to the laundromat and had nothing else to wear.Maybe her kids were sick
Goodness, I've worn the same skirt four days in a row. If anyone noticed (which I doubt), it's not really had any effect on my career prospects. I've also worn the same shirt two days in a row without washing it (!) and somehow I'm still alive and employed. I've also never notice colleagues wearing the same clothes several days in a row and even if I did, I wouldn't care. (It's not generally necessary to wash clothes after one wearing. Underwear is the one exception. But a shirt or a skirt that I've worn a cami and tights underneath? Gods no! I don't want to waste water unnecessarily plus too fre 
Nothing. If it was Friday and Monday then they had the weekend between to launder the shirt. Maybe they like the style, cut or color or comfort of it and they’ll wear it often sometimes more than once in a week if they’ve washed clothes in between or are a very clean person and the clothing is still in good and clean shape. I recently lost weight after 20 years of being overweight at the same size. So now I only own a small amount of clothing myself. I’m a mom, I spend all my money on my kids and hubby so I have exactly 3 pairs of shoes. And right now my co-workers have probably figured out tha 
I feel like I am missing something. Is there a rule that you can’t wear the same item of clothing for more than a day? I frequently wear the same shirt, the same trousers 2 or 3 days a week between washing them. If there aren’t any circumstances like excessive sweating, or dirt or anything that might pose a hazard to your clothing, why would you waste time and money washing it when it is perfectly ok to wear that item a second or a third day. Occasionally if it’s not actually dirty and I am travelling, I’ll have 2, maybe 3 shirts (that all look the same, because once I find one I like I just buy 
Do her a favour and never talk to her. You’re too shallow. I sometimes wear the same shirt 3 or 4 days, maybe even the whole work week. If it’s dirty or stinks I don’t wear it. Unless I accidentally grab it when I get dressed in the dark. Then I have a dirty shirt for a day - whoopty-freaking-doo. Nobody get’s sick over it. Worst case scenario is a bit of smell wafts your way, and I’m a bit embarrassed for a day. Meanwhile I’m choking on your perfume. Maybe you sweat profusely and wearing the same shirt is a problem because it will stink. Or maybe you’re a messy eater. Or maybe you have an unh 
I wear nearly the same thing every day; a black short sleeve, v-neck tee-shirt and slim or skinny fit blue jeans. I usually pair that with black boots in the winter or black sneakers in the summer. I joke that I’m like a cartoon character. You always see me in the same cloths. I’ve got about 30 tee-shirts and about 10 pairs of jeans. All basically identical. That isn’t the only cloths I have - I have some suits, some graphic tee’s, a few other things, some green for St. Patrick’s Day shows, and of course my Steam Punk costumes for conventions and gigs. But without a reason to not wear my uniform, 
I do go to work wearing the same shirt on two consecutive days (like Monday &amp; Tuesday). Oh, wait. I have two identical shirts, one that I bought myself and one that I received as a gift. Sometimes, appearances can deceive. Also, like most others said, Friday &amp; Monday are not consecutive and there’s plenty of time to wash that shirt in between. Or, if I work the morning shift, I can throw the shirt in the washer after I get home at noon, have it dry over the afternoon and night (especially in summer), iron it in the morning before leaving for work and wear the same (clean) shirt the next consecuti 
As a teacher, what is the saddest experience you've had while on the job?
I was new to the school as a 9th grade English teacher, and it was already one of the worst jobs I had ever had. The school had a pretty poor reputation among all the schools in the county, but I had thought--how bad can it really be? As usual, there were bright spots. Much to my surprise and great good luck, some of my students did not buy into the bad behavior that seemed so prevalent. There were also new students coming in all the time as it was a fast growing area. Many of those new students--for whatever reason--kept their sweet natures. It was obvious that the worst, most belligerent stud 
Unfortunately, there have been far too many in my 35 years with the school system, but this one sticks out in my mind. I was a second year teacher then with a great group of first grade kids. To put this situation in perspective, I’d come off a rather painful first year of teaching 7th graders in a challenging side of town, nearly quit mid way through, and then at the end of the year due to budget cuts all 1st &amp; 2nd year teachers were laid off. Despite being jobless it was a huge relief to know there was no way I was coming back to that school. The district ended up hiring us all back if we wa 
Soon after graduating from the university, I started working as a lecturer in physics. One of the students in my class, aged 17–18, used be absent from the class on frequent basis. Not only this, he would never participate in the class activities; he never asked questions nor answered or tried to answer those asked by me as a teacher. During the lecture, he would just stare blankly at the board as if he had no interest in learning anything at all. In the rare conversations I had with him, his replies would be very brief and somewhat impolite. Whenever I asked him about the reason of his absenc 
I had an 8th hour Public Speaking class of 30 kids. They were great kids and we had a wonderful time sharing our ideas and interests with each other. Our school also participates in a dual credit program with a community college in our city. The community college provided practical job training - kids could spend half the day there learning criminal justice, nursing, culinary arts, mechanics, and several other types of skills. It is a highly popular program to this day and is invaluable to our students who don’t wish to pursue college. Students would drive to the community college in the morning 
Listening to the sobs of a very dear student, wishing I knew what to say or how to fix things. She moved to our town to live with her dad and his girlfriend, leaving home because her mother did not approve of her boyfriend. Her mother was a professional, a school administrator of some kind, and this individual a very capable young lady. It was hard to imagine that things would have gotten so bad at home that she had to move hours away into her dad’s trailer, paying rent as a high school student, yet here she was. It seemed like a big mistake, but she was such a bright kid, you had to give her t 
I had a 22 year old student with a high school diploma struggling in my class. I stayed after every day to offer tutoring for my students. He walks in and notices he is the only one there, asks me if he can close the door to talk to me privately. He closed the door walked to my desk with his head down, looked up at me with tears in his eyes and told me he couldn’t read. I’m dumbfounded, he graduated from high school and can’t read? He was a gifted football player, was passed in his classes so he could play. No worries for his future just a winning ball team. I decided we would start with the very  
I’ve heard some pretty sad stories. Sometimes we have no idea what home life is like for kids. I didn’t teach this kid, my friend did. She said she noticed that although he was coming to school regularly, he started to stink. His clothing was mildewed, dirty, and wrinkled. He was not attentive and sometimes slept in class. When he was finally pulled in to the counselors’ office to find out what was going on, it took a while for him to crack. He didn’t want to admit anything. After a while, he finally told them that about a month and a half prior, his mom had run off with her new boyfriend. She d 
Although this took place in my classroom, it had nothing to do with academics. A 13-year-old was despondent and lethargic in class. He had not been so all year. At the end of class one day, he asked to stay and talk. I had a planning period, so I said “sure.” With tears in his eyes, he told me that his dad had a terminal illness and that he was acting as caregiver when he got home from school. His mom had moved on to someone else, so this child had taken on the roles of housekeeper, caregiver, trash remover, etc. He was worried he was not doing a good job and that his dad would suffer because of 
I ran a Montessori school. One of my children was a 5 year old girl who had an identical twin. Her parents had divorced and not only separated the twins, but moved to different states where they had minimal contact. This bright kind little girl, who lived with her father, was very depressed, though she didn’t speak of her sorrow. I took her aside and told her that I could see that she was terribly sad and that when she was too sad to bear it, that I would sit with just her, so that she would know that someone really cares.

I had a student whose parents essentially threw him out in 9th grade. His aunt took him in. I met him on his first day of school. His aunt just had a baby who was resting in the arms of this student.

In his junior year, his aunt came in, concerned. Not much later, I was told the student was hospitalized for a drug overdose. Someone found him lying next to a dumpster.

Sure enough, after I passed out the worksheets to everyone, this kid just sat there not doing his assignment. The TA didn’t do anything about it, and I wasn’t sure what to do. Then the kid started ripping the pages out of his notebook, slowly and deliberately. The T

I had a first grade student my second year of teaching. About 17 years ago. I loved her dearly. Her mother did not like me as it turned out. One day her mom came to our school to complain about me. Her daughter had told her something I did, but being a six year old, it was taken totally out of context and sounded really terrible. So mom was there to let me have it - and that she did! But after the air was cleared and she learned that I didn’t do what she thought, she began to like me, and me her. Well over time, I became close with the family.

All of the action didn’t take place in my classroom, but I had a ten year old student once who was on medication. When his mother didn’t give it to him, I could tell from far away on the playground that he hadn’t had it. There was no soul in his eyes, and his behavior was, at times, uncontrollable. He would rip down my bulletin boards, sweep things off desks, crawl on the floor.

A few days later, while students were working on an assignment, I looked over at her desk. She had a large plastic bag and it was full of red pills with a few yellow pills.

No advanced notice, no call, no parent, no student, nothing. We just sat at my desk and waited. Eventually we just got the parent’s number and called her. She apparently decided that nothing would come of the meeting (she was wrong). So we sat on speake

One of the things that always got to me was the American obsession with street addresses. Many Canadians do not have street addresses, they have post office boxes. Many Canadians don’t live on streets, they live in the woods somewhere, or on an island with no roads. Many American companies didn’t seem to understand that. I have lived in towns where if you sent something to my street address, it would never get to me because the Post Office didn’t know where my street was. NO. Send it to the PO box. The Post Office will leave a card in my box. I’ll go and pick it up. I worked for a company that h

You ask a friend, a church, the business where you work…you arrange a payment with someone to use theirs… I’m guessing you’re asking because despite many of these answers suggesting getting a PO box, California for some of its services (Unemployment, etc) doesn’t recognize a PO box as a “residential address”…so you need one.

Once all of this is done, all you need a mailing address which you can obtain from many ‘travelling mailbox’ type service. An added benefit of a mailing address 
Let's see:  The few that can still afford a vehicle AND being able to register it can use the address of the homeless shelter or agency where they have been eating/staying to do this.They can also use the address of a friend, relative or acquaintance if they need to, although the reason why this person is not allowing them to also live with them may preclude this.In a few states, vehicle registrations can be mailed to PO box or mailing addresses so if the person still has some money they can do this.They can go into the DMV/BMV in person and in many cases receive a registration sticker after 
Technically, they are telling people that this is their address, not “using” it. You use an address by being a resident. You can’t really do anything about this person lying to others. Its only illegal for them to do this when they are getting direct financial gain (which would make this fraud), and it would be the person who lost money because of this lie that pursues justice, not you. And this might not even be a lie. Often the previous residents, possibly from years or decades back, have not updated their address and these companies are still sending mails to the old address, mistakenly. All y 
Well, if you are talking about the dmv mailing your license to you, it would depend on how far you are, or your post office you mail from is, from their office. But if you mean how long does it take for them to actually mail it, it would depend on a lot of things. I am sure each dmv has their time in which they try to get the new ones out by. But it would vary. You could call your dmv and ask how long it usually takes to get a license.

What is the most embarrassing ‘I want to talk to your manager’ you’ve seen?
This one seems like a lifetime ago. I had been working with a client who was having router trouble. The symptoms of a circuit outage were all there but there were no errors on our end. I wanted to check the router at the other end but the client insisted on keeping me locked out and checking for himself. It was his router, after all. “No, no errors here.” He demanded I keep looking into the issue as it was a critical communication channel. Fast forward to later in the evening. I had driven home but was directed to dial into work to continue to figure out the circuit problem. All indications fro 
“What is the most embarrassing ‘I want to talk to your manager’ you’ve seen?” I was working tech support for a high end printer company. There were three of us in a small group that only dealt with serious problems, and the only people who had access to us were the certified servicers out in the field. The company added a new member to the team, Harry, and he went out of his way to try and fit in, instead of just letting it happen naturally, so things were a little tense for a couple of weeks. One day he got on the phone with a servicer who was having problems following Harry’s solution process. 
I remember this one time where a woman ordered a soup and a coffee and sat down at a table beside a couple who were eating separately to her. Around a minute or two later my staff member had fixed up a soup for her and I had done her coffee and they were handed off to another staff member to take out and serve to her. Around that time the old man sitting as part of the couple noticed this woman had only just sat down and was served already, whilst he had been waiting a little longer than 5 minutes so far. He decided to start shouting at the young female server who had taken the soup and coffee 
I was once working the customer service desk at an Office Depot a few years back. What started off as an uneventful day, quickly became something that I would remember for the rest of my life. A co-worker and I had been sorting through a few returns, when a 30 something year old man storms through the front door. His eyes quickly scanned the store, as he raged towards his target: me. "Can I help you, sir?" "DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I'VE SPENT ON THIS PIECE OF SH** CALCULATOR?!" As he threw said calculator on the desk, he continued to yell at me. "YOU CALL YOURSELF AN OFFICE SUPPLY STORE?! HOW CAN YOU

When I was 17, I worked at a family owned restaurant. I was one of two non-familial employees and the only white one. A mid-30s African American woman walked in one day and asked me what was on the chicken club sandwich. As I was going through the list of toppings, she stopped and and asked, “why does it gotta be white American cheese?” I assumed she was joking around and laughed. Wrong move. She then became infuriated that I would “disrespect her like that” and called me a “racist, spoiled little girl”. She demanded to speak with the manager. I went back to the kitchen to grab the owner’s son  
Mine both come from my time back in the mid to late 80’s working at WalMart when I was in High School. I worked in the Electronics Department and we would get some of the BEST returns. This was when RCA released one of the first personal VHS Camcorders. The thing was a beast by today’s standards, taking a full sized VHS cassette. Basically a VCR with a mic and lens you carried on your shoulder. They were around $1200. Alot of money in 1986. On Fridays we would always sell 3 or four of them, and every Monday morning or afternoon they would all come back. You see, people figured out they could buy  
I was standing outside a patient room when my assistant manager came by, making rounds on the unit. We both watched General Hospital, and it was back in the early 1990s, when one of the characters was dying of AIDs and his girlfriend, the daughter of two beloved characters had just gotten her HIV test back. It was positive. Cathy and I were standing in the hall, speculating about how Robin and her boyfriend had been infected with HIV in the first place as the General Hospital theme started playing on the TV inside the patient room. Oops! That means it’s 2pm, and we both have medications to giv 
I worked at Applebee's the whole time I was in college. I had an African-American couple come in late one night. The girl was very quiet and the guy was very talkative and funny, overall they were very easy going and easy to serve. When I was taking their order, the guy ordered for both of them and he said he wanted two steaks smothered with all of our extra toppings. I let him know it would be an extra $3.99 per steak for the toppings, as I did for everyone who ordered them, and he said, “anything for my girl here!” They received their food without issue and ate it. After I brought the check, 
I was a participant. My teen daughter was embarrassed. I had been teaching her to be a good customer and also how to deal with problem merchandise. There were some items she needed to return and I would stand by as she dealt with a clerk so I could step in if there was an issue. Things went well returning some new tennis shoes whose soles separated, and with a shirt not fitting well. Then came the jeans whose stitching beside the zipper came apart on the first wearing. The clerk kept saying she could take back jeans with rips, tears, or holes, but was not allowed to accept dirty clothes. My da 
When a customer approached me as I was leaving and was already off the clock and I politely told them that this was the case and that any of the other sales associates in my department would be happy to help them, they acted as though they were “cool” with it, and then cowardly went and complained about me to the people at the customer service desk. This act of cowardice resulted in a confrontation several days later with a manager who completely sided with the customer and threw me under the bus bringing up similar incidents from the past as well and pretty much threatening my employment.

I was the 17 year old Assistant Manager of a now-defunct but then very popular fast food restaurant in central Ohio many years ago. My responsibility was the 6 girls running the cash registers at the counter. (Yes, they were all girls, between 16 and 20 years old. 16 year olds were High School dropouts, 20 year olds were struggling college students.) I asked my former boss about this - we’re still friends, 50 years later) and he said one girl did work in back. In retrospect, nearly all assignments there were based on sex, but I didn’t know that then.) One lunch hour a customer got very rude with 
This happened to an ex-girlfriend when she worked at a college offering IT lessons to older local residents. She was Spanish and spoke with a lovely accent. On the day in question an older gentleman had come into the reception. D. (let's call her) asked if she could help the gentleman with anything. He wanted to book a course which was no longer available. D. tried to explain to him he that he couldn't book that course. He insisted he wanted to book and for D. to stop arguing and just book it. This went on for five minutes or so until D. had had enough, In her lovely Spanish accent she said to hi 
I was in a hotel in Tunisia. The nightclub in the hotel was advertised as closing at 2am, but the night manager kept closing it at midnight so he could slope off early. After 3 nights of this, I see the owner during the day, across the expanse of marble reception area, where many patrons are lounging around quietly. I start the long deliberate march towards the owner, who turns and sees me approaching, sensing this was an incoming complaint, he steeled himself for my imminent confrontation….except half way there I realised that something was going on around my knees. I had no option but to kee 
I'm afraid I'm the one who was embarrassed. I was working at a cookie bakery after school and I was very tired and irritable one afternoon. A woman came in with her kids and I gave the youngest, loudest one a free sample. He was midway through an epic tantrum and I thought it would be nice if he had something to plug up his noise hole and give us all some peace. He grabbed the cookie and mashed it up against his still screaming mouth. "I'd like to see the manager." I groaned, petulantly, "What did I do?" I whined. "Your son wouldn't shut up! I just did what you should have done but go and complain 
Alright, so I could barely keep a straight face for this one. I was working as a cashier at Walmart at like 11:30pm. This customer comes theough with one stick of butter. Now at the Walmart I worked at, we don't sell single sticks, it all comes in four packs. I informed the customer of this. They admitted to taking it out of the box, but said I still had to ring it up at a discount because they couldn't afford a whole pack of four. So I said, there is not a barcode to ring for this item without the box, I cannot do it. They asked to speak to my manager. I said that was fine and we waited. When 
Well back in my Pizza days, I was the shift manager at nights and of course the weekend too. So everyone did their job they knew what to do. At least some of them needed a bit more supervision. So throughout the night the calls come through asking for discounted pizza or future credit saying that fine and dandy but at 15 minutes to close (midnight) that one drunk call saying their pizza was received cold. I looked back at the order and all my deliveries were good or have been solved. So this person drunkly demanded a new pizza and waited to call and complained. the staff sees this daily custom 
At the grocery store (large national chain) a woman lost it on a soft spoken young cashier because she wouldn’t take cash. We’re in the middle of a GLOBAL PANDEMIC and the woman is screaming at the poor girl because the current store policy is that they don’t accept cash - which is incredibly filthy on a regular day - just debit or credit only. Manager comes out to see what’s going on and the woman starts accusing him of violating her human rights by not taking cash. He’s tries to explain that they’re currently trying to protect the health and well-being of staff and customers alike and have tem 
It wasn't the manager I needed to talk to, it was the owner of this franchise! I walked in, ordered a simple breakfast w/ young son. The manager proceeded to loudly, verbally berate the employee who, kindly, took my order. Evidently something had triggered a nasty response from this manager. However, NOT in front of general public!! I told the female manager that I do not know, nor care about what particulars had ensued, that her behavior as manager was in question at this point. I demanded the name, contact phone number of owner, saying I'm not leaving without it. People behind me were listen 
I was 16 and working in retail. I had to put some merchandise on a high shelf. The shelf was on the end of an aisle so there maybe 3 feet of room. I setup a ladder, make sure that I am clear, and make my way up. When I got to the top most step I swung 1 foot over to the other side of the ladder. Well a woman decided that she could sneak past the ladder while I was climbing it. My foot grazed her shoulder. I immediately started apologizing and asked if she was alright. She said she was and then went on her way. About 30 minutes latter my manager comes up to me and asked what happened. I figured 
A family story. My grandmother worked at Johnson Space Center, the Lead for a department of about 30, as part of a Lockeed contract in the 60’s. Any other person (man) with this responsibility was a Manager, but that is another story. During a “discussion,” an unhappy employee wanted to escalate the issue to Employee Relations Manager (responsible for hiring, firing and labor negotiation etc.) a Mr. Thomas, who’s office was off site about 2 miles away. Apparently this fellow had missed a clue or two. “Yes” said my grandmother, “Lets call Bill right now”. “ You call Mr. Thomas, “Bill”” he said with 
A friend of mine worked in Brussels. I won't name the organisation, but it consists of more than 20 “member states” and is quite a large employer. My friend was a lowly IT technician. One day his boss called him into her office. “I have to deal with a complaint against you”, she said. “One of the department heads is saying that you haven't been responding to his requests for help”. “How's that?” asked my friend. “He's been hitting the ‘Help' key on his keyboard for three days now and nobody's gone to see him”. Much laughter, friend and boss went for lunch including excellent Belgian beer. 1.1K views · View upvotes · View shares431Stan Giles, President  at Stansireland (2010-present)Answered 1 year ago · Author has 287 answers and 176.8K answer views

I was the manager and the one embarrassed . We were shorthanded on a busier than normal Sunday night and I was the only manager on duty. I had to take care of a section of tables. I kept getting called away to take care of problems in other areas of the restaurant. I was doing the best I could but my customers were getting really shitty service.

The mother of someone I knew walked in and shouted 'Where's Timothy?’. I hesitantly walked towards her as I had never actually seen her before. She explains who she is. Then she starts telling about how awful the products are and how she wants a refund for the 3rd time of a product she has exchanged. I had no idea what to do. I'd been there 2 weeks maximum.

What is the most embarrassing situation that you have woken up to? I am one of 3 children in our family and the only son. Our parents brought us up sleeping naked, just as they do, because they say it is healthier. So I was raised thinking most people sleep naked. The couple living next door has 3 children, all girls. Their father is gone most of the time because he is a long-haul trucker. One day the neighbor lady’s father suffered a heart attack, so she wanted to fly home right away to be with him. But her husband wouldn’t be home for a couple of days and her children were too young to leave

I then started pouring myself some drinks and setting up some snacks before I turn on some porn on my huge projector tv. Couple hours goes by, I’m buzzing hard, and I’m absolutel

My sister and I have a knack for getting into questionable situations, but usually we're not really embarrassed by them. We don’t really care what people think of us, but we don’t enjoy being involved in predicaments where we cause complete chaos, and people end up asking us a lot of questions that we don’t want to answer. We would rather just glide through our environment without making much of a fuss. However… This can be difficult at times. We have lots of embarrassing types of situations to choose from, but the one that really stands out was at a nerd camp when we were about 15 or so. It was a  
I have, a number of times. And strangely, it was the same boy in the same situation every time. In school, we had to shower after PE class before changing back into our regular school clothes. We all showered in a large communal shower area and, just outside the shower was an area to dry off. At that age, I, like most boys, would try to subtly check out the other boys for comparison, not just penis size (although that was probably the comparison we most wanted to check) but whole body, too, like who had good muscles, hair in new places, etc. I remember there was one boy, Richard Z.

My wife and I often get up to naughty things in hotel bedrooms! This includes calling Room Service for drinks and then having a shower together, leaving both doors open and pretending not to hear the knock, and carry on having sex against the shower wall in full view! We have done this a few times and waited for a reaction. Sometimes the waiter stands watching for a couple of minutes, before leaving the drinks tray on a side table. On one occasion, he took the drinks back downstairs and rang our bedroom, saying he could not get an answer to his door knock. We knew for a fact he had been watching

I was watching me and my buddies girl fondling each other and all of A sudden they were leglocked and really getting into it and they both squirted at the same time all over each other and my buddies girl said all right you both can have each a turn on both of us watever you wanna do. To us but first you got to give each other a handjob and watch and I was out of that when a of sudden my reaches down and grabs my cock and is like really into it im like shocked and before I knew it I came all over his girl but couldn't do my part so I got to watch my buddy fuck both of them and it was finally o 
Can you describe a time that your company only discovered that you were irreplaceable after they fired you? How did you feel? What did they do?
I used to work for a small English training school in Hebei province, China. I wasn’t fired, but I learned while visiting my family in the US that my boss was intending to discontinue my contract after I returned. This was problematic, not only because I would be out of a job, but because, as an English teacher in China, I have a work visa and resident permit that would expire if my job contract wasn’t renewed or replaced. Also, I would only have one month left on my contract after returning from vacation, so I strongly suspected that my boss was hoping to use that desperation as leverage agai 
Well, not irreplaceable, but they did struggle after I left. Loads of Schadenfreude from my side. I used to work alone at the hotel reception on weekends, national holidays and when the boss and his sister, who shared their shifts during the week went on holidays. So, during the weekends I was the only one responsible for a hotel of 20 rooms. The first year it was alright with only a few minor issues, but those should have already told me that something was amiss. I had to be at the reception from 07:00 in the morning until 1pm in the afternoon. After that I had to be on call. Check-Out and Check 
Whatever job I’ve had since I left school I’ve given it 101% effort. Maybe not my first job or second job quite has much, but thereafter absolutely. I always tried to make myself indispensable, that way, I would be the last to be made redundant if it came to it. I started work in my third job at 18 working in a warehouse, but through hard work and people leaving the company, I was made in charge of the warehouse after just 3 years. I also had just one person to work with from 4 when I joined. So I had made the job for two people instead of four and I give it my all. Unfortunately though, the bu 
“Can you describe a time that your company only discovered that you were irreplaceable after they fired you? How did you feel? What did they do?” Well…. I encountered such.I was “the old one” in their architecture office. Me the first one which they associated hired (and who staid). Hereover in France there is a strong wall between architects and enginiers. Architects think that enginiers are good for nothing, just for to trouble them, for to hinder architects to make their beautiful work, their fabulous concepts, their magnificient projects.Well,sometimes some rare architects can grasp that 
Not irreplaceable just useful. I was freelancing for a defence company and my three month rolling contact was about to end, time to negotiate an extension, well that’s your agent’s job. Except mine didn’t so I had to. No problem the project is half way through and the client is happy with me. I negotiate a fair (to both parties) rate for a three month extension. I had a long weekend booked for a romantic trip to Paris at the end of the contract and explain to my agent that he needs to bring the new contract in for signing on the Friday. The romantic weekend was a disaster, I got food poisoning 
In 1988 I started working for a small electronics manufacturer. My childhood friend Gary worked there where his dad Johnny was a VP. Johnny was an asshole but he could see I was clean cut, respectable and a hard worker. I started out counting parts, moving pallets, and doing dumpster duty, I worked for a horrendous annoying bitch named Donna. She was about the most nasally, passive aggressive drama queen I had ever met. She made my life a living hell, but I needed the job. $4.85 per hour was almost 30% over minimum wage. So I put up with her crazy ass. This company had 30 employees and I was at  
How my boss realized I was irreplaceable: After leaving my previous job because my employers were dishonest, I found a new job as a purchaser for a real estate developer. We would find run-down houses to buy and then the developer would send work crews to rehabilitate the properties and then he would rent or re-sell them. My new boss had already hired a purchaser a few days before, but he decided to take a chance on me as well, hoping he could double his inflow of real estate. My new co-worker and I started work on the same day. My boss worked out of his home and there were 2 desks to choose from 
Maybe it would be nice to hear where a company DID realise you were valuable … I was working as a software developer for a large telecom company. Generally I didn’t have a huge amount to do, but occasionally I did - and there were no other software folk around. The company had written a truly awful call centre system (back in head office, in the UK - we were in Australia), and were trying to sell it. I looked at it, and came to the conclusion it was so awful, it was irrecoverable. (They eventually withdrew it from sale). So I thought, as a side project, I would write another from scratch, using m 
Hahaha something like that happened to me long ago. So, back then working in the IT world I joined a firm as a sort of an SME (subject matter expert). Their previous SME had left and they had tried to use the internal staff from the mainframe world to replace him. Needless to say, the mainframe guys were clueless about this new system and the previous SME was pretty much inaccessible. Further, the previous guy was a bit of a cowboy programmer and the system was a mish-mash of all sorts of technologies and what not. The system was breaking every day, clients were furious and they were going cra 
Well, I wasn’t fired. However, I found out that I was about to be replaced by a former employee, who was going to get paid $10k more annually and who was going to have fewer responsibilities. Needless to say I could see I was not valued. At that time I was working in a bakery that provided bread to about 150 local restaurants. We were a niche bakery that could provide these places with custom sizes of items, or proprietary recipes. I held numerous positions over the three years I was there. I had managed day and night shifts, managed production, filled in as a delivery driver, and so on; workin 
First, a preface: I was engineered out of a drug development lab. It wasn’t a “firing” per se but it was as close as you can get without it being a firing. I had a set last day after which I wouldn’t be allowed back. Honestly they should’ve just fired me: it would’ve been a lot easier on everyone involved. It was 4:30 p.m. in the lab and I hadn’t even started my sample prep yet. I already knew that I would be leaving at 8 p.m. at the earliest. Mind you I had arrived at 8:30 a.m that morning and had skipped lunch… again. George (not his real name) was shadowing me so he could see how I performed t 
In the 1990s I was working as a test engineer doing in-circuit and functional testing of PCBs for civil and military aircraft. The company I worked for had several different divisions. Their head office was in West London and I was working in a small factory in Loudwater, about 30 miles from London. The company was being restructured and the controls division where I was working was being physically relocated to the site of the head office. I was living 4 miles from the Loudwater factory and didn’t want to have a 30 mile commute into London every day (as the company wasn’t offering any extra mo 
In one sentence: They discovered I was an unrealized asset in a sticky situation. If you are interested beyond that feel free to read on. I, like many others, worked for a company that was sold to a large corporation. This Corporation had a long history of raping their ‘Acquired Assets” for what products and knowledge they had an immediate need for or desire for and dumping the rest. It didn’t matter if their acquisitions had hundreds of people making good marketable products that made healthy profits if they were products not within Corporate’s “scope”. They also had a “manage by lay-off” ment 
I moved back to my hometown and was casually looking for a job in construction estimating (my previous job in Florida). My sister had a coworker who’s husband was the branch manager of basically the “Dunder-Mifflin” of electrical distributors. I had worked in that field years before and wasn’t really interested, but after a month when nothing else was panning out I agreed to call him. He was very excited to hear from me, had already heard all about me and thought I’d be a great fit in his office selling electrical supplies. He even told me to come in and tour the facility right then- I told him 
I was the person who did the computer network set up of 105 computers from 40 and four different networks that were not connected. Additionally, I did the hardware maintenance, selection of new stations and installed software and customized some of the software . Some of the workers were slow to learn as they were too important and busy to run the tutorials or attend the training I provided. Because of fairly continuous issues, I found it best to come in at 400 AM and work until 800 AM, and return to work from 500 PM until 900 PM. This left the workers access to their computers during regular  
I don’t know about irreplaceable but I did lose my job in January 2016 as a result of failing my regular annual medical screening. My glucose was elevated and I was placed on hold until I manage to resolve my medical issue. That didn’t go as planned because the doctor treated me with medication that my company deemed unacceptable for someone working in the theater, therefore once I submitted my doctors report that was supposed to clear me to return to work, I ended up released from the project instead permanently. I was home for 4–5 months, unemployed, broke, struggling to find a job, any kind o 
I was let go as an IT director by a company during an economic decline since they thought they could get a cheaper deal via outsourcing. What they failed to notice, is what I actually did there! I had built the company VOIP phone system from scratch with Linux and Asterisk and made all changes. The mail and file server was also linux, which the new outsource firm had no experience with, they were a typical low end Windows only shop with a bunch of entry level techs. I had installed the financial system on which I was an expert, and since they had laid off the payroll admin, I was they only one w 
There aren’t irreplaceable employees, just ones that are hard to replace, and, usually, really poor planning. Any company with the brain of a gnat (not to offend gnats) recognize that “tribal knowledge” is bad, but “individual knowledge” is worse. This is usually what makes people feel “irreplaceable.” It isn’t they are special, or have unique skills, but they have knowledge that no one else has. If a company doesn’t address this, their business process will break, it is just a matter of time.When layoffs occur, many companies concentrate on numbers, not the tasks. I remember in one of my previ
I’m not sure that anyone is actually irreplaceable. The question, usually, is whether or not a company wants to pay the cost it will take to replace someone. Occasionally, however, you get a company that doesn’t realize just how much knowledge only a single person has before they are gone. I was working third shift receiving at Nordstrom Rack. It was not a glorious job, by any means, but it paid the bills at a time when I desperately needed the work. I started out as a grunt, hauling boxes off a truck in the middle of the night. Then I became the truck guy, who was responsible for coordinating  
Describe a time that your company only discovered that you were irreplaceable after they fired you. How did you feel? What did they do? In 1993, at 24 years old, I started working for a small, but shrinking software company, PC-Kwik (formerly Multisoft). I didn’t know they were shrinking until a couple of months after I started, when they had the first round of layoffs. I was doing technical support and while I started off a bit slow I managed to pick up all the basics of support PC-Kwik’s software and other utility software for PCs that we interacted with. Within a few months I was handling 30  
I was the sales tax department for a large, international distribution warehouse of electronic related items, that grossed around $285 million per year. I was the sales tax accounting. One person, me. I was the only one performing daily tasks like coding accounts as tax exempt. I think at the time there were roughly 38 States where we had Nexus - a brick and mortar sales office. I set up all of the State requirements as a new branch opened or moved. This involved primarily state licensing, but I had to verify if it was a county or city that required a license. These licenses were renewed annua 
this question has been bugging me for a while…till I remembered why. I have some experience although I wasn’t fired but I left I worked in my former law office for 5yrs+, I was far &amp; above the longest serving employee, the next longest person spent 18 months &amp; 6 months of those were on extended leave (some staff did a day &amp; quit, some did a week but invariably no one lasts more than a year) anyways, this was my first serious job so I was determined to give it my all &amp; learn all that I could but little did I know that I was doing an extended period in Hades. The 2 partners running the business ar 
I was hired by a family owned parts supply company after I called and inquired about work. I was put through to the owner, and he asked me to come right in after speaking to me. After seeing me, he offered me a job and I started the next day. I was extremely grateful for the position, and did very well right away. After a few months on the job, I went out to lunch with a customer, who in turn invited two other technicians. During lunch, one of the friends boasted about the scheme he had in place with my manager in Spanish, thinking I would not understand. I was fluent in Spanish, and I caught o 
What did the job interviewer say that made you NOT accept the job offer?
It was the whole interview, and it was more of a combination of “too good to be true", and a gut instinct which made me hesitate in accepting the role. I was 18, naive, inexperienced and had just completed my first year of training as an accountant. So altogether not very impressive at this stage: the first rung on a ladder of 5-7 years plus, about equivalent to 1 GCSE/high school grade - in other words still very green/junior. I'd been out of work and looking for a new job for a couple of months, and had applied for one which was a slight stretch for my current position, but I thought it might  
When i came back from Libya, my brother helped me to get a job. He met a woman in a night club - they were talking together and she told him: “I work in a job agency - send your sister to me.” When i arrived in the agency (i had sent my documents before by e-mail), she said: ”My boss wants to talk to you - sorry.” I went to the boss’s office. It was a “lady”. Why quotation marks? She did not even greet me, she pointed on a chair and started talking: “Why do you think you will get hired here in Switzerland?” I wanted to answer but she was on a roll: “I now tell you how people perceive your CV! And 
In my industry, there’s a vast shortage of skilled, experienced professionals. It’s not exactly difficult to get a job; even easier an interview. So, the companies compete need to put in effort attracting talent, especially the devoted nerdy kind who’s passionate about the code. Bossing applicant into submission.— ”Tell my why I should hire you.”— ”Oh, if you don’t know that by now, you probably shouldn’t…” [walks towards the door]2. Pushing responsibility onto applicant.— ”Tell me why you want to work here.”— ”I know to little for an informed decision but I was hoping that you’d tell me.” 
What did the job interviewer say that made you NOT accept the job offer? “Our devs normally work about a 12-hour day…” When I was still up North and looking for a way to relocate further South, I got a hit from a small younger company that needed a lead software dev for their dev group. The person on the phone was describing the software product as a database-backed “Business Intelligence” system (remember when people first started using the term “BI” and it was a buzzword?). Company structure was basically two tiers - the president of the company and everyone else. These kinds of environments ca 
At the conclusion of an interview for a company in need of a general HR Manager, I realized this was one of those great experiences where I hit it off with the General Manager and the other people on the hiring panel. We were laughing and sharing stories off the record and pens down. We clicked and I had a great feeling, which just intensified when the GM asked me to stick around so the owner could meet me. About ten minutes later, I stood up to greet a gruff-looking older man in a well-worn suit. He looked like an air traffic controller in the middle of a bad storm with fifty birds in the air, 
I was interviewing for a bartender position, at a very upscale restaurant. Usually, this position pays a small hourly wage, because it's going to be supplemented by tips, as well as tip out from the servers. The manager was offering a hourly rate much higher than normal, so I was really interested in the position. We went over my experience, my knowledge of spirits and wines, and the job seemed in the bag. We talked about my availability, and then, almost as I was leaving, he mentioned that I would only be in the bar for maybe two shifts a week, the other three, I'd be a server on the dining roo 
I was 25 and was already looking for a career change. I was grinding it out in the financial world and wanted to get in touch with my creative side so naturally I go the opposite way from being at a bulge bracket bank. I apply to a startup. I applied through my alma mater’s job portal which directly hit the founding team’s inbox. It was for a Biz Dev job that I knew I could do well in. The next day, I get an email asking if I would be available to come in for an interview that same week. I agree and was very excited. I like it when things are quick. I come in and enter the building to their office  
I’ll go one step further and describe an interview that actually led to me calling the HR executive team afterwards and warning of a lawsuit. I was interviewing at a large insurance company that will remain nameless. They had me come in to meet with the new sales manager. I was told they had been cleaning house, and this was the guy that would “save the branch.” Well… he was an idiot and knew nothing about sales, and I figured that out rather quickly. For those that don’t understand sales, or get a bad taste in their mouths just hearing about it, let me be clear that it is not an easy job, but i 
There were two instances of this happening. Both of them were while I had a job and was just looking to see what was out there, so there was no need to just take a job. I am an industrial mechanic/journeyman millwright with over 25 years experience. In the last 10 years or so, it has been an employee’s market, with more job openings than qualified applicants. It also must be said that this is an area of industry that is full of job hoppers. Experienced industrial mechanics can get another job in less than 2 weeks of searching and will leave a job for any reason and move on elsewhere. Having a lo 
I had been working as a software developer in a university research lab. I was getting really tired of what I was doing for a variety of reasons and thought it time to look for something else. I didn't know quite what I wanted to do, but conveniently I received a phone call from someone looking to hire a programmer for a big company that found my name somewhere. I figured it was worth interviewing even though it wasn’t a company I was particularly interested in working for. My previous jobs had pretty much fallen into my lap and I had no experience interviewing in a corporate setting. This was 
This question takes me back… Long, long ago in a galaxy far far away… I was in a job I absolutely hated. The requirements were a mandatory 70 hour work week with no overtime and the pay was below market rate. I’d taken the job during a terrible recession and was just happy to have income at the time. But every day was a horror I couldn’t wait to escape. I received an interview with a huge multinational not far from where I lived. Yay! I’d interviewed a lot to that point, trying to escape my awful job, and it was a recession so lots of interviewing with little results. I knew the drill. 1 - 2 hou 
Several years ago i was pretty down on my luck thanks to an injury. I was forced to quit my job and desperately needed anything to stay afloat I applied for all kinds of jobs left and right, one of the first ones to call me back was for cleaning hotel rooms at a new hotel. The pay was abysmal but it was work. So i get up early do my hair and put my dress suit on and arrive half an hour early with a copy of my brand new revised resume. Manager isn’t there yet so i’m taken to where they hold meetings and asked to wait. No problem i sit down get comfy go over my resume and wait. An hour later, thirt 
Waay back in 2007 I was a fresh IT graduate and was looking for a job. At one place I sat for a technical test followed by a non technical interview. Once finished I was asked to wait for the final interview with the big boss (it was a medium sized startup). At the interview he said he was very impressed by my CV and the test results. After a little chat he said he would like to offer 50% of what I asked and if I worked really hard I would earn another 25% in 6 months. Then he asked if I had plans to further my studies, to which I replied that I wanted to start my MBA. His reply was to forget a 
After 18 years of driving trucks in and around Southern California, I moved to Pennsylvania. I'll be the first one to admit that driving trucks in those two very different states are two very different experiences. For example, Southern California does not have to deal with snow and ice except on rare occasions and even on those rare occasions, it is both a minimal and short-lived event. When it seemed obvious that the original job situation I had accepted upon moving so far away from my home was not going to be as fruitful as I had hoped, I felt compelled to begin looking for trucking work in  
“People usually ask their parents for the money.” I didn’t consider this to be a real job interview after the fact, but it was presented as a real interview for a real job. Some things have changed for the better since my “interview” in June 2003. You may be familiar with Vector Marketing, which sells the Cutco brand of knives and kitchen tools. They are the ones who put up those generic-looking ads on telephone poles, with only a phone number and a misleading offer that says something like “make $17.95 an hour”. When I got to the “interview” I had agreed to with the “secretary” over e-mail, I ha 
I was interviewing for a position with a large company in the early 80’s. There was a three phase interview process. The first phase was more ensuring the paper work and credentials were all proper and in order and was fairly stress free and included the “vision” of the company. I was told that this was a highly competitive position and I was “lucky” to have been selected to participate. Phase two was the meat and potatoes of the interview process. A lot of questions, some personal, some technical in the field. A thorough review of all the documents provided in phase one and overall, one of tho 
I’ve already answered this on another question, but this is too important not to repeat. I had a job interview May or June 2019 to be an armed security guard for banks. It was going to be a Monday-Friday 8–5 job close to home and I’d be paid about $15/hr. I decided not to accept the offer because one of the interviewers was being extremely rude to me. I’ll try to put the security stuff in laymen’s terms as best as I can. When he came into his office to interview me, he immediately yelled, “You know, YOU JOB HOP AROUND A LOT!” Then the interviewer kept on asking “You worked at (this job) for (thi 
I once got a door-to door sales job for a small paper products company. There was a Nintendo wii in the lobby and a cute bulldog sleeping in his little his bed in the corner. The interview with the lead executive was smooth, he was so charismatic! Needless to say I was super impressed. The first day of training the same exec gave a hoo-rah “go get em tigers" speech then I was sent into a car with my trainer and another new applicant. We drove from business park to business park trying to force our way into people's wallets. 90% of the businesses had signs that should have stopped us at the door 
“What business is McDonald’s in?” The three 20-something young men sat across a table from me. I’d just returned to the States from a couple of years living abroad, and it was time to find a job. Back then (18 years ago), the newspaper classifieds were still a pretty good resource for job hunters. The description had been a bit vague (classifieds were usually short), but the promised wage was decent, so I sent in a résumé, and got an interview. When I arrived, I waited in a stairwell outside a sparsely furnished office with another guy about my age (20-something), until my interview slot (the la 
I had been with the same company for around 12 years and got an itch to interview with a competitor. They flew me to their corporate offices, which weren’t quite as nice as the corporate offices where I was currently working, but I’d be working remotely, so that didn’t really bother me much. I interviewed with the company’s CTO. We’d been having a great chat, and the interview was going really well. Then he looked down at my resume again, and said: you’ve worked for a great, stable company for more than 10 years. Why do you want to leave? You must have a hell of a network there. I just looked at 
They said starting pay is $15hr. I guess let me give you a back story I was called and asked to interview for a job as a delivery driver for a auto parts junk yard. I have vast experience fixing cars, and selling parts, and even have mangeal experience. I knew I was over qualified for the driver job, and I knew there was no way they would be able pay me what I want (at least $18hr as that was what I was making at my current job) as a driver, but my hope was I would show up, they would see that and say well we have this better position we are looking to fill and offer me that. So sure enough th 
One offer soured me on both managers and headhunters (recruiters)! I was bored with my first job after 3 years. A headhunter found me an opportunity but it was almost an hour drive from home instead of 15 minutes. Hmm. Yet the hiring manager liked me for the job, and I liked the opportunity. Then the hiring manager called and offered the job. However the proffered salary was less than I was already making! (As I vaguely recall I was earning $29K, which I'd already told them… and the offer was closer to $27K!) Excuse me??? I said stunned. Well, he explained, the fee for the headhunter is pretty st 
This was at the beginning of my career. I think I had around a year’s experience in recruitment. This role was a sales role with an IT company and there would be elements of recruitment as and when necessary. Since, I was looking, and it was something new to learn, I decided to go for it. The interview went well, but one thing I was not clear about were the working days and hours. So I asked. And this is when it went downhill. She said, “Our official working hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. with a 30-minute break.” Okay. That’s fair. That is in accordance with the law. It sounds reasonable. Th 
Thrice I’ve refused any further action. Once because I was lied to, the second because there were so many laws broken in a span of 5 minutes that it wasn’t even funny, the third because I was almost scammed. The first was when I tried to get on with a yellow dollar store. I applied for a position at one of the two stores in my town. I got the interview but it was about 40 minutes away, which seemed odd at first, but I figured that was where the interviewer was for the day. After all of the boring interview stuff I was asked where I would like to train. I could either train at the 40 minutes aw 
I was working some lousy, low-paying job where we worked 4AM-12:30PM. The pay was minimum wage and the only reason why I had kept it was because it had full insurance benefits and paid vacation. Otherwise, they probably would never have gotten anyone to take the job at all. One day, a co-worker tells me about a job in the photo department of a large, national retail chain box store a few miles away from where the office is located. He said they were desperate for help. I was seeking almost anything that would free me from that full-time job, so I went to talk to the guy. I thought he was looki 
I work in the software industry in US East Coast. I got an opportunity to interview with a small company (had never heard of it) that reached out to me on LinkedIn. It was a niche industry - I wasn't sure if I wanted to join the company but still decided to move forward and learn about the company, see if I like it. I cleared the phone screen and met with about 6 people for my onsite interviews. I liked the company domain and all the people I met. One of the people I spoke with was the CTO of the company - we were originally scheduled for 30 minutes but we spoke quite a bit and it went over by 
This is slightly different in that I DID accept the job, but quit on my first day. I was unemployed and a new father and was desperate for a job. Even though I have a postgraduate degree, I couldn't seem to get even an interview anywhere. I was willing to do anything that paid a wage, but wasn't getting interviews, let alone a job. I eventually got an interview for a crappy sales job. I didn't want to work there but I needed the money and at least they would interview me. I turned up in my nicest suit and tried really hard to make a good impression. There were quite a few of us, and it was a grou 
“I have resigned, and I have nominated you to replace me.” I had interviewed successfully for a senior role in the IS team of a major enterprise in another city. In this role, I would be heading the infrastructure team, reporting to the CIO. I would have around 25 people reporting to me, and the overall IS team reporting to her was around 100. The CIO was an extremely high-profile leader in the industry, and from our interactions we got on very well. I looked forward to working with her, and learning heaps from her. Let’s call her Karen. The company prepared the offer, which included a generous  
I needed the job, very badly. I had been looking for work for more than 8 months after graduating college, and I didn't want to go back to doing pick packing, which was very intense labor. I took 3 buses and walked on the side of the road. (There were no sidewalks, and it had snowed for days, so a 15-minute walk took over 30 minutes.) The whole trip from my apartment took over 2 hours to make, so if I were to accept the role, I would spend 4 hours commuting everyday. But again, I needed the job. My interview was successful, and I knew it. I was interviewed by a panel, which is pretty typical in 
As a wholesale auto dealer I buy franchise dealership trade ins in packages of late model expensive cars and old model cheap cars, good with bad and sell them to different independent used auto dealers that only buy each of the category of vehicle so they aren’t buying ones they don’t want to get ones they do and I have a dealer back me financially and provide license/insurance/etc for a portion of the profit. I’d had one such dealer with a reputation of having almost unlimited resources tell me a few times he’d make me a better deal than I had so I eventually asked to hear this great deal he’d 
One job I applied for took 3 months to call me back. When they called me back they wanted to hire me at less money than I wanted and wanted me to start immediately as opposed to letting me give my present employer a reasonable amount of time to replace me. The other instances that come to mind. Are when I go to an employer with all the motivation in the world and they treat me like they're doing me a favor to hire me. I am a highly skilled highly motivated potential member of your team. I expect Fair compensation for me to do the job that you're potentially hiring me to do. I'm not your slave.  
I left the Indian Navy after 20 years and joined the Merchant Navy. At that time the law allowed naval officers to obtain a Certificate of Service as Master (Captain) based on their naval service. On leaving the Navy, since I had no merchant naval training or experience in cargo work, marine law etc I joined as a 2nd Mate and did one contract of 6 months. Though the company had promised to promote me to Chief Mate, when the time came for reassignment they asked me to join as 2nd Mate. I refused. I then went to Mumbai, where most shipping companies were based, to look for a Chief Mate vacancy. A 
This happened way back in 2016 when I had graduated as a computer engineer, and there were placements going on in college. It would be all of our first job, after college so mostly students were clueless about what it was going to be about. We were prepared with basic aptitude, decent programming skills and some general questions. Placement interviews went on for long hours. It was close to ten at night that my turn arrived. And the moment I entered the room, the interviewers (3 men) welcomed me. Everything went well, they asked me questions about myself, my skill set, my knowledge of HTML CSS  
One of my favorite interviews was just after I left the US Air Force. At the time I was stationed in the UK and interviewed for a help desk position in Watford, very close to London. I got to the office in time and checked in. The receptionist was expecting me and told me that the manager was stuck in traffic and they were not sure how long it would be. I told them I was ok to wait. The manager showed up 45 minutes later (not a big deal to me as I know London traffic can be horrible) sporting a massive cold. Sniffling, coughing and such. He led me to a very small room (just a table and 2 chairs 
It wasn’t what she said but rather what she didn’t say. The ‘interview’ was at a busy time for the shop, and I was immediately handed an apron and hair net and told to do a trial shift. No instruction, no tour of the place, nobody to help me out. Not even a quick “food safety 101”. (Customers are lucky I worked food service before, but if there had been a food poisoning outbreak, I would NOT be taking responsibility.) Just, “Kay go and serve customers now”… After a few embarrassing screw-ups of me having to ask the customer how to do their food; “Sorry sir I’m new, is the chicken pie the red or ye 
I applied for this really cool temporary position with Cold Spring Harbor, a research institution, right as I was graduating with my PhD. The job was two years long, and the project was to write a book. (!!!) They wanted a book called “The 100 year history of biotechnology at cold spring harbor” or something like that. I applied in July when I saw the ad. I got a call a few weeks later and the woman in charge of the project interviewed me over Skype. I'd never done that before, and it was exciting to use video technology in that way. This was in back in 2011. The job was in New York on their re 
I was referred to this company that was owned by a local pastor for an office manager role and I was excited to get an interview because the pay was good. However the interview started out quite strangely.. the Pastor asked me to join him in a brief prayer before we began. I should have probably got up and left at this point but no, I sat there and pretended to pray after looking through my resume, he ran through the basic interview questions which I answered with delight and from the way he was nodding and smiling to each answer, I could tell I was saying exactly what he wanted to hear. It didn't 
The first time I can remember knowing immediately I didn't want to work somewhere was when the small company I worked at was acquired by another small company. The new owner decided to talk with each of us and did a few things, 1) He made the mistake of assuming I would just come over to the new organization 2) he made certain that I understood there would be no pay raise and we would no longer be eligible for any bonus 3) for no apparent reason he felt the need to give me a tour of his newly remodeled office suite with its own private bathroom. I finished the discussion and politely let him kno 
“YOU’RE KEVIN KENNEDY?” I was asked this, for the third time during my visit to a potential employer, as if for some reason my identity, resume and stated job history were all a lie. A job I was (at the time) interested in, for a wing of a large telecom company. I had a great phone interview, as the person conducting the interview asked quite a few questions and immediately set up an interview with me the following Monday. I arrived, 15 minutes early, dressed in my favorite two-piece suit, my favorite tie, and my shoes were freshly polished. As I entered the office, the secretary looked up, seemin 
Not the job offer, but after the interviewer told something I didn’t turn up for the next round of interview. We had a casual interview over a cup of coffee. After all the common interview questions, the interviewer asked me if there is anything that I need to know. Me: May I know why did the earlier person resign? Interviewer: Haaa. She wasn’t a great designer. She couldn’t cope with us and didn’t meet our expectations. So she left within a couple of months. But you seem to be an excellent match for us. If that’s all from your end, I will continue to explain our work culture. *nodded excitedly* Int 
Not the job interviewer, but a consultancy agent. I had been looking for jobs for almost 3 months now after around a year of gap. Marriage, moving to different city, different country were all contributing factors for the delay in me getting a job. At the end I had 3 offers: A great position - contract to hire developer in a company 5 miles to home. A good position - paying significantly lower amount in downtown for a major financial institution. An ok position - very close to the house. I chose the first option, accepted the offer letter and was looking forward to start at my earliest. The third op 
I got a call from a good university. Close to home via train. The pay is okay (7.5 marked out of 10) with travel perks. I have made it to the final interview with the research director and the following remarks/situation made me cringe. I would be on-call every Saturday without pay.I would be working on an average of 12 hours every day, beating all the deadlines without an OT pay. I can at least work for an extra hour or two without compensation but not a full four hours every single day.Five senior researchers and two junior staffs suddenly resigned within a month. I asked why and the director s
Many years ago. The job looked technically interesting. It was where I needed to move to, and for domestic reasons I needed to move there quickly, so I needed a new job quite urgently. The MD seemed to really want me for the post which I found flattering (I was young at the time). But he didn't want to meet my salary level — though the recruitment agency he was using had told him in advance what I was looking for. Something about the place made me slightly uneasy, and I really couldn't afford to take the salary he wanted to offer, but I needed to move, so we left it that he'd like to see if he co 
I applied for a job as a housekeeper at a local hotel. I did not fill out the application expecting it to be a perfect job, but it was something I could do during the hours my daughter was in school. It was one of the few jobs in the area that gave me the option of working mornings and being home in the afternoons. I knew it was going to be hard work, but it was a trade-off I accepted. It did not surprise me when they called me back for an interview almost immediately and I went to the interview expecting to walk out with a job. Everything went as planned, and she started explaining more about th 
I received a verbal offer for a Director of Marketing position at a well-known international chain company. The GM and hiring manager rush me to come in and meet the team during the directors meeting, and also take covid test beforehand. He said the paperwork will follow on my first day because they don’t want me to second guessing and go with another company. I should’ve sense that this is a bad sign but I was desperate for a job and it’s a great position. On my first day (the Directors meeting), the Hiring Manager introduced me to the others. The GM suddenly cut in and say: “Yeah whatever, sh 
My first interview was a sting. I opted for a marketer in a small company, who were introducing black mushrooms into the market. I was ready to set the first interview of my life, with a tint of nervousness aching in my head.  The introduction was done, and I sounded impressive because of my prior knowledge of mushrooms and some of its health benefits. I was telling them I could explain a lot of things, about mushrooms as I had an ongoing science degree. Everything was going right, but one executive, a white-shirted lean youngster was listening the entire time with no questions. I did not underst 
A bit of context: I’m French Canadian, but my parents are Lebanese and they both speak a different second language. I grew up in a trilingual household, so I’ve acquired a slight accent in every language I’m fluent in (French, English and Arabic). I must also add that I’m probably most comfortable speaking French. I find that my French vocabulary is more rich. In 2018, I had a Skype interview for a position in Eastern Quebec. A position that’d require me to verbally communicate pretty much all day. The interview was solid and the stars seemed to align. Until the manager asked me: “Would you be c 
A recruiter got in touch with me through Linkedin regarding an opportunity to work for a luxury car brand. I gave her my number and asked her to call after 4 pm because I didn’t want to take the call at work. She rang that evening, we went through my work history and I emailed her my CV. In the morning she rang back to say that the hiring manager liked my cv and wanted to schedule a phone interview. The following day, I received a call from a gentleman who introduced himself as my interviewer. I went through my work history once again. I answered his questions, gave examples to support my answers 
I was interviewing at a doctor's office. They brought me in to start the interview and were showing me their system on the computer. It was filled with various colors that had to be changed depending on when the person got there, when they were called in, and all of these ridiculous details that had to be put in throughout each person's moment in the office. I thought it was ridiculous and redundant. Then, as they let me observe the patients coming in, it turned out to be an office where they were constantly prescribing Ritalin and other medications for children. They would ask them the same t 
While the interviewer did not say this, it was something written by the HR department. I was talked into flying from LA (Santa Ana airport actually) to Miami on a red eye flight for am interview. The whole thing sounded pretty good but the first bad sign when getting off the plane was the oppressive humidity. When I got here an HR clerk gave me a form with a series of statements where I had to sign after each one to indicate I agreed to them. I omitted to sign the one that said that anything anyone there told me about salary, work conditions, either verbally or in writing did not mean anything un
