What's your story of being pregnant?
I am anonymous for this answer for the privacy of me and the girl. This is not the story of me being pregnant, but of my girlfriend at the time. I was friends with a a girl from school.

We were never so much in love - I do not think we intended to date forever. But we were happy that we were a couple. One day, I got a call from her. So much crying.

What should I do? I am 12 weeks pregnant with twins, 1 of which is acardiac and growing just as fast as the pump twin. What is your advice?
If giving birth is very painful, why don't doctors give anesthesia during delivery?
I have been a doula for nearly 15 years, and I have had three children who are 23, 19 and 16. I’m also a mental health counselor, and this is the lens through which I answer this question. Your question needs clarification. When you say “anesthesia,” you might be interested to know that it means anything given or administered for the purpose of relieving, controlling or blocking pain. It does NOT mean “going under” exclusively. The story of anesthesia in childbirth is interesting—it is social and scientific. Briefly, human women have almost always given birth in the presence of other women (midw 

Recently there has been a huge debate on Chinese social media about whether or not women should use anesthesia during childbirth, and if the mother has the right to choose between a C-section or vaginal delivery. The debate was triggered by a tragic event: Ma Rong Rong was a 26 year old first time mother. She was in the hospital waiting to give birth. During her prenatal examination, the doctor discovered that the fetus' head was too big. There was a risk at attempting a vaginal delivery, and they suggested a C-section. However, believing that “natural birth" was the best option, Ma and her ent 

Well how is a woman suppose to push out a baby under anesthetics? They can’t, so there has to be a cesarean done, which is becoming way too common in first world countries. So now a new mother’s body has to deal with the after affects of a surgery and deal with all the stress of being a new mother. That primary moment of bonding has also been lost, so now the mother is at risk for postpartum depression. There is also the problem of what goes into the mother’s body, can cross over into the babies body if things aren’t timed just right. The more you mess with nature, the more trouble you’re causi 

When my mother gave birth to me in the 1960’s, she was anesthetized to the point of unconsciousness. My mother was very proud that she was in a virtual coma at the time I was born as she had no interest in experiencing the discomforts of childbirth. Because she was unable to push me out, I was removed with forceps and my head was badly cut up, or so I was later told. My mother claimed never to have missed not being cognizant for my birth. Although this angers me, if I put in into perspective, she had to witness her own mother limping along in crippling pain after having lost her babies to obste 

As a family Physician / Internist I have assisted in the delivery of my own patients both vaginal and via C-section. I’m can say with experience that when a C-section is done in competent and skillful hands the procedure is relatively safe for both the mother and the baby. In legal circles obstetric malpractice suits have been in cases where a C-sections should’ve been done early. For those that have watched a C-section you will see the surgeon standing ready, scalpel in hand, awaiting for the go-ahead from the anesthesiologist and within one minute or less that baby is safely out of the womb. 

There are many excellent answers here. And that, to me, truly illustrates why doctors don't give anesthesia during delivery. There are millions and millions of aspects of birth to consider, and one carbon copy approach simply doesn't work. In addition to the health risks of general anesthesia to mother and baby, I personally would have a very difficult time working with contractions and following the doctor’s carefully timed “Push!” if I was under anesthesia! Walking also helps progress labor for many women and that's not an option for any kind of anesthesia. General anesthesia is reserved for em 

As a mother who has had 4 children all by vaginal delivery. My oldest son was born naturally without the aid of any medications, not by choice but because I declined the first time for any anesthesia which is an epidermal. Later on I decided that I wanted to change my mind, the doctor was rude and told me I was way past that point so I continued with my natural delivery. My daughter I decided to go naturally and never wanted the epidural even though I regretted it way into labor because my labor with her was hell not due to pain but because she actually got stuck and after hours of trying to pus 

I’ve only had one child and I can only give a limited opinion. I am sure if I had more kids I would have a wider experience of childbirth. In my situation, I gave birth vaginally with gas and air (aka entonox) I do not think I was especially brave at all. I just had an instinct that further pain relief would not work for me. In retrospect, I think even the gas and air slowed up the labour contractions, because I was so tired. If I could choose I would wish to go into labour in the morning, after a good nights sleep, give birth in the late afternoon, then have a good night sleep thereafter. No  

I did not find labor and delivery all that painful. It is extremely hard WORK though, and if you are not fit and flexible, or accustomed to hard work, I suppose very hard work IS painful. The worst of it was the literally half a minute of time when the babies heads popped out. I sorta wish I had had Novocaine for a spot there, but if I had had that, and could not feel the stresses on the tissues of my body, would I have torn them more? I don’t know. I think people pay too much attention to their own labor instead of staying busy for awhile… It is a LONG haul. When you pay close attention to str 

I do not understand why more women are not informed about Hypnobirthing? Why the reliance on strong pain meds? Anaesthesia during delivery sounds pretty extreme. The mum needs to push and help the birth I’d imagine, and being out cold can’t be much help? Also, what about consciously bonding with the baby when he/she is born? Here’s a video by the UK NHS(National Health Service). I’m surprised they’ve got a video about it, but yet, I’m unaware of women using this option en masse.  http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA333448746&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;lin 

Does giving birth feel similar to intense menstrual cramping? What does childbirth (sans epidural) actually feel like?
I think this answer will vary quite a bit depending on the individual and it will also vary somewhat from labor to labor, depending on the conditions of that labor. Here’s my personal take after 4, very fast, unmedicated labors (the longest was 6.5 hours). Warning that the answers below are blunt and detailed. . . . I do not find most of labor itself to be painful, it’s hard work, like training really hard for an athletic event when you’ve been out of shape for a long time. However, certain scenarios are more or less painful for me. Back labor is extremely painful during an unmedicated birth. Back la 

It can. It’s a pretty variable process. It’s really rare for there not to be an ebb and flow at some point, but it’s possible. It most cases there is a change in frequency and intensity as time goes on, so any feeling is possible, but it’s only to be the only feeling. Just like everything to do with kids, everything is a phase, even the good parts! My first was not in the proper position so I got to experience a whole different set of feelings while my body tried to work that out. At first, yeah, it was like a hell of a cramp… that kept coming back. Then it’s became a set of 3 different feeling 

It’s been a considerably long time since I’ve had my kids, but I can certainly tell remember the pain of child birth. My answer about pain from contractions is that at the beginning of labor they are similar to menstrual cramps. But as they progress the become incredibly more intense. I didn’t have have an epidural or use any pain medication, because I was so young and deathly afraid of needles at the time. As my labor progressed the pain changed, my abdomen hardened and the contractions began to radiate into my lower back. It’s like nothing I had ever felt before. It was like a knife being tu 

**Long story alert - read only if you want to ** I have always had excruciating periods ever since I started them at 10 years of age. So I was kinda glad to not go through them while I was pregnant with my first, though it was an unplanned pregnancy. My pregnancy was entirely trouble free except for the fact that I had huge hemorrhoids from around the 6th month, severe water retention and had gained an enormous amount of weight. This also ended up causing preeclampsia towards the end of my pregnancy and when I was at 38 weeks my doctor decided that it’s better to induce me and get the baby out  

I have given birth three times vaginally; once with no medical intervention beginning to end, once with foley bulb induction and pitocin augmentation and then an epidural placed actually literally as the dear thing came down the birth canal (idiots), and once with a pitocin augmentation and cervidil placement after rupture of membranes. I got the epidural about 13 hours in, and that’s a whole story… This is a big question. My list went from last to first. I can tell you that the birth without the epidural did not feel like intense menstrual cramping- there’s a human in there trying to get out. W 

I've had four natural births so I think I qualify to answer this. I'm going to be 100% honest, as I wish someone had been with me before I gave birth for the first time. I found it so annoying when I asked someone who had already been through labour and birth what it was like, as I was desperate to know what I was in for, and they would be really vague and say things like “It’s not pleasant but it’s so worth it" or “Yes it hurts but you forget about the pain when the baby is in your arms." Yes, that's all well and good but I wanted to know what it actually felt like. Especially the baby coming  

I didn’t realize I was going into labor, because the midwife said that after getting my membranes swept, I might experience cramping. So I figured it was just cramps. Really bad cramps. That came every seven minutes and lasted two minutes and had a definite beginning, intensification, and end. After a while it became clear to me that this wasn’t just cramps. Contractions were (1) significantly more painful than anything I have ever experienced before and (2) had distinct phases. This is helpful, because you know if you can just survive to the peak, it’s easier after that. That’s really what most 

So, I've given birth three different ways; the 1st was an emergency c-section, never want to do that again, the scariest thing I’ve been through! The next 4 were VBACs, and in case its relevant, my babies weren't big really birth weights, the low side of 5, 7, 6, 6 &amp; 7lbs... My 2nd baby, after 30+ hours of labor I was finally given the epidural at the last minute because the Dr kept saying its too late but then realized it wasn't too late after all and gave it to me. #3 I gave birth to in under 30 minutes after finally getting to the hospital, so no time for epidural. 4th, last minute got the  

Disclaimer: I am a chronic pain patient. I live pain, I know pain, and because of that, my perspective is skewed. At 31 weeks 5 days pregnant, I went to work. I had a meeting at 9am and on the way there I noted that my low back hurt. My low back always hurts and always hurts in that quality, this was more intense than usual, but I was pregnant so of course my back pain would worsen. I went to the meeting. On the way back to the office, I called my significant other and said this was the worst back pain ever. I finished out my day. At 10:21pm right as I was about to fall asleep I first felt a str 

The short answer? Yes. Only I won’t say “intense menstrual cramping.” I would say “the cramps from hell.” Either I completely missed my earliest contractions or I didn’t have any. I started with regular five minute contractions, and I knew immediately what they were. At first it wasn’t painful or even unpleasant. By the time my contractions were three minutes apart, they hurt, but they weren’t very long and I had a lot of recovery time between. Unfortunately, I wasn’t dilating. My contractions were about a minute apart and completely stalled. I’d been in labor for 16 hours when I decided I want

What is the worst reaction you've ever witnessed to a pregnancy announcement?
What is your opinion on "Free Bleeding"?
Frankly, as a girl, I absolutely hate it.  What is free bleeding exactly? Free bleeding is the process of menstruating without using something to block or collect the period flow. Why is this even being practised now? Lack of finance.Destigmatising menstruation.Anecdotal effects.What the hell do I hate about it? I'm getting to it. Menstruating is the most normal thing for women everywhere across the world. They bleed for 5–8 days monthly and experience little to intense(me 😢) period cramps. We're just shedding the uterus lining that nourishes the egg that will probably become a new life because we m 

My opinion on free bleeding is that it is something very few women have done once or twice to spread awareness about the shame associated with periods- AS A STATEMENT- and that people who haven’t researched it like to freak out and exaggerate about and use to try to make a point along the lines of, “Look at these psycho feminists!!!!” It’s also something that thousands, possibly millions of women have to do because they have no choice. The activist women doing so as a form of free speech are doing it in order to spread awareness about those women. It is estimated that 1 in 10 girls miss school 

Free bleeding is something that started on 4chan to make fun of women and feminists. As said in the article linked in the question, it was outed as a hoax. Then a woman marathon runner chose to free bleed during a marathon she ran, saying it would be stressful to worry about a tampon leaking the whole time.

Good Lord, there're so many women in the answers telling that periods are disgusting. What’s even the problem with it? Blood is just blood. There are people who faint just looking at it, of course. My sister, for example. I’ve never noticed her fainting at the toilet or bathroom though, so even she manages somehow. Menstrual blood is the blood from the uterus. The uterus is a human organ. That’s the problem of bleeding from it? If you have ulcers you can bleed from your stomach, You can bleed from your throat if you damage it (hihi, I don’t want to try imagining circumstances).

Free Bleeding and I have a complicated relationship. I must admit, when I first came into contact with this concept, I was genuinely confused (and rather naive). I thought, is there even a way to simply stop bleeding? Have we ever been restricted from bleeding? If we haven’t, then haven’t we always been free to bleed? When I looked at the true face of the movement, I must admit that I was angry. Disgusted. Even horrified. I thought, how dare they. How dare they believe that they can speak for the marginalised women of third-world countries who have no access to menstrual products? How dare they

Does giving birth feel similar to intense menstrual cramping? What does childbirth (sans epidural) actually feel like?
I think this answer will vary quite a bit depending on the individual and it will also vary somewhat from labor to labor, depending on the conditions of that labor. Here’s my personal take after 4, very fast, unmedicated labors (the longest was 6.5 hours). Warning that the answers below are blunt and detailed. . . . I do not find most of labor itself to be painful, it’s hard work, like training really hard for an athletic event when you’ve been out of shape for a long time. However, certain scenarios are more or less painful for me. Back labor is extremely painful during an unmedicated birth. Back la 

It can. It’s a pretty variable process. It’s really rare for there not to be an ebb and flow at some point, but it’s possible. It most cases there is a change in frequency and intensity as time goes on, so any feeling is possible, but it’s only to be the only feeling. Just like everything to do with kids, everything is a phase, even the good parts! My first was not in the proper position so I got to experience a whole different set of feelings while my body tried to work that out. At first, yeah, it was like a hell of a cramp… that kept coming back. Then it’s became a set of 3 different feeling 

It’s been a considerably long time since I’ve had my kids, but I can certainly tell remember the pain of child birth. My answer about pain from contractions is that at the beginning of labor they are similar to menstrual cramps. But as they progress the become incredibly more intense. I didn’t have have an epidural or use any pain medication, because I was so young and deathly afraid of needles at the time. As my labor progressed the pain changed, my abdomen hardened and the contractions began to radiate into my lower back. It’s like nothing I had ever felt before. It was like a knife being tu 

**Long story alert - read only if you want to ** I have always had excruciating periods ever since I started them at 10 years of age. So I was kinda glad to not go through them while I was pregnant with my first, though it was an unplanned pregnancy. My pregnancy was entirely trouble free except for the fact that I had huge hemorrhoids from around the 6th month, severe water retention and had gained an enormous amount of weight. This also ended up causing preeclampsia towards the end of my pregnancy and when I was at 38 weeks my doctor decided that it’s better to induce me and get the baby out  

I have given birth three times vaginally; once with no medical intervention beginning to end, once with foley bulb induction and pitocin augmentation and then an epidural placed actually literally as the dear thing came down the birth canal (idiots), and once with a pitocin augmentation and cervidil placement after rupture of membranes. I got the epidural about 13 hours in, and that’s a whole story… This is a big question. My list went from last to first. I can tell you that the birth without the epidural did not feel like intense menstrual cramping- there’s a human in there trying to get out. W 

I've had four natural births so I think I qualify to answer this. I'm going to be 100% honest, as I wish someone had been with me before I gave birth for the first time. I found it so annoying when I asked someone who had already been through labour and birth what it was like, as I was desperate to know what I was in for, and they would be really vague and say things like “It’s not pleasant but it’s so worth it" or “Yes it hurts but you forget about the pain when the baby is in your arms." Yes, that's all well and good but I wanted to know what it actually felt like. Especially the baby coming  

I didn’t realize I was going into labor, because the midwife said that after getting my membranes swept, I might experience cramping. So I figured it was just cramps. Really bad cramps. That came every seven minutes and lasted two minutes and had a definite beginning, intensification, and end. After a while it became clear to me that this wasn’t just cramps. Contractions were (1) significantly more painful than anything I have ever experienced before and (2) had distinct phases. This is helpful, because you know if you can just survive to the peak, it’s easier after that. That’s really what most 

So, I've given birth three different ways; the 1st was an emergency c-section, never want to do that again, the scariest thing I’ve been through! The next 4 were VBACs, and in case its relevant, my babies weren't big really birth weights, the low side of 5, 7, 6, 6 &amp; 7lbs... My 2nd baby, after 30+ hours of labor I was finally given the epidural at the last minute because the Dr kept saying its too late but then realized it wasn't too late after all and gave it to me. #3 I gave birth to in under 30 minutes after finally getting to the hospital, so no time for epidural. 4th, last minute got the  

Disclaimer: I am a chronic pain patient. I live pain, I know pain, and because of that, my perspective is skewed. At 31 weeks 5 days pregnant, I went to work. I had a meeting at 9am and on the way there I noted that my low back hurt. My low back always hurts and always hurts in that quality, this was more intense than usual, but I was pregnant so of course my back pain would worsen. I went to the meeting. On the way back to the office, I called my significant other and said this was the worst back pain ever. I finished out my day. At 10:21pm right as I was about to fall asleep I first felt a str 

The short answer? Yes. Only I won’t say “intense menstrual cramping.” I would say “the cramps from hell.” Either I completely missed my earliest contractions or I didn’t have any. I started with regular five minute contractions, and I knew immediately what they were. At first it wasn’t painful or even unpleasant. By the time my contractions were three minutes apart, they hurt, but they weren’t very long and I had a lot of recovery time between. Unfortunately, I wasn’t dilating. My contractions were about a minute apart and completely stalled. I’d been in labor for 16 hours when I decided I want

What is your opinion on "Free Bleeding"?
Frankly, as a girl, I absolutely hate it.  What is free bleeding exactly? Free bleeding is the process of menstruating without using something to block or collect the period flow. Why is this even being practised now? Lack of finance.Destigmatising menstruation.Anecdotal effects.What the hell do I hate about it? I'm getting to it. Menstruating is the most normal thing for women everywhere across the world. They bleed for 5–8 days monthly and experience little to intense(me 😢) period cramps. We're just shedding the uterus lining that nourishes the egg that will probably become a new life because we m 

My opinion on free bleeding is that it is something very few women have done once or twice to spread awareness about the shame associated with periods- AS A STATEMENT- and that people who haven’t researched it like to freak out and exaggerate about and use to try to make a point along the lines of, “Look at these psycho feminists!!!!” It’s also something that thousands, possibly millions of women have to do because they have no choice. The activist women doing so as a form of free speech are doing it in order to spread awareness about those women. It is estimated that 1 in 10 girls miss school 

Free bleeding is something that started on 4chan to make fun of women and feminists. As said in the article linked in the question, it was outed as a hoax. Then a woman marathon runner chose to free bleed during a marathon she ran, saying it would be stressful to worry about a tampon leaking the whole time. She ran with blood running down her legs instead of being embarrassed. Honesty, this is one of the only instances where I can understand free bleeding.

Was pregnancy and giving birth harder for you after 35?
I was pregnant with my 1st daughter when I was 27, it's fairly easy although I lived alone and my husband was abroad. Not much morning sickness, only craving loads of food. I gained total 28kgs and my daughter was born only 2.7kg. The 2nd pregnancy came as a surprised, I was 28 and very much not ready for anything. I was too tired as my husband working abroad and rarely home and the 1st baby is just 16month when I delivered my son. I lost my baby weight from 1st pregnancy through breastfeeding and all that. I worked 7 to 5 daily. The 2nd pregnancy was a bit difficult, too tired, and never endin 

When I became pregnant at 21, I was in excellent shape. I worked out 4–5 times a week. I could bench my weight and do more squats than my husband who was into lifting. I didn't start wearing maternity clothes until I was 7 months pregnant because I didn't need them until then. Sometimes I forgot I was even pregnant. The people at the gym always joked that I was going to go into labor there. My labor was quick. I had an epidural, pushed 3 times and had a 7lb 11oz 21.5 inch baby. I didn't tear or need stitches. I got out of bed immediately after with tons of energy. I walked out of the hospital th 

I definitely may be the exception to the rule but my first baby at 25 was not necessarily a difficult pregnancy(until the end), but had a bad outcome. I was used to working full time on my feet with few breaks but it was not conducive with pregnancy. I developed a terrible kidney infection in month 8 and I was given all kinds of antibiotics, couldn’t have been safe for pregnancy(this was 1982). My son was stillborn full term a month later. Ugh. Not an easy time. My second son was born a year later to the day. Pregnancy was fairly easy but this time I stopped working early and had gestational di 

My husband and I tried to have a baby together for several years; after three miscarriages during the first trimester we decided not to actively try anymore and accept not having another child (he has an adult daughter from a previous relationship). Lo and behold….when you stop trying is when it happens, right? I found myself (happily) pregnant at 40. Overall I had a very healthy pregnancy; experienced some nausea during first and second trimesters but was strangely comforted by it since it meant strong hormones, healthy growing baby. I was also very careful about my diet (no fried foods, lots 

I had my oldest at 19. The pregnancy was normal and birth was normal. Nothing out of the”ordinary” other than I was given an epidural because they thought they might have to do a c-section cause the cord was around his neck. They didn't end up doing a c-section and baby was fine. My second labour at 25 was harder. I was induced a week past my due date and went into hard labour very quickly. So quickly, in fact, that they didn't have a birthing room ready till shortly before I was ready to push. I had a bit of tearing but nothing crazy. Baby #3 at 27 was much different.

You cannot go by someone else. Everyone is different. Each body is different. Please do not let someone else's pregnancy determine what you do. I have friend who had babies before and after, both were the same. Easy, no issues. I have friends who had more troubles before 35 and after 35 their pregnancy was easy, no issues. My best friend’s niece had a baby at 25. She followed up 2 years later with her second, and her baby had down's syndrome. This child is a joy to all. They wanted more kids, but were afraid. Then 8 years later, Jack was a great surprise to their family. He didn't have down sy 

I had my first daughter at 33, and my 2nd at 35. Both pregnancies were pretty normal and healthy. After the first trimester I had tons of energy. I ran a half marathon at 6 months pregnant with my first and 7.5 months with my second. I’m a massage therapist and worked right up to the day I had my first. Did 4 massages and went to the hospital after work and had a baby. I took a week off before the birth with my second to get stuff ready….having a 2 yr old to care for, I didn’t have time to nest as much! With the first, I tore my water and had to be induced.

No, I had my middle son and my youngest at 35 and 39 respectively. My middle son’s birth was an easy 7 hours of labor and with the epidural I felt non of the pushing and my youngest son’s birth was less than 5 hours and I honest couldn’t believe when it was time to push because I couldn’t feel a thing. My daughter who I had at 33 and my first was the longest and by far the hardest labor. The labor probably lasted 20 hours if u remember correctly. For some reason when I got to the hospital which I waited til I was in labor over 12 hours he epidural did not take. I remember feeling so much pain  

I Had a set of twins at 38 and a singleton at 40. Easy pregnancies, no nausea of any kind, wouldn’t know I was pregnant if it wasn’t planed, fit into my normal clothes till about 5+ months in both cases, except I had to put a rubber band on my jeans button for a little extra stomach lol, gained about 30lb with twins and 25lb with the singleton was back to normal weight about 5 months later, nursed both times.

What is it like to have periods?
How long can a still baby stay in the uterus?
My experience with this situation was very different from the previous answer posted(so sorry you lost your baby especially during the holidays). I on the other hand was 6 months pregnant when I felt my baby ball up like a fist in my uterus, after this she simply stopped moving for the duration of my pregnancy. I will never forget this was exactly one week after my birthday June 11, 2011. Her father and I had been fighting continuously and although I knew this was a stressful environment, I did not think it could affect the life of my unborn child. Well, now I know this feeling was incorrect.  

I know several people who were forced to carry their still babies for waaaay too long after finding out they were still. My sister for one. All of them it drove them crazy. I am not saying that lightly. I do not for the life of me understand why they would force them to carry until they go into natural labour. Can that be considered a lazy doctor? A heartless doctor? I dont know. It was cruel and a very specific kind of torture for sure. They all still suffer from this. When they are very down, this is the event that surfaces for them. Just horrible. One girl I remember carried hers for ten da 

I lost my most recent child 14 weeks ago now at 16 weeks 3 days into my pregnancy in a silent miscarriage. I knew there was something wrong and pushed for an unscheduled scan because I had been able to feel it move early (due to a muscle gap) and it had stopped for quite a while. My daughter brought home Parvovirus B19 or slapped cheek syndrome from school which I wasn’t naturally immune to, and although it’s very rare was fatally passed onto the baby. The sonography showed it had died at approximately 14 weeks gestation so nearly 2.5 weeks previously. Decomposition often begins almost immediate 

I had a full term, healthy boy. Then 4 miscarriages. It was because I had low levels of progesterone hormone, needed to maintain pregnancy. I was a Neonatal nurse and midwife. I did my job but it was hard. Then I conceived again, but was hardly excited. My doctor arranged for me to have weekly injections of progesterone and ordered a batch to be delivered to him. He rang me one morning and said the drug had arrived. I agreed to collect it. As my husband was a nurse, he was going to do the injections, a stressful time, as they were thick and oily and hurt like hell, and he got stressed giving the 

I lost my baby at 35 weeks. On a Monday evening I felt a huge kick from her, which I now know was the exact moment she died. I was in a birth preparation class in the basement of the hospital, if you can believe that. Tuesday I felt as though I was getting sick, just very “punky” and, I am sorry to say, I focused on feeling ill throughout the day. Wednesday morning I realized I hadn’t felt her move recently, and we got in to see my MD. I will never forget the ultrasound tech searching for a heartbeat, then saying to herself when she saw the screen, “this baby is already dead.” There was someth 

There are rare cases where a fetus died and was “fossilized” by calcium deposition inside the body. This can go on for the life of the mother — the body has protected itself and didn’t need to force it out. But this IS extremely rare, and normally, a fetus which has died will begin to decompose as the cells of the fetus go through the automatic “destruct” sequence called apoptosis. This can happen within hours, or take days, depending on how the fetus has died. To summarize the various articles I read on this some years ago — the body will attempt to remove it once the placenta begins to decay. 

I had a missed abortion in 1969. I don’t remember the timeline but I do remember that the baby moved at about 4 months. I had two other babies and it did not seem to be as active as they were. A few months later my hands hurt so bad I could barely sleep and my nose was very red. I was told later that I had some kind of infection that affected the baby and most likely would have caused the baby to be blind and/or deaf had it been born. I do know I carried the dead baby for at least 2 months after that because I have a Christmas picture of me with my red nose and I went into labor in February. I  

On January 10th I went to the Emergency room. I was 16 weeks and 2 days pregnant with what should have been my third child. I had an unshakable feeling of doom, despite no bleeding or cramping. 5 weeks before a scan showed our little one healthy &amp; moving like crazy. It was determined to be a 10 week and 5 day fetus that day. At the E.R. I was given a pregnancy test that was positive. The Dr ordered an ultrasound which I chose to have the screen turned away from my field of view. Instinctively I already knew they'd find no heartbeat. I chose to return home and “deliver” naturally. Which I did, t 

First, I’m incredibly sorry for the loss of whoever is looking for the answer to this. Please take time to take care of yourself and grieve. Unfortunately there is a large medical concern at stake. If you have a baby that has been active in the uterus but is no longer active, you need to seek medical attention right away. The next day is preferable. Your tech or your doctor will do an ultrasound to determine whether it has passed away. If the baby has passed it is important for you to birth it because otherwise it will turn septic and you could die if it is still in you. If the baby has passed  

I went through this 3 years ago. This is hard for me to write and i have yet to get to it and i have tears in my eyes. I had a miscarriage. I was at the appointment to see what gender my child was.

My husband is so tickled we are having a second child, (our son has had a hell of story, but he tells it as i do too.) I noticed my weight dropped, 5 pounds, and i asked to talk to the drs because of flutter or butterfly type feeling i had. My son and husband kindly went out the exam room. The dr the 

How do you tell your parents your period started?
I simply tell him that I'm on my period! I only have a father, I don't have a mother. But he has always been very, very open with me about pretty much everything! Seriously, he's the most amazing dad. So one day we were at the supermarket, I was about 10 or 11 and we walk past the feminine hygiene isle and he just casually (even though I think he planned it) tells me: “Do you know what this stuff is?” And I'm like “yeah, sort of” (I knew women get periods but that's all, and I never thought of me as a woman until then, just a child). So he says “maybe we should buy some, so we’re ready when you n 

Oh god, this is going to be embarrassing. I should mention that I was given the period talk when I was around 11 but never really paid it much attention. The first time was traumatic, I was 12 when I discovered brown spots on my underwear one day. It went on for two days and I got worried so I whispered it to my mum. “Mum, I found brown spots on my underwear.” “Are they large brown spots? Are they at the back of your underwear?” “No they're small and at the front.” “If it becomes painful tell me immediately.” I don't think it occurred to us it might be me getting my period because I am the only gir 

I was 14 when I got my first period. Thankfully, my parents had admitted me in a really nice school near Chandigarh (Bhavan Vidyalaya, Pkl.) whose authorities organised sessions for girls, imparting almost all information with respect to periods and other aspects of adolescence, taught us what happens in the uterus, how to use sanitary napkins and tampons, etc. Also, my then best friend had her first period before I, and I took the liberty to ask her what happened and how she realised it was menses. I had joined Mathematics tuitions and my tuition teacher was particularly strict. That evening,  

this wasn’t to a parent, but it was to a teacher. ever since my first period, my cramps have been borderline unbearable pn the first day(I later learned that this was partially due to, at the time, undiagnosed PCOS), and ever since I left high school, I basically make the choice to not leave my bed, pop some pain meds, and take my ass to sleep as soon as possible, at least on the first day. anyway, one day in 10th grade, my period had started RIGHT BEFORE I was supposed to leave for school, not kidding, like 2 minutes prior, and we were out of painkillers at home, so I just muttered “today is

Never announced it. My mom only knew because she would notice some of her “supplies” missing. She had her own bathroom, and on one side of the toilet, a little space between the cabinet, there were stacks of tampons and pads. I was never comfortable using tampons because they felt and still feel funny. One time in a huff, since our cycles never matched, she told my dad someone used all the pads and she didn't have any. Oops. I wasn't picky, as long as it held up. My parents have been married for over 30 years, and I'm not sure my dad ever bought the right brand/absorbency that she preferred. Aft

I am the younger one. My sister got her first period neither too early nor too late—just the right age to have them. She had mild cramps on those days and must have gone through other normal stuff like everyone else (I did not know what all a period is about as it was not much talked abou 

Well, In this era periods are no such issue as it used to be earlier. Now , most of parents understand this and are already prepared for this. But still many girls have bitter experiences with this . Also including me. Hello….. Firstly I would like to tell you my background at the time of my first period so that you can understand my situation well. I was admitted to Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in class VI after qualifying the entrance exam. Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya's are residential schools where both girls and boys hostel are available. And every student studying there has to live in hostel.  

Secret women’s business is not to be discussed with my father. Nuh uh. No way. Doesn’t want to hear about it. With my Mom, it’s a non issue, we can talk about it openly. My Husband’s mother is a nurse, and she’ll straight up ask me about it if I mention I’m not feeling well– among other questions that used to be embarrassing back when I first met her. Now it’s the norm, and I discuss my monthly cycle– amongst other personal medical things– quite openly with my MIL. My Husband’s father on the other hand… “I was going to drop you two off at your mother’s house right after dinner if that’s alright,” my 

I'm guessing this means for the first time? When I got my period for the first time, I was in Florida USA on vacation with my father, his common law partner, my brother and her three children. This woman was a real piece of work. I won't go into details, but she was abusive toward me and my brother, both physically and emotionally. My mom was trying to get custody of us and eventually was successful, but those two years were hell, she made sure of it, and this happened to fall in those two years. So, we were going to the mall that day, and I was wearing a skirt. As I got into the van to go to th 

Why is the pregnancy period 9 months in Western countries? <br>Because in South Korea we usually says pregnancy 10 months.
As a teacher, has a student ever started their period in class? If so, how did you handle it?

Last year I was teaching in a college in rural Thailand. I speak intermediate Thai but have not learned the vocabulary yet for puberty, periods, and the like (it wasn’t top of my expected day to day conversation list). One of my girls entered the class and looked a little pale and unhappy. While everyone was getting sorted and coming in, I asked her if she was ok. She said she had a tummy ache. Food poisoning and dodgy tummies are very common in Thailand, so I asked if she ate something cooked badly, and she said it wasn't bad food. I teach in the countryside, in a remote area. Girls are very re 

I’m Not a teacher- but the student whom this happened to… Oh, and It was recently, to, last month! I arrived at school, feeling sick as hell, but I just went about my day. When I was in homeroom waiting for class to start (I had PE first period), I noticed I had a small dark red stain on my light blue denim shorts, and me, not wanting to get in trouble for skipping class, (my locker and tampons where on the third floor, gym was on the first) I assumed I’d be able to last until 2nd period. I was wrong… That day we where doing “activities” about this book we read over the summer… What are we, 5  

Boy, do I have a tale! I used to teach fourth graders. Fourth graders are usually 9–10 years of age. Normally, girls would have their first periods one to three years after this age, or so I thought. So dealing with first-time periods or periods in general is never something I expected to deal with as a teacher of fourth graders until one day. This girl was usually one of the most talkative in class, that I got used to looking her way to make sure all’s good, or give her “the look” to quiet her down. Relax. I’m not Nanny McPhee. Sometimes I have to work harder than just giving the look, to get t 

 Although I’m not a teacher, I can tell you how my geometry teacher in high school handled it when this happened… So, there was this quiet mousy girl named Glenda who sat in front of my table in geometry class. The tables were set in long rows horizontally so it would be 2 to a table. My buddies and I all sat together in the back row so there were 4 of us. Glenda sat alone right in front of my seat. Anyhow, my buddy Trae noticed as she stood up to go sharpen a pencil or whatever it was that she got up for, that Glenda had gotten her period pretty heavily in, wouldn’t that be the luck, white shor 

I am not a teacher, but I write this to thank the amazing teacher I had when I had my first period at school. I was about 12 or 13, the middle of the school day. I had health class (thank gosh, as my mother did not speak abut such things, except to give me a box of pads about 6 months earlier with zero explanation).So I went to the restroom, and luckily, I caught it early, so no embarrassing stain, but I had no coins with me for the machine, and obviously no supplies. I actually had a male teacher for the next class (the bell had rung so I was late for class, but I had a little shock, and had 

In 11th grade I was in a Philosophy class taught by my favourite male teacher. It was the first or second class of the day I had horrendous cramps that morning. They were more intense than usual but I decided to stick it out for the rest of class before going to the bathroom to make sure I was okay. Plus our classroom was in portables outside of the school at the time and it was chilly out so I had no intention of embracing the fall weather more than I needed to. Towards the end of class my stomach felt like it was being ringed out like a wet towel. I couldn’t bear it and decided I needed to wa 

I'm not a teacher, but I was this student. I was in a special school because I was misbehaving and having emotional issues. So, small class sizes and teachers that are trained for students that need a little extra help. I was 13. I wore those UFO pants and no underwear (don't ask.) I felt my period coming on, out of no where. Those pants are thin too. It was like there was nothing between me and the chair. The teacher was a sweet and kind young lady. She could tell I was distressed. Either my friend went up to let the her know, or I raised my hand, and she came over and let me whisper it to her. 

I've had that encounter with my grade 9 class. In every class you have your hyper active learners, your serious, participating learners and you have those who want to be clowns and that makes your class, which is perfectly fine. One of my girls who is very active in my class and more of a teachers pet expirienced her periods for the first time. It was very easy to notice that there was something not going right because she was just so quiet and down which is very odd coming from her. It was very worrying to me so I checked the time and the lesson was just about to be over. The bell rang and the  

Of course yes! This happened a few months back. I was teaching biology in class 8 menstruation topic. After I finish teaching a topic I will generally ask students to read that topic from their book. Suddenly this girl stood up. I thought she might be having some doubt. She walked up to me and asked me if I could come out. She calmly told me…”I think I am menstruating”. I was a bit taken aback as I hv just taught the topic. But she knew about it. She asked me if I have a sanitary napkin. I gave her one and she knew how to use it. She was comfortable. Still I asked her if she would like to go h 

I am a male to begin with but pls don't judge.. I guess you don't have to go through periods to understand it This was when I was in my 8th or 9th std (not aware of periods ). So in our class the teacher's allowed the girls to go out during classes (the girls would go up to the teacher say something near her ears and she got the pass to go out) but never allowed boys outside class hrs. We had 20 boys and 22 girls in the class and 15 for sure we're having periods (this was something I learnt much later). So one day I went to my teacher got near her and said “I want to use the washroom room” (like  

What is your opinion on "Free Bleeding"?
Frankly, as a girl, I absolutely hate it.  What is free bleeding exactly? Free bleeding is the process of menstruating without using something to block or collect the period flow. Why is this even being practised now? Lack of finance.Destigmatising menstruation.Anecdotal effects.What the hell do I hate about it? I'm getting to it. Menstruating is the most normal thing for women everywhere across the world. They bleed for 5–8 days monthly and experience little to intense(me 😢) period cramps. We're just shedding the uterus lining that nourishes the egg that will probably become a new life because we m 

My opinion on free bleeding is that it is something very few women have done once or twice to spread awareness about the shame associated with periods- AS A STATEMENT- and that people who haven’t researched it like to freak out and exaggerate about and use to try to make a point along the lines of, “Look at these psycho feminists!!!!” It’s also something that thousands, possibly millions of women have to do because they have no choice. The activist women doing so as a form of free speech are doing it in order to spread awareness about those women. It is estimated that 1 in 10 girls miss school 

Free bleeding is something that started on 4chan to make fun of women and feminists. As said in the article linked in the question, it was outed as a hoax. Then a woman marathon runner chose to free bleed during a marathon she ran, saying it would be stressful to worry about a tampon leaking the whole time. She ran with blood running down her legs instead of being embarrassed. Honesty, this is one of the only instances where I can understand free bleeding. She kind of seemed stuck, she’s in the middle of running a marathon. What is she supposed to do? The biggest thing that bothers me about fre 

Good Lord, there're so many women in the answers telling that periods are disgusting. What’s even the problem with it? Blood is just blood. There are people who faint just looking at it, of course. My sister, for example. I’ve never noticed her fainting at the toilet or bathroom though, so even she manages somehow. Menstrual blood is the blood from the uterus. The uterus is a human organ. That’s the problem of bleeding from it? If you have ulcers you can bleed from your stomach, You can bleed from your throat if you damage it (hihi, I don’t want to try imagining circumstances). You can bleed fro 

Free Bleeding and I have a complicated relationship. I must admit, when I first came into contact with this concept, I was genuinely confused (and rather naive). I thought, is there even a way to simply stop bleeding? Have we ever been restricted from bleeding? If we haven’t, then haven’t we always been free to bleed? When I looked at the true face of the movement, I must admit that I was angry. Disgusted. Even horrified. I thought, how dare they. How dare they believe that they can speak for the marginalised women of third-world countries who have no access to menstrual products? How dare they

It's disgusting.  I'm not a feminist, but I used to be (more like "she hates men"). Honestly, with all the fuss they're making right now, I'd be embarrassed to do it.

But, it seems like it doesn't hurt and she doesn't care. She goes to your cafe and sits in the chair next to you. She stains the site with blood, along with her clothing, which is white.

Free bleeding is the practice of menstruating without blocking or collecting the period flow. It has been used to challenge period stigma and taboos, to protest the high prices of period products, and to draw attention to the environmental issues relating to disposable pads and tampons.

What do Vedas and Upanishads say about menstruation?
What is it like to have periods?
Overview:2-5 days leading up to the period: Everything is going well, but then I accidentally burn the toast, no big deal, except I find myself overcome with irrational rage. Deep breath, "Walk it off Lynn. Get it together!" I tell myself.... Then I see a puppy on TV. I break down in tears. What is wrong with me? Be cool.  I cry again.  This time for no reason, well, unless you count how the "piece of dirt" in the Swiffer commercial just got picked up.  SPCA commercials, with Nina van Horn and Sarah McLachlan? ugh. game. over.  I'll just make out with that guy in my livingroom, so I can stop cryi 

Mmmm. Mm. About two days before it actually comes, you suddenly become psychic and/or paranoid and start thinking things like "whoa, it's been a while since my last period, hope everything's ok"… "Oh, it's not here, I'm probably infertile and I'll never have children and I'm probably going to die" and then you're sitting somewhere and you feel a slight stirring in the lower part of your stomach. Nothing major. But then it hits you and you just freeze for a second like in a movie and say "it's here". During the first two or three days, it is extremely heavy. This is when you feel like someone has 

Note: major TMI, read at your risk men and women: Well, you are sleeping happily and wake up in a ok mood. Only as you shift you feel a dampness. Now, you have just brought these awesome white pj bottoms that you love and have your light colored bedsheets. You stall, afraid to remove your blankets and look. You know you either peed yourself or bled out of your clothes and you actually wish for pee because it's easier to clean. However, you push yourself out of bed and there on your beautiful light blue sheets is blood. You look in your full length mirror and yep you bled out. Which means your pa 

What is it like to have periods??? When I was in class VIII… May be April 2004… I was 11 years old… I was so innocent…I didn't know anything about so called periods…and the topics in biology comes in Class X… I remember going to restroom about 9.00 pm after having dinner…suddenly I saw blood…after going to urine…I thought something is wrong with me… my stomach started paining so much..I thought I had some big health problem like Cancer or something…I cleaned everything and went to my mother to tell what I saw..

Please note this is my personal experience, other people may feel completely different. It starts out with a painful tightness in your stomach, your due for this week so you know what that means, in a few hours to around 3 days that new underwear you got from Victoria’s Secret will be stained. You could get up and put in a tampon just in case but your deeply focused on work or, trying to work through these cramps that is. Ugh, your stomach feels there’s a huge bubble in your ovaries, about to burst and spray blood everywhere. (Which is actually what happens by the way) 2 days pass. Your at a fa 

I am a man. I have no way of experiencing it, but I have seen teens going through it. I have observed. One time while I was teaching in my class, I could hear some commotion outside the classroom. I walked outside. I could see a group of girls escorting a little girl who was obviously struggling to walk. Her legs were intertwined like strands of noodles. She was limping in little steps. Tiny faltering steps. The girls flanking were almost carrying her, with her legs dragging behind her. I could see spots of blood dripping as the group drifted by. Just when the girls had taken a few steps further, I  

Oh lucky you!!! I’m on my period right now, so I can definitely help!! And yes, I’ll be describing the problems with the breasts. Imagine having water balloons on your chest. And then they turn into metal balls that burn and ache like they’re being compressed by a couple elephants whenever you press down at all with a finger. And they become extremely sensitive, too- they’re being held up and sometimes you get lines from the wire in the bras, in addition to your breasts becoming really itchy because of the fabric as soon as you’re on your period- but you can’t scratch it, because remember, you p 

*Warning: Contains graphic descriptions of blood and allusions towards sex I had my first period at the not so tender age of 17 on my first day of college, so it was a pretty rude awakening to finally understand what all the other girls were complaining about. Menstruation is a sacred time of a woman’s life where her body expresses the extent of it’s femininity and… screw that nonsense. Let me tell you the 100% unfiltered version of how having a period really is: You bleed for 5–7 days straight and don’t die. That’s both impressive and miserable at the same time.Some days you wake up in a pool of

Boys &amp; men have periods but not like girls and women having their period.About every six weeks, the body will cause his sperm and semen to release on its own.The releasing os semen and sperm can happen when they are sleeping or wake.It can happen at school, dinner table, playing outside, changing room or any other activities.Preteen boys and teens males never know when it will happen.At the moment it happens they feel as they need to go and pee.They do not wear male napkin as girls and women wear females napkins.When it happens, it releases out onto his underwear.If they are naked that a strea

And it lasts for days! Some women have it so bad, they can not get up for a second. Imagine your boss telling you “Period is a part of life and shouldn’t prevent you from working”.

Is it rude to ask if a girl is on her period?
YES IT IS. NO IT'S NOT. ..it depends solely on the way one asks or the intention one asks with. Periods are natural. They will occur but making a big fuss about it makes pretty much every girl uneasy. When is it not okay to ask: When she (let's call her XYZ) is feeling low or is getting off on smallest of things, don't automatically assume that it's because of her periods, maybe she is just pissed about something or having a bad day. Asking if she is “Down” or “Suffering from that time of the month” really makes her wanna punch you in the face.When she is sleeping more than usual or just eating mo

Short crispy answer &amp;#x21D2;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">⇒⇒\Rightarrow Depends on the situation.  Long answer- Yeah we make jokes on Facebook upon the statement, “You don't know what a woman is going through” , especially when this statement is extrapolated to justify every doing, right or wrong. But, in situations such as menstruation, sometimes we guys should admit that we really don't know what a woman goes through (plus in other situations too, but that's a separate discussion). Women go through major emotional upheavals when the periods set in, and in some cases, even before it (the term used in fancy as PMS). How? First, they enco

When I was in college,this friend of mine was to help me with an assignment and after following up with her for days, she finally agreed. We were best friends. Kinda shared everything with each other. And she knew me very well. She knew that I was just about to lose my cool because she was postponing it ever now and then when she had time to hangout with me. So she obliged. While going to her place later in the evening, we were having a good chat when I noticed that she was visibly uncomfortable. Later, I realised that she was just pretending as if she was listening to me but something was going 

Just after I got married, from last four days I was observing something different in my wife behavior and as it was our arrange marriage so I thought just talk to her about this I said - “Hey, madam is all ok” (I asked her) “Yaa” (she replied as not in the mood to answer) “Ooh please, you can share it with me” (trying to act little cute) “Nothing, by the way why did you ask?” (her Sherlock Holmes is active now) “Cause i know” (me with a big grin) “What ?” (she again with a Sherlock look) “That you are little unhappy or having some tension” (trying to hold her hand) “So what, why are you so worried”(sh 

She was looking exasperating farrago and completely distorted. I asked her, What happened ? You okay na .. ? She: Why ? Why are you asking … ? Does it really matter to you ? You are just busy in your own life. You don't love me anymore. You have no idea how I am feeling right now how much I am suffering you won't understand. The pain … Ahhh I am gonna die. And you know what, you don't give a shit because you don't love me anymore. Those are not her words she is just having mood swings. Me: Woah! Wait. What are you talking about? Now what I had done? She: See, you don't even know what you had done.  

Chemistry laboratory, pretty usual day. Thanks to the awkwardness &amp; stigma our education system has created in discussing chapters such as male &amp; female reproduction in schools openly, my concepts on menstruation were not “too clear”. But I had a rough idea that the cramps hurt. Badly! The lab session was to be done in groups of two. In the initial weeks of lab sessions my lab partner was a girl, quite intelligent, independent, curious &amp; always cheerful. That day was different though. Neither was she wearing the lab coat already nor was she smiling. The pain and uneasiness was clearly reflected on

NO WAY. We both were in same branch and she was good friend of mine.

We planned to attend CNTL lecture that day so i asked her Me - “its 1.30 nishi, we should go now” She- “i will not go with you, i will come alone” I was sure something is wrong with her I asked her Me- “Is there something i did or said ?

No it's not if you are not pointing it out as an issue. But I dare you not to mess with a girl on her periods. They are ticking bomb for those 5 days. And the only things which and diffuse the bomb is FOOD. The first day. She : WTF is wrong with this world. Why God why….?? Why only girls have to go through it. Me : it's okay don't be a cry baby…!! She : (death stare) what did you just say …?? Me : Rajma chawal?????? The second day. She : This sucks. Why I have to go to office every day, why can't I just live my life peacefully…We should get paid leaves for 5 days… agrrrrrrrrrrr…. Starts sobbing. Me : A 

Short answer: It depends on the context, just don't be stupid. Longer answer: If you are using her period as an excuse for her being in a bad mood and asking in a condescending or disdainful way I then yes, it is very rude. Assuming that she's on her period because she's had a crappy day is like assuming someone's dead because their asleep. It's just stupid. There's a 75% chance that you've just royally pissed her off, and lemme tell you bro, that's not doing anything for you. However, if you are asking because you genuinely want to help, then that's fine. In this instance, if your pretty sure sh 

Why do people know the risks of giving birth when they are older and still do it anyway?
I have a friend that has 2 high school age teenagers. She and her husband decided 4 years ago, when she was age 36 to have a couple more. Their teenagers were grown up, and they still wanted kiddos to love. So they had 2 more. The 4 year old is on the spectrum, but they just found that out. The youngest of the family is a baby boy. He is 2 years old and because mom was 40 and 2 months (approx) they did CVS testing. It came back showing that her baby had Down's Syndrome. There was NO DOUBT in their minds that they were going to continue the pregnancy. She told very few people, due to the judgmen 

There are many reasons why people get pregnant and give birth late in life. Perhaps they have struggled with infertility for years and have finally been blessed with a pregnancy. Maybe, after focusing on career for a number of years, they are deciding to start a family a bit later. They may want to be financially stable or perhaps financially independent before they bring kids into the picture. Or maybe Mr. Right never came along, so the woman decides to have a child via a sperm donor before her biological clock winds down completely. There are likely a myriad of other reasons that I have fail 

My mom was 36 when I was born. She felt society judging her for being too old to have a family. While she fretted over people learning her real age, I didn’t get it. Here’s what I loved about having an older mom. I was an only kid. Patience. My mom was extremely patient. We built an amazing bond and became inseparable by the time I was about ten. We had one argument in my 31 years she was In my life. One. Just one. And I have no idea how it started or why. I was home from university and flew back early to end the argument. She would have been 57 then. Maybe she was going through something and n

I always knew I wanted kids, the question was when. I didn’t get married until I was 34; I was in the middle of working on my doctorate while teaching and performing and thinking about having a kid at that time seemed like a bit too much on the plate. Plus we bought our first house and moved during the first year of marriage. The house was not conducive to having an infant crawl around or a toddler run around due to steep stairs, so that was another excuse to post-pone having a “family.” Life isn’t always so simple; and nor does it ever go as “planned.” Though friends and family told me if we w 

I was 40 when I had my one and only child. He was planned to the day. I had been testing my basal temperature for months and knew when I was fertile and I fell pregnant on the first try. I had a joyous pregnancy. No sickness, no mood swings. Some mild anaemia which was dealt with and some heartburn. He was breach until 2 weeks before being born. I felt him turn inside me like 2 bowling balls swapping place. THE WEIRDEST feeling ever!! He was 12 days overdue. I was enormous. On the day in question, I had been scheduled for a c-section due to his delay, but contractions started on the morning of th 

There are risks with every pregnancy, old, young, thin, overweight…whatever. People talk about “skyrocketing” risks of stillbirth after 40. Does my uterus really know it’s over 40? Is a few percentage increase *really* a skyrocket? People talk about reduction in fertility after 40. I didn’t experience that either. I had my first child at 33, my second at 37, my third at 41, and my fourth at 43. My second and fourth pregnancies and deliveries were my easiest. Both were term births. Both were unmedicated VBACs. When I got pregnant at 40 and 42, I’d looked at the statistics. I work for an analytic 

I am going to give you the benefit of the doubt since tone can be hard to distinguish online, but this reads as bizarrely judgmental. My first question back to you: why does it matter to you? What difference does it make in your life? I am three weeks away from my 40th birthday, and about six weeks away from giving birth to my second child. In my case, I got pregnant as an older mother because my husband and I both want two kids and we weren’t married until I was 34, so we started late. (I was already nearly 37 when my son — our first child — was born.) As others have noted, although the risks o 

Many people have their own reasons but I tell you something: better have them older that too young. When you are older you are mature and financially responsible enough to decide what's best for you and your kids. Usually you have more time because you are most likely better positioned financially. Not everyone age the same and I can tell you that I know MANY women and men of 40 and 50's in better shape than many at their 20's. My brother in law is a widow and had an older child with his first wife. After many years being a widow he met my sister and they got married. This was her first marria 

The risks are not as great as some people believe; and there are advantages and disadvantages of having babies at any specific age. I personally am the product of a almost 40 year old mother, and have had a baby at just short of 40, who himself and his wife had a baby at 37. Both my grandmother and mother-in-law had 11 children each, the last several of whom were born to mothers over 40. All of the babies in question are normal and healthy. My dad, who was 54 when I was born, thought that it was a good thing to be raising children when you were grown-up yourself. I was fortunate to have been a 

Golly. I’m just about to pop out my first child at 41. About a year before I got pregnant a doctor told me I was subfertile. It didn’t worry us - I was more trying to find out how close Menopause was to try to understand some health issues I was having. We’ve been married 10 years and not become pregnant (except once with fertility assistance but we lost the pregnancy early). Some months ago I decided to finally do something once and for all about my weight and food issues. I adopted a 12 step program with an eating plan and kept it up. I lost 14.5kg! I also forgot that weight loss increases fert 

What is the rudest thing someone said to you right after you had a baby?
plot twist i was the rude one… Long answer ahead… p.s for confidential purposes im switching the names. My father- Joe Stepmom- lily My mother passed and eventually my father got remarried, this lady was alright. I didnt hate her she just wasn't my mother, she was my father's wife and thats what I thought of her as, nothing more. They got married and by then I was 12, (side note- this lady is depressed and has panic attacks), anyways one day its just us, she takes me out to lunch and we are having a good time, while we are out she tells me its okay if I want to call her mom and she would like that  

When, three weeks after a partial placental abruption, I went to the hospital after some six hours of regular painful contractions, the female OBGYN (practice partner of the male OBGYN I had seen throughout my pregnancy and of whom I was a private patient) told me with a sneer that I was not in labour, although she did not examine me or even come into the room, but just stood in the doorway. Nevertheless she ordered that I was to stay in the hospital. There was a change of midwife, and the one that came on duty discovered that I was in fact in labour but did not bother to notify the OBGYN. I p 

Oh wow I’ve been waiting to answer one of these! And I have just the story for you all. I am a mother of 4 beautiful children, I know every parent says that, lol anyway my kids are 8(f), 7(f), 5(m) 4(m). My husband has a group of friends. They have been “boys” since they were kids. After high school they all still hung out and played pc and console comes online together- (still do to this day). I’m pregnant with our oldest son, they all would come over and spend time with the kids but due to busy schedules all couldn’t be around for about a month. In that month I had our son. Mind you this was  

Oh goodness, this is one I will never forget. My son was born by emergency C-section because he was trying to force out before I was fully dilated leading to stress. When he was born, he was brought to neo-natal for oxygen. Overall, he is fine, even today but when he was born, he had what my partner and I call “Boxer’s nose” he pushed down (or to say, my body tried to force him out) so hard it dented the top of his nose. Due to issues outside of the norm (my narcissistic mother) my partner and I got a DNA test done so to ensure she could not try and get my son if anything happened me, needless  

I found love a little late in life. At 37 I married the most wonderful man I’ve ever known. I’m white and he is Spanish, born in Mexico. After a horrific car accident in 2003 I was told there was little to no chance I would ever become pregnant. In 2008 I was being admitted to the hospital for a procedure related to a suspected heart defect I had been, unknowingly, living with. I was routinely checked for pregnancy and surprise, surprise I found out that indeed I was in fact pregnant! Miracles do happen! My excitement was beyond words. After a worrisome pregnancy due to my age, heart and after 

I was 18 when I got pregnant. The father wasnt in the picture during or shortly after the pregnancy, my mom was a little disappointed in me but she went through something like it before when she was 16 (only difference is I used protection when she did not and it failed). My dad was furious at me and to this day I still dont understand why. He would constantly talk down on me, get really drunk and call me a whore, slut, skank, etc. After I had my son it got worse, our mailbox was directly beside our front door and I would check the mail while having 1 foot in the door. My dad had already gotte 

The rudest and most insensitive someone has ever told me…. It was my Dad. I delivered a sleeping baby so she didn't help at all and after a crazy labor work I ended up ripped off, I had 5 stitches in between my legs…… Next day at night, one of my Dad's sisters decided to drop by (she knows we dont like her but since my Dad was visiting she decided to show off) she brought Chinese food, a dominoes table, music and dominoes… and the party started. My husband and I were EXHAUSTED so we stayed in the living room with them (we decided to play cards sitting in the sofa) but we participate on anything 

When my daughter was born we lived in a TINY mountain town. Our town only had one 3 way stop sign. That's it. The nearest hospital (and where my OB was located) was about a 25 minute drive through twisty mountain roads. The maternity ward had a grand total of 3 beds. My impatient little lady decided to come early. I'd been on bedrest for about a month at this point, and had already recieved a shot to boost her lung development as they were anticipating an early arrival. She was born looking perfectly healthy, but the small town doctor ( who by the way is, hands down, THE BEST, doctor I've ever  

My newborn baby’s grandmother asked me “Why didn’t you have an abortion?” as she was holding her new grandchild for the first time. I was 18 when I got pregnant. Even though I wasn’t raised Catholic, I did attend school in a Catholic system and in 12th grade we were shown that famous anti-abortion film “The Silent Scream”, which I have since found a rather disgusting thing for a teacher to do* (this film is nothing but propaganda and filled with lies). When I learned I was pregnant I kept thinking of what I saw in that movie and couldn’t have an abortion. I didn’t have a boyfriend. The father 

Pretty sure I've posted about my uncle before. But this is different. Wasn't said to me, but to my fiancé by someone really close to him. Skip to the second paragraph if you don't wanna hear the traumatic backstory and just get to what was said My daughter's birth wasn't easy. She was a week overdue, so we had to be induced. After 18 hours of being rolled around in my bed I finally started active labor. But she was a big baby with a big head like her daddy. 2 1/2 hours into active pushing and the nurses decide to have me stop pushing and just lay back. My contractions started getting worse and h 

My mother in law and I don't get along so I don't want her in the delivery room when I give birth. My husband feels that it isn't just my decision to make. Is he right?
My MIL and I don't really get along either. She wanted to be be around for the birth of my daughter, but when she was visiting in summer a month before giving birth, I made sure to tell her I only wanted my husband and MY mom there with me. She told me I shouldn't be dramatic and that giving birth isn't as bad as they say. She even convinced my husband that I shouldn't get an epidural and that contractions are not painful. She said she just laid in her bed and would check her watch occasionally and only got embarrassed when the doctor asked if a student could be present. Well, after 18 hours o 

My mother in law and I don't get along so I don't want her in the delivery room when I give birth. My husband feels that it isn't just my decision to make. Is he right? TL;DR: I’d recommend reading “Boundaries” by Drs. Cloud and Townsend — before Baby comes if at all possible. The audiobook is very worth it, and is excellently narrated, if that works better for you. Emotional Answer: I’ve offered to my husband that his mom is allowed in during delivery so long as he is willing to take a four hour shit in front of my mom and his mom, letting them comment about the features of the toilet and sanit 

I don’t think it’s fair that one person should be able to make unilateral decisions that affect the both of you; on any topic or activity. However, in this case, there is more weight behind your wishes. The both of you should be capable of discussing this like mature adults and come to an agreement that considers what’s at stake. I doubt that your husband’s desire to have his mother present is stronger than your desire to not have her watching you during a very personal and vulnerable time. I’m going to be a bit graphic here because it more accurately illustrates my point… you want to be able to 

It is your decision, and yours only, as to who you want in the delivery room with you. When my eldest grandchild was born, her mother invited me to be in the room through the labour, and said she wanted me there for the delivery. At the last moment, she then said she didn’t want me there, just wanted my son and her own mother there. I was disappointed, but I hid it from her and left the room, because, again, it was her decision, and hers only, who she wanted there. When my twin grandsons were born, their mother didn’t even bother to let me know she was in labour, or to tell me the boys had actua 

Your husband is absolutely wrong. Yes, it may be his baby, but YOU must be comfortable and feel safe while delivering it. Go with your gut feeling and let him know in no uncertain terms that delivering a baby is very tough on the mom, and anything that makes you tense or uncomfortable is bound to have a bad outcome. My MIL is a nice person and I generally get along with her, as long as it's not for more than an hour at a time. She is also fixated on taking pictures. With our first son, she asked and we allowed her into the delivery room. She occasionally made a nuisance of herself and annoyed th 

He is WRONG. It is 100% your decision to make. Whats more, you can also make the decision for HIM to not be in the room during the birth of your child. I'm sure that's not a decision you want to make, but it wouldn't hurt to remind him of that. As the patient, it is completely up to you to decide who you want in the delivery room with you. Yes, childbirth is amazing. Bringing a new life into the world is something to be excited and celebrate about. That said, it is also messy, embarrassing, painful, and leaves you in a position of complete vulnerability. By embarrassing I don't mean that you sh 

When I was born in 75 my father was not present. I had assumed he was at sea since he was in the navy but once in my 30s I was surprised to learn my mother didn't want him there for either my sister's birth or mine. My parents are both very ahead of their time regarding gender roles. My mother is a very forceful woman and my father is a guy who always helped around the house. I was surprised because it seemed so old fashioned. I said to my Mum, “surely the hospital was letting men in by then.” “Oh no,” she said. “I didn't want him there.” Mystified I asked why and my stunning and immaculately styl 

If you do not get along I cant imagine anything worse. When I had my first child it was like a party in my room even my sister was there it was amazing and all of the support was wonderful.There was laughter and tears and a true bonding of all the people in the room,it brought everyone closer for a time. When my daughter gave birth, I and the other grandma to be were both in the room. She was polite and tried to give my daughter privacy while she was being checked by nurses and doctors etc. She would turn her back or walk out into the hallway.This woman and I didnt really get along,no arguing o 

I have read most of these answers, and they are all spot on…. but… there is one more point that you should raise with your husband. (BTW, I think your husband is not only wrong, but kind of an idiot for turning your medical procedure into a way to make his mommy happy.) It could be potentially dangerous for both you and the baby to have a person that you don’t get along with in the room. If you and MIL have any kind of personality clash, it will take one of the most stressful situations that you are ever likely to experience, and pump it full of steroids. Stress is dangerous for both mother an 

I know there are already plenty of answers to this question, but I feel compelled to add my perspective as a certified Doula and student Nurse on a Nurse-Midwife track. Short answer: NO, he is not right. I am not negating the profound experience of becoming a father and the importance of paternal involvement, but his body is not on the line here. Giving birth will likely be one of the most significant and challenging events in your lifetime, and it is of UTMOST importance that as a laboring mother, you feel as safe, supported, and comfortable as possible. The individuals present during your la 

Is it legal to have an unregistered off-the-grid (no birth certificate) baby in the USA?
I was actually roommates with someone in College whose parents decided to have him “off-grid”. Let me just say this: Stop even entertaining the idea of having a baby off-grid. It really makes your child’s life unnecessarily hard and your kid will forever resent you for putting that pain on them. I’ll get into the details in a moment, but first let me address the question proposed above. Yes, technically speaking it is not a crime to have your baby off-the-grid in the U.S.A. However, a lot of details surrounding the event would be illegal. First of all, any licensed midwife or doctor is required 

I was born in the United States and I don’t have a birth certificate. When I was 21, my parents were able to obtain a “Certificate of Registration of Birth” for me. A county clerk of court issued it, based on a sworn statement by a great-aunt who was present at my birth, and on an insurance policy issued when I was two years old. Despite the lack of a birth certificate: - At age 16 I got a social security card. - At age 18 I registered for the draft (Selective Service). - Later that year I enlisted in the U.S. Army. - At age 20 I was issued a U.S. diplomatic passport. - At age 20 and beyon 

I don't know if it's legal or illegal. I was adopted when I was 2 in a church, deep southern part of Texas. I maybe was the only asian boy in that whole county. I'm 25 now but I can't get no ID or anything. As far as I know is that, was told by a psychic, my adopted mom was barren unable to have a child. And I was adopted some woman from Asia who couldn't afford to raise a baby. My adopted dad was working in an oil company and he got fired or just quit, I do not know. What I know was he was very upset with the govt policy towards middle east countries back in 90s. So he moved, before he met me,  

We did this. Five times in the US, two times abroad. To be clear, the first five births were unassisted pregnancies, unassisted births, at home, with no medical followups whatsoever. The children have never seen a pediatrician or a doctor. Eventually, we wanted to leave the U.S. and so we began the process of obtaining passports for all of our children. Needless to say our situation was unique, in that the children did not exist in any records (no school records, no baptismal records, nothing). Never once during the entire, lengthy process did any government agent insinuate that what we had done 

It is not illegal to have a baby and not file a birth certificate, unless you have it with a licensed midwife in my state. The licensed midwife is required by law to file a birth certificate. However, I would beg, beg you not to. The first two years are free game. You have about 2 years to file your birth certificate before some consequences start to occur. But even then, it can be difficult to file it after the fact. You will have to prove your child’s existence. If later in life, they or you get their birth certificate, for any reason, let’s say, they want to hold a job, get a driver’s license 

It's not illegal to HAVE the child as in giving birth; Mother Nature isn't going to delay delivery because she's waiting on paperwork, after all! The UN does have the provision, as many others have already stated and linked, that a child has a right to a name and nationality. I'm not sure about Federal (USA) or state laws. I believe those have also been covered elsewhere. My contribution here is two-fold. First, as a family historian, it is extremely difficult as it is to trace lineage with documentation available during different eras. For example, I am working with records from the 1800s in the 

It's obviously legal to have a child without registering its birth as the other answers have noted. There are laws which do require all births to be registered in a state. However, these are poorly enforced and, frankly, easily avoided if the birth occurs outside of a medical setting and without involving medical professionals. At worst, you'll be forced to register the birth and pay a small fine. Many people (alghough fewer thsn in times past) choose to ignore these laws. Here are a few scary "for instances" that may make you wish to reconsider this very poor idea: 1. Let's say your child wande 

State law will control. Each state will be different, but I would be surprised if they did not all have some sort of mandate. In Texas, here is the FAQ on the subject from the Texas Department of State Health Services Birth Registration Frequently Asked Questions It does not say what penalties might be assessed for failure to register in compliance with the regulation. I expect the reason the state would put forward to justify their insistence is that the consequences of being “off the grid” would be to the child, not the parent. In order to make social services or education available, the birth  

Both yes and kind of no. I talked to my attorney who has westlaw and is up late most of the time. Anyway he said at fist thought it is not illegal but also wants to point out. Westlaw is good but can not cover every issue. And he is not a family law expert. But he said he can find no law making it against the federal law. But. Here's some of the issues. I did some searching on the net. Some counties in some states consider it child neglect and or endangerment and or abuse etc.. the far left do not like home schooling. So they push hard on that one in some areas. Before reading about my brother  

Maybe you can find a way to have a baby “off the grid” legally. However, legal does not always mean moral or acceptable. If you are asking this question for any reason other than to satisfy a curiosity, then you need to rethink what you are doing, because intentionally avoiding registering the child and obtaining a birth certificate is child abuse, plain and simple. What benefit do you gain for your child by not getting a birth certificate? None. Whoever would do this usually has illegal intent. People avoid getting a birth certificate in order to: avoid child support obligations, avoid schooli 

Is there any evolutionary reason behind why child birth is painful?
Do babies forget their dad/mom after a period of separation having been with them since birth?
What is the most disturbing thing about childbirth that non-parents might not realize?
I had a normal home birth. At least, normal in my country. No aneasthesia, no inducing, no caesarean. In my own bedroom, with a midwife and her assistant and the lady who would be helping us around that week (standard in my country). My daughter announced her coming arrival around midnight on her due date, and was born just before sunrise at 6.12. Nothing scary, nothing out of the ordinary. She’s never again been so on time as for her birth. It was a normal birth. And it still hurt immensely. Because you don’t feel labor in your belly. It’s not a stomach cramp. You can feel labor pains in your l 

The most disturbing thing is how dangerous hospital birth really is and the lies that women are told and the horrific treatment they face but are brainwashed to believe is normal. The obstetrics community as a whole has done an extreme disservice to mothers. During pregnancy there is so much screening that is done, yet little is done to prevent potential complications. Diets are not taken seriously and warning signs are looked over early in pregnancy. This leads to women with all sorts of high risk problems when it's too late to prevent them. Medication is then given out like candy, which incr 

The way childbirth is represented in media. We’ve all seen it: The lady whose water breaks in a public place, and is rushed to the hospital like she has a bomb strapped to her that’s about to detonate at any minute. Once there, she screams and curses her head off until she’s holding a baby 8 seconds later. Meanwhile jokes are being made about squeezing a watermelon through a garden hose. What on earth? The worst part is, we are all told the same message over and over again: Birth is something we should fear. It is disturbing. Even I was surprised to discover that birth was nothing like this. Let m 

That you have very, very little control over how it goes and what happens. What sort of labour and delivery you have is almost totally dictated by things over which you have no control at all, including your uterine smooth muscles and the shape of your pelvis. Your baby's endocrine system decides when labour will start, not you. You don't have control over your oxytocin levels or prostaglandin levels, or how your uterus responds if labour is not progressing normally (it tends to respond by trying harder, which hurts more!) Another factor, partly dictated by the shape of your pelvis and how tig 

Everybody is mentioning all the icky stuff and the bad hospital treatment but how about this…the most disturbing thing for me was not having that immediate maternal, overwhelming feeling of love for the child I had carried for 9.5 months and then birthed. Everyone tells you you immediately love your baby. Well i didn't not love him, but i was more in love with having that alien removed from my body. I had a c- section, so possibly it was all the drugs. Once he was pulled out, I waited for that cry that says he's breathing and I guess he's ok? They cleaned him up and my mom filmed that part. And 

I think it’s that you don’t always know you’re in labor. I was told by countless mothers &amp; my doctor ““YOU WILL KNOW.” Well, I DIDN’T KNOW my water was leaking probably 24 hours before I attended a scheduled doctor’s appointment. In that 24 hours I went shopping with my then-husband and had to keep stopping from discomfort (that jerk kept walking, treating me like I was being dramatic even though I was due 17 days from then). We went out to eat and despite how hungry I felt, I couldn’t eat much. Over night I kept waking up from discomfort &amp; being grossly sweaty, rolling over 5–6 times every hou 

My 1st and most horrific childbirth was when I was 16 yrs old. My ultra sound revealed I was having a girl. I had a pretty uneventful pregnancy save for the road map of stretch marks that gorged my skin on my stomach, legs and breasts. Labour day started on April the 27th, my due date. I was so young and did not realize that the immense pain I felt was going to quadruple in intensity. My mother and I were sent home to labour through the night. By night 2 the pain was unbearable and yet again the prognosis was go home come back later. By the 3rd day I was in hysterics. I was not going home! No  

I’m twenty years old &amp; just recently gave birth to my babygirl Mila. Childbirth was horrific. I had to be induced at 37 weeks because of gestational hypertension &amp; severe edema. Most people don’t realize that when you’re induced sometimes it can take over 72 hours until you deliver. I was at my breaking point. I was already 3 cm dilated on my own naturally when I went into the hospital. Luckily, I was dilated enough that I didn’t need a balloon shoved up there to self dilate. All they would do for me is push pitocin through an IV at that point and see where it went. Well it was fucking going nowhere 

That after your child is born, you’ve passed the placenta and all initial weighing, testing, etc. is completed you’re basically left to fend for yourself and care for a newborn after having just completed what is probably the most physically strenuous task of your life. I mean sure, there’s blood, there’s goo, there’s damage to your ability to control when you pee, there are various pains and, if you’re anything like me, you’ll likely lose any sense of modesty as in the moment you just need to get through the contractions however you can. You might have something more serious happen! But honest 

Literally nothing. It's all a matter of being informed or not. You can have a totally easy childbirth and not know the pain others go through. You can have a miserable experience and not realize how systematically screwed you were by historical blasphemy of obgyn medicine. Did you really need all that pain lying down? Who knows? Certainly not the countless midwives who became midwives post birth because they got more informed afterwards about how awful western medicine is for birthing people. Post partum depression? Subjective. Plenty can “know" it and some might never know it despite similar si 

Does childbirth hurt for other animals?
Yes for the hyena[1] … It is true that among female primates human females are unique in risking death and injury each time they gave birth. The other great apes and primates don’t suffer from this, and I had not really read of other female species that die giving birth to their young. It seems that most other mammals give birth to much tinier tiny babies than humans relative to their body size; I don’t know this as I am just guessing. However, I think the hyena has the worst childbirth of any mammal.  The female hyena’s birth canal is V-shaped AND twice the usual length for a mammal her size, so t

No, it doesn’t hurt as much as it does for humans. The primary reason for that is the transition of human beings from a primarily quadruped species to the modern form of bipeds. The skeleton of our ancestors developed for millions of years to support a creature that walked on all fours. Now, when humans started discovering new uses of hands and benefits of walking upright, there was a problem. As the owners started benefitting from more industrious hands, evolution pushed its development further. The upright posture led to narrower hips with constricted birth canal. But wait, this was not the o 

Oh I can assure you it does. A friend of mine had an accidental litter of kittens two years ago and I was there when his cat gave birth. I still get shivers remembering her lamentations when she gave birth. It was surreal. I also breed gerbils, have been for 11 years now. And I can assure you they do suffer too. This is X. She’s a magnificent female who gave me two wonderful litters. This summer, I tried breeding her again but complications happened with the male, which ended up with her being on her own to deal with the pregnancy and the birth (usually, the male helps her out with the pups, the 

When we were back in Brazil, I experienced seeing a cow give birth. The cow was mooing softly, with so much pain and agony. That went on for about eight hours. Soon, the calf finally started making its way out, head first. My dad and others were there to hold the calf, guiding it steadily, as it made its way into its new world. The calf was able to stand on its own just minutes after coming into the world. She was such a darling, cute calf! The cow looked very exhausted after all that hard work of labour, but that surely didn't stop her from letting her calf drink some milk from her. When we we 

The Shingleback Skink, also known as the Stumpy-tailed Lizard, is an Australian lizard which gives live birth to 1-2 babies each year, about a 1/3 of their own size. That is the equivalent of a human being birthing a 7 year old child. These lizards fully develop inside their mothers and are almost fully independent at birth, giving them the best chance of survival. But that advantage comes at a cost. On average, the foetus takes up 35% of the mother's body weight. The mother lizard's abdomen cannot expand because rigid scales cover most of the body and CT scans reveal that a pregnant Shingleback’s 

Most animals do not have the pain we have when giving birth. I have helped and watched many different mammals give birth ( dogs, cats, cows, goats, horses,mice) that have no more than strong straining, I have only once heard a cry that I have thought was a cry of pain. This was the first litter of kittens for this cat. She strained and strained with the four kittens, but when she was birthing the fifth , she strained plus gave constant weak cries. After we helped her with the birth of the large dead kitten by removing it by grasping the hind feet , we found that it had a birth defect called cy 

The Gastric Brooding Frogs, an extinct species, gave birth through their mouth (weird enough).  After the external fertilization, the female would take the eggs/embroys in it's mouth and store them in it's stomach by swallowing it. It is believed that if a female lays 40 eggs, only half of them make it to the world alive. This would mean that the female fails to swallow all the eggs or digests some of the eggs.  The above image shows how a Gastric Brooding Frog gives birth. The eggs continue to develop into tadpoles while in the mother's stomach and it was also observed by the researchers that the  

So my amazing wife has delivered 3 kids naturally (10#, 10.5#, and 9.6# respectively). We also have kidded goats for 3 years and delivered puppies this spring as well. They all have similar paths on the progression of labor. None of them were screaming out in pain, but there were vocalizations (that are unique to second stage labor in my limited experience). All of them exhibited extreme focus throughout. You also have to remember that the massive endorphin rush after delivery and while nursing helps reduce the association of delivery with pain. In humans, crowning tends to be the most painful p 

Certainly, although humans likely have one of the most painful labor processes, due to our narrow birth canal compared with the huge size of our offspring.

What is the rudest thing someone said to you right after you had a baby?
plot twist i was the rude one… Long answer ahead… p.s for confidential purposes im switching the names. My father- Joe Stepmom- lily My mother passed and eventually my father got remarried, this lady was alright. I didnt hate her she just wasn't my mother, she was my father's wife and thats what I thought of her as, nothing more. They got married and by then I was 12, (side note- this lady is depressed and has panic attacks), anyways one day its just us, she takes me out to lunch and we are having a good time, while we are out she tells me its okay if I want to call her mom and she would like that  

When, three weeks after a partial placental abruption, I went to the hospital after some six hours of regular painful contractions, the female OBGYN (practice partner of the male OBGYN I had seen throughout my pregnancy and of whom I was a private patient) told me with a sneer that I was not in labour, although she did not examine me or even come into the room, but just stood in the doorway. Nevertheless she ordered that I was to stay in the hospital. There was a change of midwife, and the one that came on duty discovered that I was in fact in labour but did not bother to notify the OBGYN. I p 

Oh wow I’ve been waiting to answer one of these! And I have just the story for you all. I am a mother of 4 beautiful children, I know every parent says that, lol anyway my kids are 8(f), 7(f), 5(m) 4(m). My husband has a group of friends. They have been “boys” since they were kids. After high school they all still hung out and played pc and console comes online together- (still do to this day). I’m pregnant with our oldest son, they all would come over and spend time with the kids but due to busy schedules all couldn’t be around for about a month. In that month I had our son.

Oh goodness, this is one I will never forget. My son was born by emergency C-section because he was trying to force out before I was fully dilated leading to stress. When he was born, he was brought to neo-natal for oxygen.

Due to issues outside of the norm (my narcissistic mother) my partner and I got a DNA test done so to ensure she could not try and get my son if anything happened me, needless  

I found love a little late in life. At 37 I married the most wonderful man I’ve ever known. I’m white and he is Spanish, born in Mexico. After a horrific car accident in 2003 I was told there was little to no chance I would ever become pregnant. In 2008 I was being admitted to the hospital for a procedure related to a suspected heart defect I had been, unknowingly, living with. I was routinely checked for pregnancy and surprise, surprise I found out that indeed I was in fact pregnant! Miracles do happen! My excitement was beyond words.

My dad was furious at me and to this day I still dont understand why. He would constantly talk down on me, get really drunk and call me a whore, slut, skank, etc. After I had my son it got worse, our mailbox was directly beside our front door and I would check the mail while having 1 foot in the door.

The rudest and most insensitive someone has ever told me…. It was my Dad.

When my daughter was born we lived in a TINY mountain town. Our town only had one 3 way stop sign. That's it. The nearest hospital (and where my OB was located) was about a 25 minute drive through twisty mountain roads. The maternity ward had a grand total of 3 beds. My impatient little lady decided to come early. I'd been on bedrest for about a month at this point, and had already recieved a shot to boost her lung development as they were anticipating an early arrival.

My newborn baby’s grandmother asked me “Why didn’t you have an abortion?” as she was holding her new grandchild for the first time. I was 18 when I got pregnant. Even though I wasn’t raised Catholic, I did attend school in a Catholic system and in 12th grade we were shown that famous anti-abortion film “The Silent Scream”, which I have since found a rather disgusting thing for a teacher to do* (this film is nothing but propaganda and filled with lies). When I learned I was pregnant I kept thinking of what I saw in that movie and couldn’t have an abortion. I didn’t have a boyfriend. The father

Try to simulate what life might be like having a child. Try the following for at least 2–3 years and see how much you like it. -First give up going out and or having fun. -Try to see if you can get a job or at least work for someone else, try to at least get yourself working 80 hours a week, as this will simulate having a full-time job and the time it takes to take care of your kids. -get someone to wake you up at least 3–6 times a night, preferably in an uncomfortable fashion ( bucket of water, loud siren, loud crying sound etc.) -You have to wake up early everyday, try to get up at 6 am everyday 

I got pregnant when I was 13. I had my son when I was 14. I had another baby at 18. I was by no means wanting a child the first go around. At some point, right around the time I started puberty, I did want a baby. It was just baby fever and it passed. A year later, condom broke my first time and boom. Pregnant. I was mortified. I didn’t have sex again for years. At 14/15 you don’t have the means to care for a living, completely dependent human. You can’t drive, you can’t work.

Sweetheart, I agree with most of the other Quorans who are saying this is not a good idea. It will really affect your life prospects. You have talents and abilities that the world needs - and one day, when you are ready, you can bring a child into that world, once you have established yourself a little. A child deserves the love of both a mother and a father so that the baby grows up with all he or she needs to feel confident in life. Getting pregnant as teenager usually means that the Dad does not stay around. If you are not loved and appreciated at home, you may be looking for someone to love

What should I do? I am 12 weeks pregnant with twins, 1 of which is acardiac and growing just as fast as the pump twin. What is your advice?
Firstly, I am incredibly sorry that you have such a tragic situation going on. Secondly, I am mortified by some of the completely ignorant answers here. Any comments I make are intended to be frank, but I have great love in my heart for you in making them. The acardiac twin has ZERO chance of survival, which you know already. It has NO heart. That’s very, very sad, but a fact. The other twin MAY survive, but is likely to succumb to the extreme stress on its own heart. It is basically having to pump hard enough to feed itself plus a parasite. I don’t use that term lightly - something which is comp 

The answer to this question is in your own article that you cite. An acardiac twin has no chance of survival. The pump twin has ALMOST no chance of survival if the acardiac twin continues to grow at this rate. Radio frequency ablation of the connecting vessels will usually be indicated so the pump twin has a chance at survival because the heart of the pump twin will fail if it tries to provide blood to both itself and the acardiac twin. Most of the people answering this question don’t understand what an acardiac and a pump twin situation is. These are, in some ways, monochorionic twins that sha 

I am so sorry you are going through this. I know this will be a difficult decision, and while I don’t like abortions on developed babies, I also can see that if you don’t take action, you will most likely lose both babies, which would be extremely more sad. I agree that you should treat this as losing a child to stillbirth or miscarriage, for it is not something that can truly be avoided if TRAP is the case. Please see a specialist to speak about the best treatment and procedures if this is your decision. I decided to to research this because there’s not a lot of substantive information here for 

I am a surviving twin whose identical sister was acardiac. My mother knew she was having twins, but in 1966 they could only do X-rays. She says that I kicked, but my sister rolled. Oddly, as a child I had a recurring nightmare of being in a pink-brown world where an enormous THING was rolling toward me and was going to crush me, and I had no shelter but a tiny umbrella. We were early. I was due, my mother says, at the beginning of March. We were born on December 24. Even if we’d been due in mid-February, that is very early, and this was before the days of dexamethazone and betamethazone to help  

The acardiac fetus, severely malformed missing the upper part of the torso where the heart is located, and missing the head, has zero chance of surviving after birth, that is if the other twin doesn’t go into cardiac failure first - due to having to do all the pumping for the two of then - causing the loss of both twins. According to your link a 50% of death in utero.Thus all people preaching that you shouldn’t abort that acardiac twin don’t have any idea what they’re talking about, just the totally ignorant usual so called Pro-Life blah-blah.So discuss this matter with someone who knows wha 

First, I want to tell you how sorry I am that you are dealing with this decision. I cannot imagine being in your shoes. My advice is to first ask your OB-GYN what his/her thoughts are. At 12 weeks, the fetus is still relatively small and they may want to wait and see if it stops growing before risking abortion. Selective abortion is not a 100% assurance that the viable baby will survive — as sometimes it can trigger a miscarriage of the viable twin. Now, I am going to put on my ministry hat. I, personally, am pro-life. I don’t know where you stand on the issue and really, I don’t care either way 

As a mother, you have an obligation to save BOTH of your child en if at all possible. This is an unfortunate situation in which you might not be able to do so. Directly taking the life of the acardiac twin is a great injustice. So here is my advice, as someone who is 100% prolife from womb to tomb and who has seen firsthand the mental anguish of post abortive women. If the diagnosis is correct (and please get a second opinion because a couple in Ireland JUST aborted a baby for having trisomy 18 and it turned out to be wrong), you need to make sure that the pump twin is not lost. If saving the pump 

Whatever choice you make, my heart is breaking with yours. I’m so sorry this situation is yours to experience. Please do NOT seek advise from the Quora community or any other similar type platform. Find a support group which specifically handles your very unique and very difficult situation for the conversation and human touch you are desperately seeking. Also, speak with your OB/GYN and MFM specialist. They are no more excited or enthused by this diagnosis than you are and have the informative knowledge you’ll need to come to a decision. They will also, most likely, have the resources - or at l 

I want to state that I am a Muslim, and usually I would be compelled to be against abortion…unless there is no heartbeat. An acardiac fetus is not alive yet, without a heart. They have no heartbeat, no breathe of life, and no chance of survival unless a heart spontaneously grows out of nowhere. It will do nothing but pull vital resources and strain its successful twin, as well as pit unnecessary strain on you as the resources it drains are pulled into a big sack of improperly formed humanoid. From a religious point of view, you have your options open to you. You could choose to keep it in the ho 

That my love is going to be one of the hardest decisions of your life. It is okay to abort the acardiac twin to heighten your chances of saving the other. These things always have a risk of causing harm to both. Just know that whatever happens darling that you made the correct choice for you and that none of what happens is your fault. There will be guilt no matter what you decide hun. But the choice is ultimately yours. Do what you feel is best for YOUR life number one, and the life of your healthy baby. Best of luck and health to you all. 1K views · View upvotes18Jennifer GottfriedAnswered September 28, 2020 · Author has 963 answers and 541K answer views

I slept with my teacher and got pregnant. I’m 17. What should I do?
I'm Amanda from Jakarta, Indonesia. My answer is different from anyone. Bcoz I'm Indonesian, we're part of Asian so we hold different value than your country. Moreover I'm a doctor. In my country there's no pro-choice doctor. We all respect humankind ever since conception. So you can guess my answer: PLEASE DON'T resort to abortion  Yes, you can get rid of problem for now (you should know your baby is not a problem) but in the future many complications will arise fro abortion. From fibroid, cyst until uterine cancer. In short, your act of abortion today (due to wrong way of relationship) will p 

Comments have been turned back on. Discuss this topic like adults or I’m turning them off again. All of these answers don’t seem to read the question correctly. You willingly slept with your teacher and now you are pregnant. The answers given so far assume you are the victim. If you are 17 and you slept with him (as you say) you are old enough to know what the consequences of your actions could be. You need to take responsibility for your part in this. It takes two to tango. Let’s get one thing straight: Regardless of whether you love each other and whether or not you consented, what he did is stat 

Oh dear, this is frightening for you. Your teacher love and passion has taken hold of him the wrong way and to the wrong person. Some men don’t use their discretion and may not even be aware you are carrying his child. I think you should let him know what had happened, his reaction may be one of a confused mind and disbelief. Will he get the sack. Will he be struck off as a teacher, will his family and the laws come against him. Quite blankly that is his prerogative , he got you in this situation, why should you carry the burden alone, he should live by the school principle. They have rules he 

Hi there. While I don’t condone your actions of sleeping with your teacher, I can empathize with your situation. You see, when I was a teen I engaged in a lot of risky behavior. I did things that, when I look back on it now, I wish I had never done. When I was 17, I ended up pregnant as well, though the baby was my high school boyfriend’s, and not my teacher’s. Regardless of who fathered your pregnancy, you need to realize that by now your child is more than just a cell. At 8 weeks, your baby’s heart is beating and it has all the organs in place. It is very much a human being, it just needs nu 

I want to help you, so my first advice is disregard Megan whose comments are harsh, judgmental, pontificating, didactic, without compassion, and not at all helpful. All those thundering bold letters. Let’s lower the volume. It is ridiculous to tell a person what they should or should not know at any age, let alone 17. She doesn’t know you, your background, your circumstances, or the teacher. It is fatuous to say “you are old enough to know the consequences.” People of every age who know the consequences, make life-changing mistakes because they don’t understand the consequences, or themselves. 

Okay first of all you are not alone. When I was 17 my 24 year old teacher and I slept together. I never reported it to anyone. It happened twice. The principal suspected something and that was obvious to both of us. On an intellectual level I knew it was just sex and meant nothing to him. On an emotional level I day dreamed that maybe when we were older we could date. When I was twenty four I ran into him at a local pub where he was tending bar. We talked until the place closed and then he wanted to fool around right there in a booth. I said no way and high tailed it out of there! What a dirt ba 

Unless you have already told this teacher, dont!!! Desperate people sometimes resort to desperate acts. Stay away from him. Don’t share this information with any friends. Even best friends sometimes have loose lips. If you haven’t already seen a medical professional, please do so as soon as possible. That person, and/or a social worker with whom he or she puts you into contact, can help you to understand your options. If you do not know how to go about doing that, a school counselor (I’m assuming that the counselors at your school conduct themselves in a more professional manner than did the te 

At 17 hormones are just beginning to develop. But confusion about standards of relationships are not quite there for some people. Some people NEVER understand how to build a stable relationship. Faith groups are supposed to explain the “sexual impurity” issues in proper light. Many in the “white people” society of modern education system will blame the “teacher.” But people need to be realistic. Yes, by professional standards the teacher is a liar to his oath. But imagine if this was 1850. The teacher, if he is single and aged 24 would instead go and get married to such a 17 year old and be a h 

I’m looking at these responses and am baffled at how all the responsibility is taken from the young woman. Yes, the teacher did have a greater responsibility to keep it in his pants, but at 17, she knew exactly what she was doing. To say it isn’t her fault implies she was assaulted - but the sex was apparently consensual, as indicated in her question. When did we stop requiring women to face the consequences of their actions? She now has a duty to her child to ensure she has some form of support either during her pregnancy, or should she choose abortion. The father is duty-bound for that - amon 

Jerry Myers covered this well; I am in NYC, and the rules are the same. I am also a retired high school administrator. Do NOT tell the teacher! I don’t mean to frighten you unnecessarily, but a panicked man whose livelihood is jeopardized and whose family may leave him can lash out, without thinking, at the source of his personal armageddon. You may feel sure that would never happen, but did you really believe he’d sleep with you?Tell a trusted guidance counselor or teacher; alternatively, go right to the Principal.You may feel that you are as much or more to blame as he is. And you may have so

I got my girlfriend pregnant. Should I leave her since I am a student with two majors and don't have time for a job?
I will be blunt here. If you have time to maintain a relationship to the degree you had with your girlfriend that involved intimacy, then you have time for a job to help contribute to the innocent life you HELPED create. Speaking from personal experience of the abandoned, it would be morally irresponsible of you to deny your child. My son’s father rejected all responsibility for his son as soon as I told him I was pregnant. We were “married”. A relationship I learned much later was bigamous. I raised my son alone, with no assistance or contact from his father. At nine months pregnancy I was unab 

AT FIRST My instinctive response was to say yes, you should leave her, for her sake, because it doesn't sound like you are willing to assume any responsibility for your actions. It sounds like you are primarily concerned with what you might have to give up and are unwilling to give up, for example, some of your school activities or comforts, or taking on more work just for money’s sake and it will be difficult. Because of this, you might come across as rather self-centered and accustomed to putting your own needs first, which is not too promising in a young father. BUT THEN I remind myself, he 

Leaving your girlfriend won’t solve your financial problems, as you have a legal and moral obligation to provide for any offspring you helped create. You cannot be forced be to play an active role in the child’s life, and if you aren’t absolutely sure that you will remain in it, you ought to leave before the child is born. I’ll be blunt: Your comfort and happiness is not a priority in this situation, and you need to make your decisions based on what will benefit the child you’re about to have. Children who grow up without knowing a parent can have a hard time understanding why this person didn’ 

Solution: Stay with your girlfriend and child and work hard. From the way you write your question, I can see you don’t have strong feelings for your girlfriend. Otherwise, you wouldn’t ask yourself this. You can leave your girlfriend as a lover, but you cannot leave your child. It is your child, as it is hers, and your responsibility is obvious. You should help her get through the pregnancy and help raise the child. By leaving her, you can destroy her life. She will be alone with the baby and will not have time even for one major, while you are getting two! Also, she may never trust men again. I 

This topic clearly burst people emotions and I’m afraid there’s a big risk (or actually a fact) that you’ll be judged on the spot in the name of good ethical and moral, just for the seemingly idea behind your question. If you’re not judged by the situation itself, you’re judged by the fact you dared to ask such a question, and most of the answers and comments I’ve seen rush stoning you big time. Dam, we use to criticize that. Stoning people without fair trials. Or judging based on a wrong lecture of their words.

I really hope you take the time to read this. I hope it help you make a decision.I won't be a jerk like most people here blaming you for not using a condom, like it was your intention to get her pregnant. Which it obviously wasn't, but do be more careful next time... you know, condoms, or birth control because Pulling Out Does Not Work (that's stupid tbh). We've all had dreams and goals for our lives and I'm sure your girlfriend does too. This is your responsibility but you really need to talk to her about what you want to do. You have possibly 4 options: 1: have the child with her, 2: give  

Yes. Let me explain. If you're considering leaving her, you don't love her. In my opinion, staying with someone you don't love is wrong because it cheats both of you out of happiness. It teaches a child that a relationship can be loveless and for convenience. So yes, break up with her. I'm not sure why anyone thinks that people who don't love each other should stay together and magically force themselves to work it out. Everyone deserves love and happiness. A baby doesn't mean you're forced into marrying someone you don't want to be with, and it doesn't mean you're a bad person if you admit you don 

Dump your GF immediately! Take her back ONLY if you can address these points: Women have 100% control of not only their pregnancy, but of the entire birth process as well. While you, as a Male, have ZERO say in the matter (after your seed is released.) What I am telling you is that she is more likely than not: Trying to TRAP you because she wants your FUTURE monies. Follow these points, and if you (YOU, not her) are satisfied then consider keeping her and HER baby. (note: it is HER baby, not yours, as you have ZERO rights) FACT: If she just wanted to have sex with you because you’re just so damn s 

As Chelsea Meissner rightly says “It took two to tango here”: You are the father, your girl friend is the mother. To put Chelsea’s statement in to legal terminology “You are jointly and severally liable/responsible” for the conception of the infant. You say you are a Student with two Majors. Now, being English and not knowing the American Education System, please bear with me. When you say “Majors”, does that mean very high qualifications in two subjects, i.e. to Doctorate level, and that you have those through examination already? In the second part of the question, you then assert you are a study 

You have fathered a child. You are now a father. That is not a relationship between you and your girlfriend. That is you and your child. Your responsibility to care for your child has NOTHING to do with the status of your romantic relationship. Now, if you feel that the callous attitude in your question reflects much less than a sincere and loving devotion to your girlfriend, then maybe you shouldn’t stay together. Congratulations on discovering that at the worst possible time, but yeah, you have to be honest with her. If on the other hand you’re just scared, and you weren’t really thinking, it’s

My 14-year-old daughter admitted to me that she’s three months pregnant. What should I do?
I conceived my daughter when I was 14 years old (I am a male). The situation was a crazy one, the mother of my child was my 26yr old history teacher at school. She was not a paedophile in my eyes, it was actually me who instigated our sexual relationship, she was incredibly hot and very young for a teacher, she used to wear what most would consider inappropriate clothing for her position, and she was even disciplined on her clothing by the head of the school. Being a naughty little boy I was, she used to treat me different i.e. I always had a table reserved at the front of the class directly at 

My step-daughter was 15 when she got pregnant with my granddaughter. We were at the mall shopping and at lunch she looked over her Chinese food and said "I think i am pregnant." I didn't even flinch; I looked at her and said well let's take the test and if you are we will go from there. After a couple of pregnancy test, it was official she was pregnant. I told Samantha, that both her and her boyfriend would need to tell her dad. That, if they were mature enough to create the baby then they were mature enough to with stand what was coming next. Samantha told me first, because with children havin 

Wow! 14 years old is young. Nonetheless, what is done is done. Do not consider an abortion. Absolutely not. My mom became pregnant with me at 15 years old. She was a hippie in Southern California with a terrible upbringing who suppressed equally terrible memories thru drugs and sex. Lo and behold, she became pregnant, with me. My biological father bolted and nearly everyone in her sphere of influence advised her to abort me. My mom has made many mistakes but keeping me was not one of them.

To this day, I admire the mom of my junior high school best friend. We just graduated from Elementary and just starting to enjoy how it was at 13. While I enjoyed my teen going gaga over New Kids on the Block, my best friend was having an intimate relationship with a 22-year old guy. My best friend is pretty, smart and cheerful all the time. However, one day, she got pregnant, at 13! Her mom was a bank staff and her dad was a taxi driver, barely keeping up with life and their three daughters, my best friend being the eldest. She was asked to stop going to school but I continued to visit her in 

What to do idea: Collect materials and present a wide variety of options, suggest none of them - SERIOUSLY. Then have her make 3 columns with the top possibilities she will consider.

I got pregnant at 13. My parents were extremely upset, rightfully so (I was way too young to be pregnant). They screamed at me, hit me, threatened me and tried to force me to abort.

Well, when my 14-year-old got pregnant, she didn't tell me. Her sister did. My youngest was hiding from me. After I freaked out a little, I called her.

If one parent speaks to their baby in one language, and the other speaks to it in another, will the baby become bilingual or confused?
I taught elementary school in Casablanca, Morocco in the early 1980s. I always tell this story when people ask about confusing children with more than one language. I had a second grader who spoke 5 languages fluently (English, German, French, Berber and Arabic). Her mother was German and her father Moroccan (thus Arabic and French, for sure - possibly Berber as well). She had a Berber housekeeper. One day, as each language stood represented on the porch of the school, she spoke to each of us in the appropriate languages as she flipped from person to person without missing a beat. She learned  

This is a common conversation we have with our parent friends because we are expats. I should clarify, the ideal situation I have seen is when the parents natively speak different languages. (Not like learned it later in life) Most likely the language that their mother spoke, unless the parents spoke 2 languages. We are close friends with several parents who exclusively speak their native tongue to the kids, and they are different languages. One of our friends even had parents who spoke to him in different languages as a kid and chose the language to speak to his daughters by economic reasons.  

We have three boys (7, 4, and 18 months old). We speak three languages at home and an additional language in school. From experience, we've found that there is a “bad window" to introduce the fourth language if it wasn't already there at the beginning, but three languages from birth onwards is doable and not confusing to the children at all. We started already the day that the first child was born just like in the question: I speak my mother tongue to the children (Filipino) and my husband speaks Swiss German. There is no exception to this rule. My husband and I speak English with one another,  

As a linguist, I have been continuously fed up with the pat answer to this question, namely that children are sponges and learn any language they’re spoken to in. This is a simplification beyond belief based on a well-meaning egalitarianism. But anyone who is the slightest bit honest will realize that the matter is much more complicated. Really careful search of the carefully researched literature will reveal that nasty secret. First, what two languages? Are they Western European languages that are roughly cognate, or practically the same like Italian/Spanish/French/Catalan or Polish/Russian or  

When two parents speak two different languages consistently from birth the child definitely grows up speaking both the languages. I have seen this happening to my child. She is 3 and already speaking both the languages , efficiently switching between the two as and when required. Now that I find her strong in two languages I have introduced English into the mix. Anyways we used to read a lot of English story books since her birth, now I speak in that language as well but only during study hour. She understands almost everything in English, but prefers replying in her first learnt languages so f 

Not a parent here, but a daughter. My mother is Bulgarian, my father is Polish. My mum always spoke to me in Bulgarian, my dad always in Polish. Often, when dad told me something, mum would translate it, so I get a connection between them. I only ever mixed words (maybe till 6/7yo) when the word was topic-specific, like something I would never have the need to say in the other language. Thanks to that, I’m not only fluent in those two. I was also a very smart child and languages came to me very naturally. Now I’m fluent (C2/C1) in three (Polish, Bulgarian and English), intermediate in four (Slo 

My youngest has grown up in an American English speaking household, with me speaking Danish to her when we’re alone, and the result is a child whose language skills are developing ahead of schedule in both languages. My oldest daughter was already six years old when we adopted her, but by then I was already speaking Danish to her baby sister. I started to read her stories in Danish, showing her cartoons in Danish, and playing Danish children’s songs. It was amazing how quickly she caught on and became capable of understanding me, and at the age of nine she can converse with our Danish relatives 

My Colombian (Spanish speaking) friend married an Austrian (German speaking) friend. When the baby came, they consulted a linguistic specialist with this exact question. My friends were worried about language confusion. The answer: the mother should speak only to the baby in Spanish. The father should only speak to the baby in German. They should speak to each other in English. (English would be the language of parenting.). This will make the baby, if it’s a boy, about 8 months behind in English acquisition which will disappear by grade two. If the baby is a girl, there will be no lapse. They had 

I am father of twin girls, they are 6 years old now (in 2019). I live in Montreal, Canada and I speak English, Portuguese (mother language) and French. My wife speaks Portuguese and French. When the twins were born we decided that my wife would speak Portuguese with them, and I would speak English, and we would let them learn French in daycare. The first thing I noticed that that it took a bit longer for them to start speaking (somewhere between 6 months and 1 year) comparing to kids that were at daycare (same environment) and only learned one language at home. They pickup first English mainly bec 

It depends on if the parents are consistent about it and actually fluent at the language they are using. It is recommended that if the parents have different native languages, each will stick to using their own to communicate with the child and not try to use a second language. They can use a third language to communicate with their spouse if necessary. If it’s done consistently, the child will become bilingual. If not, there’s a chance that the child will not be fluent in any language and will keep mixing elements in a way that makes it harder for others to understand everything they say unle 

What is the rudest thing someone said to you right after you had a baby?
Is it fine to send my 12 year old to the park with my 2.5 year old twins while I stay at home with my newborn? She can take care of them fine, but do I have to worry about safety?
No. A twelve year old child is not old enough to do that. Too much can go wrong. Can you imagine if a terrible accident happened, that not only could one of your 2-year-olds be seriously harmed or worse, but imagine the mental damage it would do to the 12-year-old who felt guilt over an incident that she was not old enough to be responsible for? When my now 35-year-old daughter was about 11, we were shopping for shoes in Sears at the Mall. I asked her to keep an eye on her little brother who has Down Syndrome and was about 5 years old then. “Keeping an eye” meant following him around in the sho 

You’re missing a key point. I am the oldest of 5 siblings. As soon as I was old enough to, I was doing everything possible to help mom, including, yes, escorting toddler siblings (thankfully never twins) on adventures, babysitting, cooking, cleaning, teaching… this both colored my childhood and my sibling’s impressions of me. I got called “second mom” “bossy” “grandma” and, just to ice the cake, “(name)’s friend”. Nothing ever went wrong. I was an excellent child caregiver with a high level of responsibility and competence because I had no choice. My first jobs were babysitting. My first full tim 

I was babysitting at 12, so it can be done. My brother would not have been ready at 12. If your 12 yo is OK with it. If this is helping you and effectively your 12 yo is babysitting, maybe even think about a treat for your 12 yo such as letting them choose what’s for dinner an extra night. You know the maturity of your 12 yo. You know the distance to the park. You know whether they have to cross major highways, for example. (That would be a dealbreaker for me with a 2.5 yo). You can send your 12 yo with a phone. When we were kids, many of us played outside all day with parents nowhere to be foun 

Times have changed — for the worse, in this case. When I was a kid, in another century, children went outside to play. Their mommies did not hang over their shoulders every minute. I spent 10 years of my childhood in a oil company’s employee settlement, in a Middle Eastern country. It would be like living in a small town in this country. We roller skated, we bicycled, we walked to the movie theater, we played on the beach…all without any grownups staring at us. When we came back to the US, I was about 12; my parents settled in San Francisco. There was a playground set in the lawn around the apa 

My sister, who was about 15 at the time, took my six-year-old self and a few of my friends to the park. When it was time to leave, she couldn't find one of them. It was awful. We were all frantically calling this girl's name to no avail. No one else except for one mom and her son, who happened to be our age and in our grade at school, had come while we were there, and the mom and her boy were still there when we went to leave, so we had no idea where this girl went. This was before the days where teens had cell phones, so my sister told us that we had to RUN back to our house (a solid 15-minute  

Ask yourself first. Are you prepared for the possibility of all three of your children going missing? No? Thought not. Anything could happen out there. It doesn’t matter if she knows how to care for them. What if someone takes them? She won’t be able to fight them off or what if they have a seizure. Etc don’t allow this to happen absolutely Anything could happen outside of your home. If you need some time then I would advise getting a baby sitter who could take them out. No matter how responsible you think your child is don’t not let this happen. first of all she’s 12 not a nanny. If you need one  

No, it is not fine to send your daughter, to the park, with two toddlers. First, too many people are desparate to have a child, and a young child would be a great prize. A sick mind would even justify it: “I don't have any children. I'll just take one.” There are also people, who kidnap and sell babies. Maybe someone in a van will drive up, another guy will jump out the back, and both of your babies will disappear. And be sold to loving parents? Or raped and murdered? Or used in child pornography? I'm not trying to be a jerk, but these things are happening, more and more! Your twelve year old i 

In 1966, in Australia, a 9 year-old girl took her younger brother who was 6, and her younger sister who was 3 or 4 to the beach without anyone older in charge. Many people saw those children, all was well. In the 54 years since, no one has ever seen those children, and no one (other than those who were at cause) knows what happened to them. I tell you this not to scare you, but because it is alarmingly common that things go wrong. A young girl cannot chase 2 toddlers at the same time. Your 12 year old is a child, it’s too much responsibility to give her. Of course she will help you with things,  

No, it’s probably not okay to expect your 12 year old daughter to watch toddler twins that YOU and YOUR partner decided to bring into existence. Bad parents who reproduce over and over again always do this to the eldest female in the family (thanks to sexism and gender roles) - you expect HER to be the parent to all the kids that YOU decided to keep shitting out, despite the fact that you knew you wouldn’t be able to take care of that many kids. All this done while knowing and planning to have that bureden fall upon your oldest daughters, who you expect to become the mom of the younger ones. It 

If you live in the US don’t do this. Not because it’s dangerous or because your 12 year old isn’t old enough or responsible enough, but because you might actually get into legal trouble for doing this. A staggering number of parents have gotten in trouble with the law in the US for letting their kids out of their sight both within and outside of the home. Unfortunately many kids in the US have lost much of their independence and responsibility due to fear. For other countries the advice might be different. Where I live now, Germany, I wouldn’t hesitate to say it’s fine if your 12 year old takes 

Is it legal to have an unregistered off-the-grid (no birth certificate) baby in the USA?
I was actually roommates with someone in College whose parents decided to have him “off-grid”. Let me just say this: Stop even entertaining the idea of having a baby off-grid. It really makes your child’s life unnecessarily hard and your kid will forever resent you for putting that pain on them. I’ll get into the details in a moment, but first let me address the question proposed above. Yes, technically speaking it is not a crime to have your baby off-the-grid in the U.S.A. However, a lot of details surrounding the event would be illegal. First of all, any licensed midwife or doctor is required 

I was born in the United States and I don’t have a birth certificate. When I was 21, my parents were able to obtain a “Certificate of Registration of Birth” for me. A county clerk of court issued it, based on a sworn statement by a great-aunt who was present at my birth, and on an insurance policy issued when I was two years old. Despite the lack of a birth certificate: - At age 16 I got a social security card. - At age 18 I registered for the draft (Selective Service). - Later that year I enlisted in the U.S. Army. - At age 20 I was issued a U.S. diplomatic passport. - At age 20 and beyon 

I don't know if it's legal or illegal. I was adopted when I was 2 in a church, deep southern part of Texas. I maybe was the only asian boy in that whole county. I'm 25 now but I can't get no ID or anything. As far as I know is that, was told by a psychic, my adopted mom was barren unable to have a child. And I was adopted some woman from Asia who couldn't afford to raise a baby. My adopted dad was working in an oil company and he got fired or just quit, I do not know. What I know was he was very upset with the govt policy towards middle east countries back in 90s. So he moved, before he met me,  

We did this. Five times in the US, two times abroad. To be clear, the first five births were unassisted pregnancies, unassisted births, at home, with no medical followups whatsoever. The children have never seen a pediatrician or a doctor. Eventually, we wanted to leave the U.S. and so we began the process of obtaining passports for all of our children. Needless to say our situation was unique, in that the children did not exist in any records (no school records, no baptismal records, nothing). Never once during the entire, lengthy process did any government agent insinuate that what we had done 

It is not illegal to have a baby and not file a birth certificate, unless you have it with a licensed midwife in my state. The licensed midwife is required by law to file a birth certificate. However, I would beg, beg you not to. The first two years are free game. You have about 2 years to file your birth certificate before some consequences start to occur. But even then, it can be difficult to file it after the fact. You will have to prove your child’s existence. If later in life, they or you get their birth certificate, for any reason, let’s say, they want to hold a job, get a driver’s license 

It's not illegal to HAVE the child as in giving birth; Mother Nature isn't going to delay delivery because she's waiting on paperwork, after all! The UN does have the provision, as many others have already stated and linked, that a child has a right to a name and nationality. I'm not sure about Federal (USA) or state laws. I believe those have also been covered elsewhere. My contribution here is two-fold. First, as a family historian, it is extremely difficult as it is to trace lineage with documentation available during different eras. For example, I am working with records from the 1800s in the 

It's obviously legal to have a child without registering its birth as the other answers have noted. There are laws which do require all births to be registered in a state. However, these are poorly enforced and, frankly, easily avoided if the birth occurs outside of a medical setting and without involving medical professionals. At worst, you'll be forced to register the birth and pay a small fine. Many people (alghough fewer thsn in times past) choose to ignore these laws. Here are a few scary "for instances" that may make you wish to reconsider this very poor idea: 1. Let's say your child wande 

State law will control. Each state will be different, but I would be surprised if they did not all have some sort of mandate. In Texas, here is the FAQ on the subject from the Texas Department of State Health Services Birth Registration Frequently Asked Questions It does not say what penalties might be assessed for failure to register in compliance with the regulation. I expect the reason the state would put forward to justify their insistence is that the consequences of being “off the grid” would be to the child, not the parent. In order to make social services or education available, the birth  

Both yes and kind of no. I talked to my attorney who has westlaw and is up late most of the time. Anyway he said at fist thought it is not illegal but also wants to point out. Westlaw is good but can not cover every issue. And he is not a family law expert. But he said he can find no law making it against the federal law. But. Here's some of the issues. I did some searching on the net. Some counties in some states consider it child neglect and or endangerment and or abuse etc.. the far left do not like home schooling. So they push hard on that one in some areas. Before reading about my brother  

Maybe you can find a way to have a baby “off the grid” legally. However, legal does not always mean moral or acceptable. If you are asking this question for any reason other than to satisfy a curiosity, then you need to rethink what you are doing, because intentionally avoiding registering the child and obtaining a birth certificate is child abuse, plain and simple. What benefit do you gain for your child by not getting a birth certificate? None. Whoever would do this usually has illegal intent. People avoid getting a birth certificate in order to: avoid child support obligations, avoid schooli 

Why do babies have their fists clenched almost all the time?
Ah, a pediatrician getting to answer a question parents never ask. They never ask because we see it so commonly. It's just what babies do. I've thought about it, and I wonder if it's more important than we think. Could that simple question lead to a more important one? When I asked that question in medical school on nursery rounds, my professor's answer was "It's the palmar grasp reflex." Hey, I saw what you did; you just put a medical name on my question and repeated it. That's not an answer. I would never have said that. But I should have said, "OK, so why do newborns have the palmar grasp ref 

 Newborn babies are full of awkward and unusual  characteristics that may surprise you. Not only do newborns often have  wrinkled and purple fingers and toes, but they may also do peculiar  things with their hands, such as keeping them clenched tightly. Clenched  fists in newborns are normal, but if you are worried, talk to your  pediatrician. Newborn Position Through the first few weeks of life, newborn  babies often will retain the position they were in while confined inside  the uterus. They will keep their arms and legs close to their bodies  and keep their hands clenched. It will take week 

There are good answers here. I'm a father, and I probably can't answer such a long and detailed answer like people here, but I'll try to share what I can from my experience. I'm a father of triplets, all female. Two of them are identical, one of them is different. I can see that the identical twins usually have similar behavior to each other, while the third usually has different behavior. In regards to clenching fist, this also becomes my question, because they all had their palms usually open whe they're newborn, until they were two months. Beginning at three months, I started to see my third  

Partly is it just the way humans develop. Babies hands are still developing. They start out as mitten-like buds and then later the cells between the fingers die. It’s a complicated development process. Any baby in our evolutionary past that had more digital dexterity in the womb, may have had an increased chance of damaging those delicate hands during birth, leading to a harder time hunting/foraging, leading to a higher likelihood of death and an a lower probability of propagating those genes. Also, babies are born as blank slates. They don’t have any training or life experience. So they are bo 

As soon as baby is born, their environment is totally changed &amp; also the functioning of the body which was completely dependent on mother. They posses certain various actions like crying which is meant to get the sufficient amount of oxygen for the expansion of lungs. Likewise, they also posses various reflexes (involuntary actions to the known stimulus) which are called developmental reflexes and reactions. These reflexes and reactions are Primitive (spinal reflexes)Tonic (brain stem reflexes)Midbrain (cortical reflexes)Clenching of fist by the baby is also reflex but that is not everytime as y 

Nature's mysterious ways can be understood to some extent when we look at the different advantages of clenched fist of babies. Many scientific answers are provided by medical professionals which are insightful are appreciated by all. We also need to have a deeper understanding of nature's processes. We can try and recollect what is the position of our hands when we happen to stand for a long time while waiting for something. Naturally we stand in the akimbo position which is keeping our hand on waist. What is the advantage? Some think it supports the back. But actually when we stand with hands on 

Early childhood teachers perspective . The Palmer grip reflex in early months seems to be replaced by the pincer grip when food comes into play- about four to six months. ( babies would put things in their mouth that they should not eat if they had the pincer grip any earlier) . The sense of touch before then seems mostly important for breast feeding ie: drawing the Breast towards the mouth and bringing milk down by stimulation: ie . survival. The mere touch of a closed fist will do this, when the child is feeding well and relaxed the fist opens and increases the pleasure and effectiveness of br 

They just developed a nervous system with a steady growth series of excitation pulses, and unsurprisingly not been involved in any gravity exercise or other opening (or unclenching) stimulus in utero, then with birth (or successful preemie treatment) launched a neocortex which is going to mostly going to supress motor loop feedback (after 4 mos.) There is also launched a round of midbrain activation growth, but its balance of activation (and supression) of signals has not so far to go; it's going to dominate for 4 months (and the development pulses don't just drop out until the baby gets 5 hou 

It's a critical survival trait in primates. It allows the newborn to cling to its mother’s fur immediately after birth. Man is the ONLY primate that has primarily bare skin at birth, but we are still born with the grasp reflex going strong. Decades ago when I worked as an occupational therapist with The March of Dimes treating children with cerebral palsey, it was not uncommon to have to teach young patients how to “let go” of things. One of the physicians who would do teaching seminars for our therapy staff was Dr. Virginia Apgar, creator of the Apgar Scale that is used to assess newborns for  

A newborn's hands are clenched because of a reflex called the palmar grasp reflex. It is present in newborns and will be present until the baby is 5-6 months old. You can stroke an object, like a finger, in a newborn's palm to see the reflex. The baby will close his fingers and grasp the finger. This is called a palmar grasp.  A newborn's hands will be tightly clenched during his first month. If you pry open his hand, you can feel how strong a grip he has for someone so small. The baby can't hold objects for a while, but his hands are interesting to him and soon he'll realize they're actually a 

Why don't they make pregnant Barbie dolls?
My mother in law takes my baby out of my arms without asking my permission. She also passes my baby around to other people without my permission. How do I put a stop to this behavior without hurting her feelings?
Oh wow…well it’s pretty much up to you to set boundaries. By asking this question, it seems that this is not really a comfort zone for you. However you are now a mom, so strap up. Big girl panties on this one. People will do or treat you the way you ALLOW them too. This is your child first and foremost. I cannot remember a moment when someone took my son out of my hands when he was a baby without me allowing it. Maybe it was my RBF that threw them off, who knows. However my son is very socialized because I was the one that passed him along, allowing him to get comfortable with others. When my moth 

There are a lot of good answers here but one of them resonated with me more than the others and I thought I should tell you why. You are the child’s mother. No one else except the father (maybe) has any right to take the child from you or make decisions for him or her. This includes who gets to hold the baby. More, specifically, when dealing with parents and in-laws, they need to remember that they already raised their children and its your turn. I only came to realize this when my daughter was 10. I wish I had been told it sooner. My situation was different and over a long period of time. My in 

When my second son was born he was very jaundice. His bilirubin levels were fine only his skin and whites of his eyes were yellow and we were told to keep him in the sunshine. In February there aren't many sunny days in Ontario but his room would get afternoon sun right in his crib. And that's where I kept him. Plus, he was a good sleeper. This could be due to his jaundice, apparently, it makes them sleepy. So my SILs come to see the baby. One of them didn't want a family of her own and she concentrated on her career instead. She only loved her nephews while they were babies and toddlers, as i 

While many things connected with your baby will require your “permission”, this probably isn't one of them. Your mother-in-law is from a different generation. She — obviously — loves her grandbaby and wants to share her grandbaby (and her love) with those around her. Unless the baby was a premature birth, or special needs infant, permission isn't required, and allowing Grandmother to share the baby establishes the following: Tolerance — Even if your mother-in-law is the wicked witch of the east, she deserves to have access to the baby. Holding the baby creates a bond, and feel-good chemicals inc

I find that often when people do things that make us uncomfortable it is because we have never communicated to them that it does. I agree with what someone said, that you are allowing your MIL to take your child from your arms, I doubt she is yanking him from you. MY advice is to tell them in no uncertain terms. She might think it harsh at first but will realize it in time. Tell her nicely, “It makes me uncomfortable when you take the baby without asking. I love that you want to spend time with the baby, I don’t mind, but if you could ask me before you do take him/her. I also don’t quite like h 

I had a similar situation, with my MIL. I was a new mother, with no mother of my own. My MIL took me under her wing, and was very good to me. Being I worked nights, on the weekends, and my husband was off on Wednesday’s and Thursday’s, my son would go to gramma’s on the weekends. Now when everyone was at my in-laws house (for a holiday or whatever), I noticed my MIL took over the parental responsibility of my son, even though I was there. I didn’t like this. I didn’t let my son have soda, or a lot of sweets and things like that. Yet my MIL would give in to him. I also noticed his behavior wasn’t  

You’re going to need to set up boundaries and people who have none, like your MIL, is not going to take them very well so you’re going to hurt her no matter what BUT you can still do it in a kind and loving manner. You should never allow someone to disrespect you out of fear of being undermined or have any mistakes tossed in your face, or anyone pressuring you that she should be able to do whatever she wants as the a grandmother. That’s the key word, GRANDmother, she’s NOT the mother, YOU ARE. If there is an issue with the MIL that becomes deeper, your husband should be backing you and the tru 

It took the St Judes Childrens hospital a month to release my firstborn to me back in 1975. On the way home, my stepmother was anxious to take him from my arms. But something happened to me, my heart started pounding, I became terrified that if she got her hands on him- I would never get him back. I felt sick and like getting out of the car and running away! I said NO! Later, I heard this hurt her feelings. But I promise you I didnt choose for the word NO to come out of my mouth it just happened…and I felt like a lioness roaring as I said it. I really couldnt help it. I grew up never having anyth 

Okaayyy, the most popular answers are basically telling you to communicate with her like she’s a lap dog. As much as we’d all like to put MIL’s in that place, wagging hands and fingers is not appropriate to do toward an adult female, especially not one who has control issues. The polite thing to do would be to let her know over coffee or tea or a quiet, private setting, that you want to respect her and will need her to ask for the baby and then take her if you agree. Tell her you know she would want the same respect and you appreciate her excitement to help yet you need a change moving forward.  

Are you kidding me? When I had my first (and only) kid, I was THRILLED to have him passed around to everyone in the room. I was free for a few moments to eat, drink, or godforbid, pee. I knew I’d get him back when it was time for a diaper change or he got cranky for “food.” Of course, my MIL had passed before I married her son, and my family members were just trying to get to know their youngest grandson/nephew/cousin and would not have argued if I’d asked for him back. There was one time when I attended a baby shower with my son when he was only about a month old. One “grandmother” asked to ho 

How do you discipline a baby?
I never 👎🏾 liked the words, ‘No’, ‘Don’t’, ‘Stop’, ‘Quit’, ‘Hush’, or a few other negative words experienced as a child. With the gift of reading, something inspired my sister and I to seek out a different way to help the next generation, should we be blessed with having children. At 40, new friends came into my life and ten months later, they welcomed a baby girl. At twenty minutes old, we met and I made a vow to be in her life. Over the next year, the honor of watching her while her parents worked was split between her grandmother and I. During our time together, she heard me speak in com 

My first pregnancy, I had twins. One cried all the time. The pediatrician at first thought he had a sensitive stomach. I ended up using a special formula, but the baby still cried all the time. Maybe it was colic? One day, I noticed that when the baby was laying in a certain way, he always cried. But if I rolled the baby the other way, he was able to settle down. The doctor checked him over and noticed that one side of his neck was “tight". After discussing it, we realized this baby had torticollis. I brought the baby, now about 6 months old, to a chiropractor who taught me several techniques to 

You don't. I assume you're referring to babies who are ambulatory (i.e., crawling, climbing, and/or walking) up through toddlers, basically from the age that they are able to start exploring and getting into stuff. It is the parent/caregiver's job to give the baby a safe place to explore, and provide supervision. If a baby is consistently getting into things they shouldn't or ending up in unsafe situations, it's the parent's fault, not the baby's. At that stage of development, exploring, making messes, and putting things into their mouths, etc., is all part of how they learn. If you want them t 

The origin of the word “discipline” is the Latin word for “teach.” The word “disciple” comes from the same place. In that sense, every interaction with a baby, even a newborn, is a disciplinary action, because they are sensitive, and learning all the time. It’s important to be aware of what your actions are communicating to a baby, because you can’t help the fact that everything is disciplinary. Do you pick the baby up every time he cries, or do you sometimes leave him to cry, as long as you are certain he is fed, dry, and safe?

I'm not sure what a baby would do that they needed to be disciplined..But as a mother of 2 children under the age of 3, I understand how you'd need to stop and correct a bad behavior for example “biting, scratching, hitting, pushing, throwing" these are all things that small children do because they aren't sure what to do when they feel a certain way. I'm no expert and I'm doing the best I can for my girls, but when something like this happens more with my 1 year old then my 3 year old, I like to stop and distract with something else, and as she (my one year old) seems to understand almost eve 

The on-line dictionary defines “discipline” as “The practice of training people to obey rules or codes of behaviour, using punishment to correct disobedience”. This definition is bullshit, and results in many people incorrectly confusing the concepts of discipline and punishment. They are not the same. The second half of the dictionary definition may well reflect how many people think that “discipline” works, but it’s wrong. To “discipline” certainly means to provide training…but does not have to involve punishment in order to be effective. The best way to “discipline” anybody - child or adult - 

To “discipline” is to create a disciple, one who willingly and respectfully honors and follows instruction in order to become LIKE their “master.” With this correct definition of “discipline,” I will answer this most important question. Discipline Most Appropriately BEGINS in infancy. Infancy is when a human is most tender and capable of being “discipled.” A needy, impressionable and helpless child looks for life, sustenance and nurturing from the source available… hopefully a wise and capable caregiver. It is precisely now, when the child is most helpless to acquire its own needs, that correct 

My first question is, how old of a child? Many of these answers act as though a 24–36 month child can not understand cause and effect. I strongly disagree. If a 6 month old can be taught sign language, then a six month old can comprehend cause and effect. If you are talking about a child birth to 12 months I would say that the term discipline should not be used. If a 11 month old is in their crib feb, clothed, and has a clean diaper and still crying, then the child is emotionally fine and can whimper for a short while to fall asleep and you are not a bad parent. If you have a problem with dail 

There is nothing to warrant discipline of a baby, at any time. The reason babies cry is because it is their only way to communicate their needs, both physical and emotional. You may feel that you've covered all the bases…feeding, diaper change, gas drops, fever check, teething, etc… but if your baby continues on it is bc a problem still exists. Maybe the tummy ache persists despite gas drops, or the diaper change didn't help bc the discomfort of an infection. Maybe you don't realize they are teething at this specific time, or the prior efforts didn't provide relief, or acid reflux is causing disco 

Ephraim Bulka, please define “baby.” If the baby is between the ages of one and two, she probably doesn’t understand the difference between right and wrong but knows what “No” means. You can “discipline” her at that age by picking her up and moving her away from whatever danger she could be in, or to save the priceless collection of Belleek dinnerware you’ve positioned near her toybox. If she’s under the age of one, she probably doesn’t understand the word “No.” I suppose, to teach her what it means, you’d need to break out the baby-whip and force her, through the administration of pain, to lear 

Why do doctors sometimes say “We can only save one of them” when in a mother-child situation?
I am Catholic, so I am one of those nasty pro-lifers that supposedly hates women and thinks fetuses have more rights in the emergency room. /sarcasm. Anyway, I have worked in health before as a fertility awareness instructor, and am currently preparing for midwifery school. I also follow/am friends with Catholic health care workers (mostly doctors) as well as some other pro-life doctors who are not Catholic. Therefore, our medical outreach involves treating both mother and baby (born or unborn) as equals. Here is what their decades of experience plus my own several years of research have shown  

My understanding of this phrase is from a very old family story told to a teenage me. I think they were trying to scare me about ending up pregnant. The short version of the story is about my grandmother's younger sibling who would have been a twin. This was a long time ago, early 1900's. They lived on a farm in the middle of nowhere, no doctor close, no hospital, and taboos about men being there for the birth process. My grandmother and all of her siblings were born at home either unattended or with only a lay midwife (practice catching babies, not much medical training, if any). It wasn't a s 

We don’t—not ever. I have been involved—several times—in situations of this kind: where the mother was so sick that we truly feared she would not survive. The ethics of the situation are crystal clear. We all know them. And the law in my country supports us unequivocally. In all circumstances our priority is to save the mother. The baby has no rights as an individual under law until the cord has been cut. I have once, very calmly, steeled myself for the situation where I would deliberately take no action if the baby showed distress, because if I did something dramatic, like they do on TV, I could 

The doctor said that to my husband: “We can’t save them both, which one do you want us to save?” Stunned, scared and speechless, he finally mumbled: “Save my wife. We can have another baby.” I was too sick and didn’t have a choice. I would have chosen life for my baby. I had pre-eclampsia. I was exhausted from induced labor and excessive pushing without any results. My blood pressure was stroke level. I was very edematous and swollen. I was being supplemented with an oxygen mask. My baby and I were both in distress. My baby’s heart rate dropped dangerously low. They decided on an emergency C-secti 

Interestingly, I was recently chatting with my gynecologist about this, who is a VERY talkative lady. She told me, that this never happens, that doctors ask the family: “we can only save one of them. You must choose, mom or baby.” She said, that in her 2 decades of practice, she had never seen this situation. According to her, in most circumstances, if they can't save the mom, the baby will die too, so prioritizing mom is obvious. Secondly, she said, that according to medical ethics, it's obvious that saving the mom is the right choice. Thirdly, why should they traumatize the family, (usually  

As being daughter to a gynaecologist. Yes there are times that type crusial situation comes. Very rare cases that gynaecologist team need to choose either one of them. But they always try to save both of them. But in some complicated cases they have to choose. That is not easy for any kind of medical staff. But if something like that need to be faced, then other family members will be notified ,discussed their opinions counted. That is how it happened in EU. For the 30 years time of my mother's gynaecologist life that happened only once I was 17 and that day my mother was so upset. They had ch 

Well you’re wrong. I doubt if doctors *ever* say that, in the present day. They *may* think it, but that would be a dreadful thing to say. They say: “We’re going to do everything possible.” Now, 100 years ago, when a baby was stuck in the birth canal, and the mother was dying of exhaustion after 3 days of labor. Yeah, they might have said that. But modern medicine has made it unlikely that a doctor and laboring woman and family member are ever going to have a discussion that begins with: We can only save one of them which —one should we save? There may *be* such situations, but I sincerely doubt 

April 2006, I was in the hospital with FULL BLOWN ECLAMPSIA. This was my second child, btw. The doctors sent me for a fetal assessment (Saturday) to see how my daughter was faring. So far, she was okay. After the scan (keep in mind I didn’t know the gender yet), the head obstruction came up to me and told me that SHE would be born soon. That it was no longer a matter of carrying HER to term but that I would be delivering in the next two weeks. I told him straight to his face: ““I don’t give a DAMN about your ethics. If it comes down to me or my daughter: YOU SAVE HER LIFE. Don’t worry about me 

They don't. Many many times they save both. What the discussion is about is the times when you have to choose. Birth is still dangerous for both mother and child. Even with all we know. Things like Eclampsia, where the mother's body reacts poorly to being pregnant. The cure is to deliver the baby, if possible, so both can live. If it is bad enough the baby has to be aborted so they both don't die. An ectopic pregnancy is death for both unless the baby is taken (with the tube) so mom can live, there is currently no way to save the baby. A separating placenta is going to kill both unless baby is 

It's a common dramatic device for TV and movies. In a hospital setting, there are generally enough people in the delivery room to care for both. Some will take over the infant's the minute it's delivered, while the others care for the mother. As mentioned in another answer, if the mother faced imminent demise, they're at high risk of losing the infant as well, so if course they're going to try to save to the mother, and possibly the baby, too. In a situation so dire that they need an immediate decision, an MD isn't going to leave the patient and run out to speak with the family. The only way I ca 

When infants are adopted before they are even a year old, wouldn't they notice that the people adopting them aren't their biological parents?
That’s not how it works. They don’t care. The need for individual attention, love and care are much more important that genetics. We have eight adopted. Five never knew their biological parents. Three were older when they came into the orphanage system, and remembered their parents. None of those 3 missed them as they were all alcoholics and very negligent. One, adopted at 13 romanticized the orphanage and the country. I took her back when we adopted the next two. I knew after becoming used to being a pampered American she would feel differently about things, and she needed to work it out in h 

Not even a little bit. My son came to me at eight days old. My husband and I were young foster parents (then 22 and 23, now 25 and 26). His biological mother is developmentally disabled (around the age of 10 mentally) and has multiple mental health diagnoses. Let’s call her Lily (not her real name). Lily was living in a facility for recovery addicts and the mentally ill when my son was born. The hospital monitored her from the beginning, when she shook him in the hospital. When she took him to the care facility, it was staff that made sure he was fed. When CYS (Children and Youth Services) visi 

Yes! (For those that have already answered no, please hear me out.) I say this as a proponent of adoption and an adoptive father, myself. I grew up with an adopted cousin who was my best friend in the world until his death when I was 10. I don't remember ever NOT knowing he was adopted, and it never made any difference to anyone in the family, as far as I knew. I thought it was always that way in good adoptive families. Then I became a therapist and worked with a number of adoptees. Many of them felt out of place in their adoptive homes, some of whom were adopted at birth and had very good, lovi 

My son was 5 days old when he came to live with me. In that time, he had undergone birth and separation from all he had known: her voice, her body’s rhythms -- everything he had experienced until then. She never held him or nursed him. He was born at 4:30 a.m. and she left the hospital, having signed papers for the adoption agency she selected, by noon. Then he had other caretakers - nurses on duty, people who volunteer to rock babies, etc. And the last night he spent away from the hospital, whose rhythms he had come to accept as normal, with a foster parent. She brought him to the agency the  

I am the parent of 2 adopted children. Both had been abandoned. One came to us at 8 months and was happy and cheery all the time. She had been in an orphanage. She put herself to sleep after playing in her crib at night for a while. Then in the morning, she would play in her crib until after an hour or so, she would cry, being hungry. We thought this was the best baby ever (she was our first). Then our first child by birth arrived. Oh my! Things were definitely different! We started to realize that our first baby had been unattended for much of the time in the orphanage. She played while in th 

Not one bit! My wife and I are Caucasian American. I have darker hair with a fairly tanned complexion, my wife is Blonde, light complected , and we have blue and green eyes. Our daughter is the youngest child ever to be adopted from the Indian National Adoption program (India the country) into the United States, we were blessed to get her at a young age due to a sad situation for both her part and ours, and with help from the National Director of Indian Adoptions, she was home with us in the States at a little over five months old. She was malnourished, but beautiful! She had beautiful brown sk 

This is really interesting. I’m not adopted, but I was put into emergency shelter at an age of 6 months, and then put into a foster care family at around 1 year old. The family consisted of my two caucasian parents and their adopted daughter from Brazil who was 8 at the time (I consider her my 100% sister, cause we grew up together and still live together to this day). My parents (Foster, I call them my parents) were always straight up with me, they always told me what they knew about my story (in a child friendly way in the start) but even now, at 18, I haven’t even figured half my story out - 

We adopted two boys at birth. One was Black American, the other was Native American. We never kept it from them that they were adopted, but it was hard for them to comprehend what that actually meant. For years when getting out of our nightly bath together, we would sit in front of the bathroom mirror and they would look at the three of us, and say things like, “it’s unbelievable how much we look a like.” They couldn’t see the difference between themselves or myself. I’m Caucasian. It wasn’t until the older boy came home one day from the 2nd grade, that he was upset, because one of his classma 

My parents took me in when I was, I believe, 4 months old. I didn’t have a clue, and didn’t even care when I was told at perhaps 6–8 years old that I was special. I don’t have an incredibly amazing story to tell as it was a closed adoption. I’m the one out of the kids who nobody has any backstory about. Interestingly though, while I’m a bit of a daddy’s girl, I’m also very much the black sheep of the family. I consider my parents to be my parents, I raise an eyebrow if someone mentions biology - they’re my parents, I don’t need anyone adding adoptive or anything before it. And don’t ask me if  

Yes, newborn babies know the sound and smell of their birth mothers even if they didn’t spend any time with them following birth. The theory is that the separation between newborns/infants and their birth mother cause trauma that is internalized by the child who does not know how to process the separation. It’s best if a relative, foster parent or adoptive parent can immediately step in and create a bond with the child by meeting the child’s needs with skin to skin contact, love and attention. This doesn’t neutralize the trauma, but it does help. I was lucky enough to be in the delivery room wh

How did China increase its population by forcing Uyghur people to have birth control and genocide at the same time?
What were women’s lives like before birth control?
To answer this question correctly we might need to separately consider the two ages: the age before agriculture evolution, and the age after agriculture has changed everything we had already gotten used to in a hunter-gather life style. Before agricultural evolution, the physiology of women were subject to harsh regulations of nature. Prehistoric women in hunter-gather tribes had fewer periods overall because with a high level of daily physical activities, together with long period of lactation, which lead to both fewer periods and longer intervals of birth for hunter-gather women, compared wit 

My grandmother was 13 when she got married in 1912, he was 26. After 5 miscarriages in just 3 years, she realized her body wasn’t ready for children yet, so she used the only effective birth control available to her at the time - she put a padlock on the bedroom door. When she was 19, she felt her body was ready. She had eight live births, and several more miscarriages. Three of her babies died before the age of 5. After her twins were born, when she was 26, she felt she had done her duty as a wife, and the padlock went back on the door. That was in 1925. During the first World War (1914 - 18) s

Ironically, I have heard from her that people who only had ‘one’ child, are often questioned, ‘do you have any health problem? why are you not conceivi 

My Kenyan grandmother had 10 children who lived, who knows how many miscarriages happened. She had a child every 2 years. Let’s make some assumptions. If she delivered her first child at 18: Age 19 she was breastfeeding the 1st kid Age 20 she was pregnant with the 2nd and delivered Age 21 she was breastfeeding the 2nd Age 22 she was pregnant with the 3rd and delivered Age 23 she was breastfeeding the 3rd Age 24 she was pregnant with the 4th and delivered Age 25 She was breastfeeding the 4th. At age 25 she’d have 4 kids and would most likely be pregnant with her 5th. She continued this pattern till age  

What were women’s lives like before birth control?
To answer this question correctly we might need to separately consider the two ages: the age before agriculture evolution, and the age after agriculture has changed everything we had already gotten used to in a hunter-gather life style. Before agricultural evolution, the physiology of women were subject to harsh regulations of nature. Prehistoric women in hunter-gather tribes had fewer periods overall because with a high level of daily physical activities, together with long period of lactation, which lead to both fewer periods and longer intervals of birth for hunter-gather women, compared wit 

My grandmother was 13 when she got married in 1912, he was 26. After 5 miscarriages in just 3 years, she realized her body wasn’t ready for children yet, so she used the only effective birth control available to her at the time - she put a padlock on the bedroom door. When she was 19, she felt her body was ready. She had eight live births, and several more miscarriages. Three of her babies died before the age of 5. After her twins were born, when she was 26, she felt she had done her duty as a wife, and the padlock went back on the door. That was in 1925. During the first World War (1914 - 18) s 

All of the answers here so far claim that the sexually unfettered, lust drenched societies that modern birth control has produced are just great and that life was almost unbearable before this very recent discovery. Such talk coming from a teenage mind would not surprise me in the least, but it is sign of how prophetic Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World” was that we are now hearing this from everyone, including a 75 year old in this thread who is really happy that we can now have lots of sex with lots of different people without having to worry about the consequences. In truth there are lots of n 

Birth control didn't only affect the life of women, also the lives of their children in a very positive way. My grand-grandmother had only one child. She had married a man that had been a socialist and later a communist militant in the pre-fascist Italy, and a trade Union leader in his region. He had barely finished thrid grade before being sent to work the fields and she owed her literacy to a priest relative that had tutored her privately for free. Once married they decided to have one child only. They believed that people did not have the right to have children they could not afford to raise 

 When the Pill was approved by the FDA in 1960 for contraceptive use, millions of women over the next years were freed of educational, economic and employment restrictions that were encountered as a parent. It also enabled women to separate their sexuality from childbearing. The Sexual Revolution was born. Abortions used as a means of contraception dropped. Eventually abortion was tackled in the courts. I was born before the Pill was developed for public use. By the time I was sexually active, the Pill had been available for only a year. Having the Pill available enabled me to continue my educat 

Moving to another room was what my Great Grandmother did after she gave birth to her ninth child (my grandmother). OTOH, my Grandmother married a widower with two children. They had one child together, my Dad, in 1938. Then WWII came. Grandpa joined the Navy and Grandma was left mostly alone. Her Father was still alive and living with them. After a shore leave, Grandma found out she was pregnant. She didn’t think that she could take care of another child in the situation. She arranged for a backstreet abortion. When she was leaving for the appointment, her Father who had nine children, told her t 

Women had no control over most aspects of their lives. Why? Because once they were married, they lived in fear, every single month, that they would become pregnant. It didn't matter if there was insufficient income to feed more children, or insufficient space for them, or if their health and stamina wasn't sufficient for them to take care of the children they already had. Women died at younger ages. Families lived in poverty. Historically, in most cultures child birth was a woman's affair, and there were some methods of aborting unwanted children, which disappeared in the US when physicians ha 

My grandmother was married at 14 in 1898, she lived in a small village in rural Kentucky. Over the next 24 years she gave birth to 16 live children and one set of still born twins. She kept no records of her miscarriages and refused to talk about them, there were quite a few. She could neither read nor write. She had absolutely no option to tell her husband no to sex. Like any man of his time and area he would have simply taken what he wanted and no one would have raised a single word against him. She was pregnant every single year of her life. After the birth of her last child her doctor told 

My Grandmother got married at the age of 11, and she had 11 children! Sounds quite quirky? But the scene was not ‘uncommon’ before birth control! My Grandfather was a very wise and nobleman. He loved to read. But even he had no idea of birth control as well. Almost every year or in the gap of 2–3 years, my Grandmother had given birth to my uncle-aunts! She never complained. Because she also grew up with 6 brothers of her. So, it was kind of normal.

Do Catholics who practice contraception just not mention it in confession? And why don't priests ever ask about it in confession?
How was pregnancy prevented in the old days?
Cleopatra recommenced crocodile dung. Casanova used a French Letter (condom) made of sheep intestine that was washed and reused because of expense and ignorance of infection. In his circumstances, I bet he used up more than one. There were pessaries similar to diaphragms in the late 1800s. And, of course, there was breastfeeding until the child was two to space pregnancies, don’t use this at home, and the rhythm method after science figured out ovulation and fertility cycles. It is a myth that large families were due to the lack of birth control methods in the past. Women have been trying diffe 

This was on the main thread and it was suggested to me that it be put into its own answer box. It contains some replies to comments made on the other thread, including a discussion of abortion, so if it makes no sense, then read the other answer to this question: Much of the discussion of abortion on this thread seems to assume that the fetus or divided cells are a human being or “baby.” The religious belief is in a soul that is in the cells as soon as the sperm enters the egg. Some believe that it's a sin and crime to prevent the entry of the sperm. Women have been trying to manage the entry o 

Which old days are you asking about? Here’s a quick timeline: Around 3000 B.C. Condoms made from such materials as fish bladders, linen sheaths, and animal intestines. Around 1500 First spermicides introduced which used condoms made from linen cloth sheaths and soaked in a chemical solution and dried before using. 1838 Condoms and diaphragms made from vulcanized rubber. 1873 The Comstock Act passed in the United States prohibiting advertisements, information, and distribution of birth control and allowing the postal service to confiscate birth control sold through the mail. 1916 Margaret Sanger ope 

The methods used as contraceptives in ancient times could easily be considered as painful, dirty and smelly. One of the most dirtiest or risky method of contraception that gained popularity in the ancient times was using the animal dung as a means of contraception. Elephant dung was used in ancient Indian medicine as a means of contraception. In some cultures crocodile dung was also used as a prominent mode of contraceptives.  The animal dungs was believed to be having the sperm inhibiting qualities and were inserted into the vagina to avoid unwanted pregnancy. Several ancient Arabian and ancient E 

Old and semi-organized lecture notes from a college class: What do olive oil and honey, latex, fish bladders, animal intestines, modern pharmaceuticals, and crocodile dung have in common? Yes, they have all been used for birth control, along with linen, various herbs, withdrawal, and pretty much anything people can think up – with varying results. I’ve mentioned that there were times when people welcomed more children, - not all of them survived - and it was a bit of an insurance policy in their old age. However, every child was also a danger to moms before sanitary surgery and antibiotics – with 

Oh there were several methods: Just say “NO…not tonight, dear I have a headache.”Keep track of ovulation. Only have sex when non-fertile or only during or right after having a period. (Natural birth control method)How old are we talking here…because condoms have been around at least since the 1930’s.The withdrawal method…man pulls out before he ejaculates. Not the most reliable but better than nothing.Sponge soaked in vinegar. Sperms die in an acidic environment. The sponge prevents the ejaculate from entering the womb.Diaphragms…also been around since the turn of the century.There were also wa 

In the OLD old days, like the Stone Age? Free love. Contrary to popular belief, Polysexual behavior actually keeps birth-rates low; that’s why you never hear of overpopulated chimp-colonies, despite this going on 24/7:  And so the same resulted from this:  That’s why it was so forbidden by Abrahamic law, when they began seeking to prevent population-gaps with rival civilizations, as things got crowded on God’s green earth…. so they made it even more crowded— but it was their crowd. So some rabbis got together (smart guys that they are), and said “hey, howsabout we breed da fagalas?” And it just got wi 

A chastity belt was an effective means of pregnancy prevention simply because it was altogether physically impossible to have intercourse. (I'm not entirely sure, but I believe that a physician by the name of Dr. Rokowsky was either the one who invented the contraption or advocated for it's use). Picture, if you will, a pair of panties made not from cotton or polyester but instead consisting of some form of strong metal. There was a belt about the waist that could be secured with a lock and key. The Chastity Best was a practice dating back to medieval times. Perhaps, such practices of bondage  

My parents were married in late 1939. They limited themselves to 2 children by my mother using a diaphragm. Both of their children were deliberately planned. Back in ancient times, a child really didn’t exist until ceremonially recognized as a member of the family. Unwanted children were not recognized and were placed in special spots where anyone could pick them up - to use as a slave or to be adopted in the case of a barren marriage. More recently, unwanted children in 19th and early 20th century America were “farmed out” i.e. they were given to childless relatives to work on their farms until 

Abstinence was easier when it was expected. Peer pressure still occurred, but since saying no was common, it was easier to do. Education about cycle tracking was better. Today, most schools teach that the “rhythm” method (which they describe as using a calendar) is ineffective. That is true. What they don't tell you is that tracking your fertility is fairly easy, inexpensive, and very effective. Our schools today leave out of sex education class the details about how our bodies function! Tracking mucus and temperature is as accurate as the pill, without putting hormones in your body. Male circum 

If I’m 50% of the baby, why can’t I have a say about abortion?
This is such a strange question but I will do my best. I think you mean whether male or female both share 50% of making the baby and consequences of it. I'm not sure if you are a female or a male. I'm not gonna assume what you are. You are allowed to have opinions about abortion whether male or female. If you are pregnant or you have impregnated a woman then you should have a well informed and deep discussion or multiple discussions on what you think should happen going forward together. Always be honest no matter how difficult it is. There's is nothing wrong with not wanting to not have a baby or t 

For many reasons including the ones that make this a poor question You aren’t 50% of the baby. You are approximately 0% of the baby if you are male (if you’re female things are slightly more complex but the baby grew itself in your womb). And kids are not property so it wouldn’t matter anyway.If you are male you do not contribute 50% of the baby - or even 50% of the baby’s DNA (mitochondrial DNA being a thing); the egg is much bigger than the sperm, and the food comes from the mother’s body.Even if you were 50% of the baby. What matters is that the mother has the controlling interest in her wom

Sure, you definitely can have an opinion about abortion. You simply cannot legally do shit about any pregnancy.  So, you plan to be the first cismale human to ever become pregnant and carry the pregnancy up term, huh? Bah hah hah hah hah hah hah!! No male human has ever been "50% of" any human baby.  Ignorant means uniformed or lacking knowledge. Guys are amazingly and amusingly ignorant and arrogant about pregnancies. Here is some information: A man ejaculates between 1.25 and 6.8 cc (ml) of semen each time. That is about 0.25 to 1.38 teaspoons each time. One cc of semen contains ~100 million sperm cell 

If we're talking about an abortion, we're not talking about a baby. We're talking about a fetus. There are, in my view, two defensible metaphysical views on fetuses: A fetus is a person. It has personhood totally independent of its parents. Its parents have no authority over whether it should live or die. Whatever happens with the pregnancy happens.A fetus is not a person. It's more of a potential person, and as long as it's inside an actual person's body, that actual person has full authority over it, including whether or not it should be born.Notice how neither of these views says anything abo 

If you are the biological father, you can certainly give your opinion to the mother regarding your feelings on the pregnancy, BUT it is her that is carrying the child, so ultimately she will have the final say in how to move forward, to either keep, give up for adoption, or abort the pregnancy. If you are anti abortion, and she is considering an abortion for whatever reason, and you wish to keep, and take full custody of, and responsibility for the infant you may want to ask if she is willing to carry the pregnancy to term, and allow you to be sole guardian/caretaker for the infant… She may be  

Let’s say the baby was born. It’s 50% yours. You helped raise it, put it through school… …and then, on the eve of going into high school, tragedy struck. Your child was critically injured in a severe car crash, and will die without a liver transplant. You are not of the right tissue type. The mother is. Answer this question with a yes or no. No equivocation, no prevarication, just yes or no. Do you have the moral authority to force the child’s mother to donate her liver if she doesn’t want to? Yes or no? After all, the child is half yours, so why can’t you have an opinion? The key factor here, the  

If I’m 50% of the baby, why can’t I have an opinion about abortion? This is not about the baby*, this is about the body it is living in. And that is 100% the mother’s. It’s like expecting to have a say in your child being evicted out of a house that’s not yours only because it’s your child. The only one who has a say in this is the owner of the house. *And of course what is aborted is not a baby. What is aborted in the vast majority of cases are zygotes, embryos or early stage fetuses, unable to survive on their own and unable to think, feel or suffer. They are not babies, they are cell clusters 

You can have an opinion about anything. You cannot use your opinions to make someone else do something they don’t want to do. The basic understanding is that other people have their own needs, you don’t get to use your own needs or thoughts or opinions to control their actions. when it comes to abortion, you are not 50% of the baby. The baby is 100% of the baby. You get to control whether you begin a pregnancy or not by controlling where you put your sexual parts. Contraception is not 100%. While the foetus is inside the mother the woman gets to control everything about both their lives because 

Are you the dad? If you’re the dad, your contribution to the biological process is done and dusted. You knew how pregnancies happened before you offered your 49%, and your decision making window closed at that point. Nobody forced you and nobody lied to you about how conception occurs. You have bodily autonomy, which is upheld by law. You could have refused to have sex, you could have worn a condom, or you could have had a vasectomy. You chose to do none of these things, while fully aware of the consequences. Also, the woman you had sex with had no capacity to override your bodily autonomy in t 

You can have any opinion that you want. The father is 50% of the genes. The mother is 50% of the genes, and all nine months of the gestation, if the fetus is carried to term. Are you going to step up and carry that baby inside of you for 4.5 months, Mr. Carmichael? Are you going to do 50% of the birth labor? Run 50% of the risk that the birth will be breech? That a c-section will be necessary? That the pregnancy or the birth will go dangerously wrong? Pregnancy can be extremely difficult, extremely uncomfortable, especially in the later stages. Women can die in the process, yes, here in the US, the  

If a father wants to keep his child, but the mother wants to have an abortion, who has the final say?
I agree with many other answers that it's ultimately mother’s decision and must remain that way. But I don't think many answers touched on the issue of how big a decision abortion is for women, and how men (future potential father) can play a role in this decision process. I think many people, especially pro-life people, want to paint women seeking abortion as either cruel and callous or ignorant and careless. They imagine women make the decision over a cup of coffee in the morning, go to the clinics in the afternoon, and go out drinking in the night. But reality is overwhelmingly the opposite.  

The reason why you are even asking this question in the first place, is because you are fundamentally mistaken to believe in the blue pill notion that society and law will protect your right to attempt to plan a future for yourself and your future offspring. The belief that as a father, you have some sort of inherent “claim” to your children that society will respect and protect… You will not like this answer. However, it wont make it any less true: men have NO reproductive rights whatsoever in the west (or pretty nuch anywhere civilized for that matter) …zero, nil, zilch. Read that again, unders 

Many answers here is based on assumed prepositions that are not claimed in the original question. The question is somewhat ambiguous in the sense that we are provided no context in the process that lead to the said circumstance. At the least, the “Family” tag implies that the question assumes that the father and the mother are married. It does not, however, indicate whether there was any consent for having a baby. Context matters. If the mother explicitly insisted a protected sex but the father forced himself on her and impregnated her, all say goes to the mother. She did not agree to have baby  

The pregnant woman is the only person who gets any say in the outcome of her pregnancy. Men become fathers when there is a child to parent, and up until that point they are quite simply men who impregnated a woman. While mothers and fathers have equal rights and responsibilities, a man has neither when it comes to a fetus residing inside a woman’s body. Morally speaking it might be appropriate for a man to support a woman who is pregnant by him, just as a woman may want to allow a man to express his feelings regarding her pregnancy, but this is all done on a voluntary and case-by-case basis, be 

Do you know how oysters make pearls?  Oysters have a substance called nacre. When a grain of sand or some foreign material slips in between one of the two shells of the oyster, it keeps covering the particle with layers of nacre. Overtime, a beautiful pearl is formed. Now, do you think the sand grain and the oyster gave equal contribution for the formation of pearl? Man gives the sperm. Woman gives the egg. Man gives half-DNA and Woman gives other half-DNA. But a woman’s contribution doesn’t just stop there. She gives the 9-month environment for the baby to form, nutrition for the baby to grow and con 

Firstly she isn’t a mother as yet, she is simply a woman who has discovered she is pregnant. The fetus inside her has no ability to live by itself and if it has no mother to care for it, it will never be able to get to that stage where it will be able to independently survive. A Father who wants to “keep his child” can go to court to request custody of the child. However, there is no child as yet, there is just the possibility of one at some time in the future should everything go right with the pregnancy. Women who are forced to undergo a pregnancy that they do not want suffer terribly. We canno 

“I am NOT a supporter for abortion. It's killing a child. That's not ok. That being said it is BOTH parents child, not just the mothers. That's what people need to realize. Regardless if it's the man or woman that wants the child alive, the baby has to be born. Now it's debatable whether the person who did not want the baby has to pay any sort of child support or anything like that. They can give up all right of being a parent I suppose. But really, it seams the same people that support abortion don't support capital puniment, they'd rather kill a child than a criminal, and here I am down the r 

Let's say abortion is illegal. Let's say the mother doesn't want the pregnancy to continue but the father does. “It's her body” means it is her, the woman. She can attempt — through all the mechanisms women have always known about — to end the pregnancy. She may realize the high risks of getting an infection and becoming sterile, or of dying. But maybe she really doesn't want to have this man’s child. Or maybe she really doesn't want to become a parent right now. Or maybe she suspects she won't make it through the pregnancy because of prior complications. Imprisoning her to deny her contact to ch 

You know, I have to say it. This is addressed to every man who gives women this argument. “ You, as a man, have the ability to not procreate while having sex. Birth control is in your grasp. You, as a man. Have the ability to COMMUNICATE. You know, open mouth, move jaw, make words? Use sign language, write on a piece of paper? Send up smoke signals? So, if you want a baby and she is the one you're having sex with why in hell didn’t you say beforehand what you wanted and get on the same page? Instead of yelling, whining and going on about it after the fact? It’s called responsibility dude. And let  

Unfortunately, where there is legal abortion, it is all in the woman’s hands. The fact that she knowingly took part in unprotected sex and then refuses to acknowledge her responsibility to the child she has created doesn’t appear to matter. Abortion has become a form of birth control in many places and while I agree there are times a termination is desirable (rape, incest etc.) it was never meant to replace birth control and abstinence. Many, many women would do anything to get pregnant, if you do so accidently and do not wish to raise a child at this time, why can’t you allow your child to be 

Is abortion the cause of infertility with women?
My religion teacher told us abortion is never medically necessary to save a woman’s life. Is this true?
No, this isn’t true. Reproduction is hard for humans, so hard that it’s often fatal. We need to talk honestly about that. UNICEF’s data shows that, in 2017, the maternal death rate (deaths of women due to pregnancy- or delivery-related problems) was at an all-time low of a little more than one out of 500 women who had live births. That’s significant. That’s a lot of moms dying. In America, there were four moms who died for every one who died in Europe, looking at the same number of live births. That’s also significant, because it shows that these deaths are preventable. The maternal death rates 

Hello Your Pet Lizard. ETA: I need to amend my answer, Caitlin responded directly to me - I urge you to view her comments to my answer. I will keep my original answer in it’s ingloriousness so you know where we both came from - don’t judge me we all make mistakes. Her teacher’s info comes from “Abortion Can Be Medically Necessary” a reply to that statement on liveaction dot org which disagrees with that statement and had a whole video suggesting why. The main point of it suggests that instead of an abortion for super high risk pregnancies they try for a “pre-term delivery” around 22 weeks gestat 

I would show her this link below. I think this was one of the main reasons Ireland, a very religious Catholic country, voted to allow abortions. She’s actually telling you lies which is one of the seven deadly sins, “thou shall not bear false witness”. Either that or she is definitely too uneducated to be a teacher.  Death of Savita Halappanavar - Wikipedia Also, botched back street abortions have caused death, disease and misery to countless women who just couldn’t afford to feed another child. An embryo is an embryo, a foetus is a foetus. Neither is a baby, both are in the process of becoming. 

It depends. If by abortion they simply mean terminating the pregnancy early then it is not true. There are a number of conditions that can endanger a woman’s life if the pregnancy is allowed to continue to term (or in some cases earlier). e.g. Ectopic pregnancies, preeclampsia or any number of other existing conditions that are exacerbated by the pregnancy or which cannot be treated properly due to the effect it would have on the fetus. In those cases terminating the pregnancy early can be medically beneficial. This is the interpretation that most of the pro-choice answers seem to be using. Howe 

Not quite It is true that in late term, abortion would be unlikely to save the mother’s life over inducing labor of a live baby because most importantly, those cases tend to just need you to not have the baby in you, not require that the baby is dead That’s a stark way of putting it, yes, but it is true Take preeclampsia, for example. That is basically high blood pressure from the pregnancy, but notably that will be solved by early delivery just the same So in that sense, yes, sometimes some prochoicers can somewhat overstate how common that would be However, it is true that ectopic pregnancies are 

Nope. I am guessing your religion teacher isn’t a doctor or even very well educated. Has he ever heard of etopic pregnancies, Most common cause of death for pregnant women in their first trimester, and no the embryo cannot be re implanted somewhere else. An etopic pregnancy will kill the mother ( and the embryo) Pregnancy is high risk for a women. Later in a pregnancy there are other risks to the pregnant woman which can result in her death if the pregnancy is continued. Peripartum cardiomyopathy. Pregnancy induced heart failure. It will kill the mother and the fetus dies with the mother. Plac 

My religion teacher told us abortion is never medically necessary to save a woman’s life. Is this true? It is not true. But it is rarer that some of the answers I see are implying. Ectopic pregnancy is an oft-cited condition used to justify abortion. **However, it is often possible to move the zygote and implant it in the uterus. As medical science improves, the need for an abortion becomes less and less necessary for these cases. **Thanks to Anna Butler for correcting me on this; I had misread an article. After her information in the comments, I went back and looked more carefully. I could find  

My religion teacher told us abortion is never medically necessary to save a woman’s life. Is this true? Absolutely not. According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, about 1 in 50 pregnancies result in an ectopic pregnancy. These pregnancies are not viable and the death rate for women before modern intervention was available (abortion) was more than 50%. The death rate is now thankfully less than 2% in developed countries - but that means women are still dying. In my own case I was born with a heart defect. I, and others like myself with the same condition, have been advised pregnancy c 

Absolutely not.  What your teacher said is not only incredibly ignorant but dangerous. Lies like that have cost people their lives.  There are countless examples where abortion can be medically necessary to save the life of a pregnant person or due to fetal abnormalities. Two examples of saving the pregnant person include ectopic pregnancies (which can never go to term) and partial miscarriages—if an abortion doesn’t occur, the fetus will begin to decay in their body and they could die of septicemia. With fetal abnormalities, there are so many possibilities—I saw a case where the fetus’ stomach an 

Unless your religion teacher is a doctor of medicine, I would take his or her word about a medical matter with several grains of salt. There are times when it is medically necessary to terminate a pregnancy to save the mother’s life. Ectopic pregnancy - A pregnancy that occurs outside the uterus. A woman’s uterus is designed to hold and nourish a baby during the nine months of a pregnancy. Other places in the body are not designed to do that, and the mother could become gravely ill if the pregnancy is allowed to go on for too long.Abruptio placentiae - bleeding between the placenta and the uteri

Why is being able to abort pregnancies so important to some people?
This question makes it sound like this is an ideology… as though women are desperate to have the chance to have an abortion. They are not. Honestly, no woman wants an abortion. Abortion is a remedy not an outcome. It is one of the myriad ways that medicine can save a woman’s life (literally or metaphorically) and its medical efficacy is why it should be legal just as amputation or chemotherapy is legal (although I believe no one wants any of these ‘cures’ if there is an alternative or believes it is legal to just chop off an arm or blast someone with poisonous drugs just willy nilly). Women mer 

I would like to tell you three stories. I can’t name two of the people in them, to protect their privacy, but these are 100% true stories. The first is of a young woman I was close friends with who became pregnanct at 17, and decided to keep the baby. She had been using a very effective method of contraception under the care of a doctor, but still became pregnant. Unfortunately, she developed an infection and then developed sepsis so serious that she was hospitalized in intensive care. Her doctors decided it would be best for her health to abort the baby, so that they could give her more aggres 

Well, the ability to abort children is totally unimportant to me personally. First, biologically, I would never need to do it anyway. And secondly, "abort children" is an oxymoron. Embryos and fetuses are not "children" or "babies", they are embryos or fetuses. If you need to use needlessly loaded language, it indicates you have a weak position to start with. Embryos and fetuses, not babies and children, are aborted. Babies and children have already been born, and so by definition cannot be aborted. Why is it important to me as a political position? Because in no other case do we require a huma 

If a person is honest, they admit that the issue of abortion is extremely complicated for multiple reasons. If a person is honest, they acknowledge that there are medical, ethical, religious, economic, legal, social, familial, culture, and gender questions involved. Now, a major reason Liberals and and Conservatives differ so much on this issue is that Liberals are willing to admit when they don’t know something, and therefore, should refrain from making or influencing a decision that doesn’t involve them. Meanwhile, Conservatives are frequently very uncomfortable with gray areas. They often thi 

That's a misinterpretation of the issue, at least to this liberal. To me the question is the other way around:  to what extent is government interference in the personal decision to have an abortion warranted, and for what reasons? I have no problem with an individual, or a group of like-minded individuals, determining for themselves that they will not eat pork.  I have no problem with that individual or group trying to persuade people to share that practice.  I have a problem when that group attempts to legislate that practice into law for everyone, and the problem is exacerbated if the basis f

Abortion is pretty complicated. On the one hand you have the mother carrying the child. Perhaps she’s too young to have a baby, perhaps its inconvenient, perhaps she’s been raped.. perhaps there’s other reasons that having the baby is not something she wants. Regardless - wanting women in general to be able to choose if she wants the child or not is important to many. On the other hand you have the fact that many consider the fetus a child. Which means that the most important person to protect is the unborn baby.. and that the potential mother’s wishes comes second. Perhaps its a personal view, 

Why is being able to block other people’s ability to abort pregnancies so important to conservatives? The same conservatives that are so “pro-life” that they’d ban abortion completely, usually disdain increases in taxes (or any other liberal propositions) that would feed and heal the people that are dying of hunger or illness in their very country. Is being “pro-life” the common theme there? No it isn’t. The common theme is f*ck the victim (pregnant woman, poor person), because conservatives see their situation as a punishment (probably from god), and in the conservatives’ view they probably de 

Because people will do it anyway. It’s safer for a pill or doctor to do it for them. As with any action people strongly feel they have to do, the law won’t and can’t prevent them from doing it. All making it illegal does is drive it underground to a world of back alleys and coat-hangers. Now I don’t subscribe to a rights-based view of morality. It will inevitably end up with contradictions. I prefer to look at situations on a case-by-case basis and assess the morality or immorality from there. In the immediate aftermath of conception the “fetus” is literally a ball of cells incapable of transmitt 

I am not exactly a typical US liberal (I imagine they are the liberals the OP meant) but I agree with them on some issues. So… why is the ability to decide on abortions important? US liberals tend to be, well, liberal on personal issues - as in, they argue that the individuals should decide on matters related to their private lives such as abortions. No one I have met or talked to LIKES abortions, and to almost everyone they are a serious issue and possibly a heart-wrenching one. There are birth control methods most people don’t thing much of, such as condoms or the pill. Abortions are not seen

If I’m 50% of the baby, why can’t I have a say about abortion?
This is such a strange question but I will do my best. I think you mean whether male or female both share 50% of making the baby and consequences of it. I'm not sure if you are a female or a male. I'm not gonna assume what you are. You are allowed to have opinions about abortion whether male or female. If you are pregnant or you have impregnated a woman then you should have a well informed and deep discussion or multiple discussions on what you think should happen going forward together. Always be honest no matter how difficult it is. There's is nothing wrong with not wanting to not have a baby or t 

For many reasons including the ones that make this a poor question You aren’t 50% of the baby. You are approximately 0% of the baby if you are male (if you’re female things are slightly more complex but the baby grew itself in your womb). And kids are not property so it wouldn’t matter anyway.If you are male you do not contribute 50% of the baby - or even 50% of the baby’s DNA (mitochondrial DNA being a thing); the egg is much bigger than the sperm, and the food comes from the mother’s body.Even if you were 50% of the baby.

If we're talking about an abortion, we're not talking about a baby. We're talking about a fetus. There are, in my view, two defensible metaphysical views on fetuses: A fetus is a person. It has personhood totally independent of its parents. Its parents have no authority over whether it should live or die. Whatever happens with the pregnancy happens.A fetus is not a person. It's more of a potential person, and as long as it's inside an actual person's body, that actual person has full authority over it, including whether or not it should be born.Notice how neither of these views says anything abo 

If you are the biological father, you can certainly give your opinion to the mother regarding your feelings on the pregnancy, BUT it is her that is carrying the child, so ultimately she will have the final say in how to move forward, to either keep, give up for adoption, or abort the pregnancy.

I want to be pregnant, but I'm 14 almost 15. What should I do?
Try to simulate what life might be like having a child. Try the following for at least 2–3 years and see how much you like it. -First give up going out and or having fun. -Try to see if you can get a job or at least work for someone else, try to at least get yourself working 80 hours a week, as this will simulate having a full-time job and the time it takes to take care of your kids. -get someone to wake you up at least 3–6 times a night, preferably in an uncomfortable fashion ( bucket of water, loud siren, loud crying sound etc.) -You have to wake up early everyday, try to get up at 6 am everyday 

I got pregnant when I was 13. I had my son when I was 14. I had another baby at 18. I was by no means wanting a child the first go around. At some point, right around the time I started puberty, I did want a baby. It was just baby fever and it passed. A year later, condom broke my first time and boom. Pregnant. I was mortified. I didn’t have sex again for years. At 14/15 you don’t have the means to care for a living, completely dependent human. You can’t drive, you can’t work. Your main responsibilities up to this point have been school, and still will be for a few years. Your parents might not

Then, based on your answer, I will tell you this: Being pregnant lasts 9 months.

The last two of which you will have stretch marks on your belly, your breasts, your buttocks and your thighs. Those stretch marks never go away. Say good bye to bikini bod. Then, you will have difficulty sleeping as the baby gets larg 

I’m 22, I had my now 5 year old at 17. I’m grateful I finished school and didn’t have to sit my exams pregnant or with a newborn honestly. I think this is the type of situation where no matter how many times someone tells you how hard it is, you think it’s worth it. Of course it is, but if I’m completely honest I’ve lost count of the times I’ve cried and felt broken because I should’ve waited.

First, why? What are the reasons you think you are ready physically, emotionally, and financially to have a child? Are you in need of attention? Are you lonely? Are you afraid of expectations of graduating high school and going to college? Are other girls around you getting pregnant and getting lots of attention, so you want the same experience and treatment? Take these questions seriously. Now, what you probably haven't thought of. Having a child when you're too young to take care of it financially, emotionally, and physically, just because you “want to be pregnant,” is literally the MOST SELFISH THI 

I am 18, and my fiance is 19. By the time we are 19 and 20 our first child will be born. Both of us have good paying jobs (well above minimum wage). We are moved out. He owns a car. We pay our bills on time, and he is going to college with no debt. Even though we are relatively stable for our age, there are many many obstacles that we are facing to bring our baby into the world. We have to find a bigger house to rent (cheap one bedroom apartment won't cut it), we have to find insurance that will cover my pregnancy (birth is extremely expensive), among many other things. My fiance is in school  

Please don’t. I have two daughters and a crazy ex wife. My marriage was very bad, because my ex wife was very dominant and wanted to be in control all the time. Our fights were terrible. My old daughter left home when she was around eightteen. She was forced by her mom to follow a study she didn’t want to do. Her four years younger sister was 14 at that time and was and now over ten years later is still a person with a mental disorder who fights to find her identity. She always needed to be the center of everybody, wanted and still wants attention. With 14 she decided to become a mother. She was 

Sweetheart, I agree with most of the other Quorans who are saying this is not a good idea. It will really affect your life prospects. You have talents and abilities that the world needs - and one day, when you are ready, you can bring a child into that world, once you have established yourself a little. A child deserves the love of both a mother and a father so that the baby grows up with all he or she needs to feel confident in life. Getting pregnant as teenager usually means that the Dad does not stay around. If you are not loved and appreciated at home, you may be looking for someone to love  

Wheb I was 15, I was so in love with my boyfriend and really contemplating about wanting to have a baby. Well my cousin being 14, actually ended up getting pregnant though she doesn’t hate having her son, because she love him with all her heart. But she never got to go out and have fun with us, she was always stuck with her son by herself.. he boyfriend told her he’d be there and he disappeared after having experiencing parenthood and what it comes with. It hard doing it alone even if you have someone can’t always depend on them. Then Later me still being with the same boyfriend, as I was when 

I felt like that as a teen. It's more about power or feeling love you think your missing in life. Here's the kicker. Kids don't love you the way you want and need to be loved Nd quite frankly they are all absolute assholes at times. But you can't break up with your child and go out looking for something better. Additionally your only 14. You have 10 more years to grow your body in a healthy way and the human brain doesn't finnish growing and maturing until the age of 24. Having a baby at your age is dangerous for your health, education, and mental health. (Can't exactly go out with friends or t 

I just found out my 16 year old daughter is pregnant. She's keeping the baby. What advice would you give me, as her mother, on handling this situation? I am open to all advice. What are your words of wisdom?
I got pregnant at 16 and kept it. I love my daughter but keeping her has ruined my life until recently. Half the issue is the pregnancy and effort involved in raising a child. As your yourself know, that is challenging on its own when you do it properly and dedicate yourself to doing it well. But the thing that really fucked me was everyone around me. I cannot understate how wholly and maliciously I was ostracised. I was a straight-A student, popular enough, involved with charity work and generally considered a good kid. I’d been with my boyfriend over two years and we were planning to get marri 

See the baby, not the mistake. When my brother was 16, his girlfriend got pregnant. She was terrified of her parents’ response, so they didn’t tell anyone. He stood by her side, but kept silent out of respect for her. Her little body was so stressed it held the baby inside. I was married at the same time and pregnant with the first grand baby. My belly was huge, she looked like she had just put in a few pounds. She stayed silent. One day, we woke up and my brother was missing. When we finally listened to the voice mail, we heard her crying his name softly and him saying he was on his way. She soun 

A lot has already been said about accentuating the positive, but I will start there Remember that you’re about to meet your grandchild and that child will have the benefit of knowing you as a grandmother who will be a part of his/her life for a long time. You will also get the benefit of watching that grandchild grow to adulthood and perhaps get to hold your great-grandchildren. With that said it’s important for you to acknowledge and understand that you have and will have negative feelings and those negative feelings are not, per se, wrong. All the advice so far has been to smile and carry on,  

First, take a deep breath. The same thing happened with our youngest daughter, pregnant at 16, had her baby just after she turned 17. Our small city has an unfortunate number of teen pregnancies. The high school our daughter attended even had a daycare which worked with the young moms, letting them know if a small baby needed to be fed, holding classes on child care, finances, family potlucks, etc. We thought we had done everything right, taught our children right from wrong, sex Ed, and all those other responsible parent things, but hey, things happen. We opted to love her and her baby, some of 

My suggestion is very simple, you are her mother, I’m guessing this pregnancy wasn’t planned and your daughter did everything she could to be safe and hopefully her partner did as well. Stuff happens, she and her partner could have been extremely safe and this still happened. You are her mother, you gave birth to her, so you know what she is going through because you were in those shoes at one point. Do not reject, abandon or disown your daughter or do anything that could hurt her, she is only sixteen, doing anything rash or negative won’t end well. Also being that she is just sixteen, It coul 

Many answers here are focused on your daughter but you also are going through a hard time. I got pregnant at 17 and my daughter got pregnant at 19. My daughter wasn't married and didn't have a stable job or income when she became pregnant and it gave me some insight on how my own mom may have felt when I got pregnant so young. I tried to hide it but I was embarrassed by my daughter's pregnancy and felt like I had failed as a mother. Maybe this sounds very selfish, but I also worried about how much I would need to help her or if I would end up raising this baby. I even had someone tell me that  

Thirty years ago I was 16 and pregnant and adamant I was keeping my baby. (This was not due to religious reasons, I later chose to not continue with another pregnancy. I am pro-choice for women and their bodies). My family was distraught, understandably, but I was not wavering. Very naive, as I had no idea what I was getting into and yet I have never had a single day of regret. My beautiful 30 year old has bright pink hair and is a beautiful person who has filled my life with colour, laughter and tears. She is my closest friend, even though we currently live on separate continents, and we have 

My dad told me that if it happened to me that he’d send me to my sister’s out of state. I could have the baby &amp; they would adopt it. At the time he told me I was 17, with no boyfriend. As Catholics, unwed pregnancy was a worrying issue for my parents with 5 daughters. I told him, I didn’t think it would be an issue but why did he need me to know that. Turns out a friend at work, also Catholic, found out his teenage daughter just had an abortion &amp; it broke his heart that she didn’t think she could have talked to him beforehand. About 3 yrs ago I was rethinking my dad’s advice &amp; realized he only t 

GIVE THEM SUPPORT I was pregnant at the age of 15. I had my son 12 days before my 16th birthday. My mother didn’t make much money and we were already living at my grandmother's house. My father (whom I had just recently been kicked out of his home due to a devious stepmother) I dared not even tell him until I was beyond the abortion date (I knew he would pressure me into an abortion) So here I was …15 and pregnant with seemingly ZERO support. Things changed when I told my boyfriend about the pregnancy. Of course, he was shocked and as frightened as me, but he was also very excited about being a  

I have a different take on this, from my own personal experience. The same thing happened to me, when I was 15, and I too, wanted to keep the baby. Before I answer fully, let me give you a little background information on the circumstances which led me to be in this position in the first place. I was a freshman in high school, I went to an all girls school (catholic), and my best friends older brother, was the senior at an all boys school, asked he asked me to his senior prom. At the time, I thought I was in love with him, And begged my parents to let me go to his prom with him, and despite th

Her four years younger sister was 14 at that time and was and now over ten years later is still a person with a mental disorder who fights to find her identity. She always needed to be the center of everybody, wanted and still wants attention. With 14 she decided to become a mother. She was 

Sweetheart, I agree with most of the other Quorans who are saying this is not a good idea. It will really affect your life prospects. You have talents and abilities that the world needs - and one day, when you are ready, you can bring a child into that world, once you have established yourself a little. A child deserves the love of both a mother and a father so that the baby grows up with all he or she needs to feel confident in life. Getting pregnant as teenager usually means that the Dad does not stay around. If you are not loved and appreciated at home, you may be looking for someone to love  

Wheb I was 15, I was so in love with my boyfriend and really contemplating about wanting to have a baby. Well my cousin being 14, actually ended up getting pregnant though she doesn’t hate having her son, because she love him with all her heart. But she never got to go out and have fun with us, she was always stuck with her son by herself.. he boyfriend told her he’d be there and he disappeared after having experiencing parenthood and what it comes with. It hard doing it alone even if you have someone can’t always depend on them. Then Later me still being with the same boyfriend, as I was when 

I felt like that as a teen. It's more about power or feeling love you think your missing in life. Here's the kicker. Kids don't love you the way you want and need to be loved Nd quite frankly they are all absolute assholes at times. But you can't break up with your child and go out looking for something better. Additionally your only 14. You have 10 more years to grow your body in a healthy way and the human brain doesn't finnish growing and maturing until the age of 24. Having a baby at your age is dangerous for your health, education, and mental health. (Can't exactly go out with friends or t 

How does the age at which parents conceive affect the child?
I was 41 yo when I gave birth via C-section to my first child, a big, beautiful, healthy boy (after having had a miscarriage at 40 yo.) . I had genetic testing done and an amniocentesis at 16 weeks in utero......there were no issues identified. After delivery, my health was never the same.........recovery from the incision was long and hard as my baby had been living in a "swimming pool" as my Doctor said, so I had a very large belly. I developed two protruding discs during the pregnancy, and had retained a LOT of water which affected my weight and mobility. My son was perfect and he has never 

I had my first and only child, David, at 36. It was a natural delivery at 8 in the morning after only 9 hours of labor, and we left the hospital that evening. The next day I had some errand to run, can’t remember to where but all the people there raved over my little (6.5 pound) baby. One of the ladies asked how old he was. I replied “You know that expression, ‘I wasn’t born yesterday’? He can’t say that!” Because my husband and I both had doctorates most of our friends and acquaintances also had their children in their thirties, so our ages weren’t an issue socially for either us or our son. A 

Speaking from the perspective of the child, my mom was 37 when I was born, and my dad had just turned 50. I am my moms only child, my dad already had my two sisters from a previous marriage who were 22 and 23 when I was born I would say it was more the thought that my dad and sisters were older than most that impacted me negatively, more than their actual ages did (my mom is not too far off in age of most of my friends parents). While I grew up wishing I had sisters closer in age to me, I have had 2 amazing role models to look up to my entire life, who have gone out of their way to form a very  

I don’t have an exact answer to this, but I kind of wanted to discuss it anyway. I was born on my dad’s 22nd birthday, just under two months before my mom’s 22nd birthday. They went on to have three other kids by the time they were 30. My daughter was born a few months after I turned 31. I felt like I was behind the game, so to speak. I was divorced, remarried, and am now expecting twin boys around the time of my next birthday, when I’ll be turning 40. When I had my first kid, I thought about my parents and how they had all their kids out of the house by the time they were 50. I’m going to have  

I'm assuming you understand the biological risks that increase when having children at an older age. In my case, I had fewer complications than my younger colleagues. My second child was born natural without any drugs. That all being said, having children in my late 30's and at 40 was a better personal decision. My husband is 5.5 years older than me and also agrees. I recall being able to bounce back faster after all-nighters in my 20's. This ability is helpful with babies. I'm sure my body would look nicer as well, after two children. As your children get older and eventually have their own fa 

My daughter is adopted but I was 46 when that happened. My husband was 41. Luckily we both feel and look younger than our ages but we definitely feel the age factor at times. I do worry about my daughter in the future when her parents (us) pass away. However I still have my two grandmothers in their 90’s and both still live independently. So I guess I have genes in my favor. But to compensate for the worry of my age, I have actively made sure that my daughter cultivates many loving relationships. She is only five years old but she has many many adults in her life that love and care about her an 

I had my last baby at 41. She’s happy and healthy, and because we are better set financially and have our careers and life more together, we have more time to enjoy her. I also have children who are 17 and 13, so I had my first at 31. I don’t see much difference physically at all in the ten years between pregnanciesz. I haven’t slowed down at all — jeez, I’m younger than George Clooney and he has toddler twins! We go camping and hiking and travel, and she’s easy and funny. The difference is that when she is 20, I will be 61, and my husband will be 66. So she will travel with us as a teen when  

Both my parents were in their early 40’s when I was born. I was my father’s firstborn and my mother’s only female child. I had two brothers on my mother’s side who were 19 and 17 years older than me. My second brother died when I was 10. My oldest brother is still around but he is a narcissist who never took care of anyone due to this I was the main caregiver to my mother and now the main provider to my father. So here is my answer, these pregnancies can take a toll on the health of the mother. But my mother did generally well in life and she died at 83 when I was 41. At the time of my birth, t 

it depends, but there probably is a link, in general. Face it, we change as we age, not just physically but mentally. I gave birth at 44 to twins. Probably as a result of my age, they were delivered 2 months premature. Which had a string of complications. But thankfully with the exception of a long stay in the NICU, they were just perfect. Small but perfect. My twins just turned 18 and my husband (who is 6 years younger than me) and I have enjoyed every moment of their lives. We have travelled all over the world with them, and yes some days I may have been a little slower than the group (ha) bu 

Well from my own experience I gave birth at 42 and my partner was 55. I also had a child at 27 and 33 and lost a son at 38 as he was born at 22 weeks. All my births were c sections. By the time I was pregnant at 42 I was exhausted all the time and the pregnancy was taking every bit of strength I had. I gave birth at 38 weeks so not to haemorrhage, the surgeons were shocked at the state my womb was in. Very scarred and in their words “amazed that it carried my child '” I expected my daughter to be my largest baby but she came out at barely 5lb I think as my body struggled to feed her in my womb 

How would you react if your 16-year-old daughter got pregnant?
I'm 14 and pregnant. How do I tell my parents?
This is just this is just my opinion, and it could be totally wrong, but how you approach this depends on what kind of person you are and what kind of relationship you have with your mother. I mean if you are the type of person that doesn't get into trouble, and you have a close relationship with your mom, that would be something easy to accomplish as far as telling her because you would have an open communication relationship with her. But if you're the type of person that has led a crazy kind of life and you don't have the best relationship with your mom, then that would need a different app 

You start by telling them what you are about to say is very hard and you will need their support and understanding and then you just say it. At first they will be upset and then normally after they have had a bit of time to realize what this means for you and for them, they will want to support you. This is a tough place to be in, but depending upon the nature of your relationship with your parents, telling them is smart for many different reasons. The first reason is, that they can support you in making a decision about how you want to proceed. The second is that you are going to need their he 

the reason why i decided to tell my story is because everyone is taking about their experiences having their children at 14 and they and all grown up now. i made the opposite decision, incase you are thinking of abortion. i was 15 when i became pregnant. it was a stupid mistake, i was skipping school to go with my boyfriend at the time that i thought i loved so dearly. i became pregnant sometime in may, but never got the pregnancy symptoms, like morning sickness or fainting etc. i have a very random period so i was always confused with my cycle. i wasnt sure that i was pregnant until august, a  

First, sorry I did not see this. By now it may be not very useful to you but maybe for someone else… before I answer here is my personal experience. I was 14 when I realized I was pregnant. I had my first son at 15, after my freshman year in high school. I did not tell my parents till I was a good 5 months into the pregnancy. I do not recommenced doing this ever. Even though I was terrified of their response, especially at such a young age and for such an important thing, they needed to know I was pregnant. When I did tell them, I told them together. My mother turned to my dad and said in the mos 

I'm going to approach this from a realistic angle and assume that you meant that the sex was consensual between you and an older boy, perhaps over the age of 18, and that the pregnancy was unexpected. It seems to me that even being just shy of 14, if you intended to get pregnant for whatever reason, the boldness and adult nature used in making such a choice would be the same confident nature with which you break the news to your parents. After all, the decision would have been one that you made for the life you've planned ahead, so why would there be any fear or hesitation in telling them? Havi 

First congratulations. You are now on the track to growing up super super quick. First take a deep breath because its not you who is upset by this. This is simply about letting everyone who loves you know that this wonderful thing that has happened is going to effect everyone you know . This blow comes extremely heavy to parents who have these dreams hopes and goals because for them all of those expectations for you have become shattered for them but not you. But the truth is for you , nothing is shattered, everything in life for them will be ok, but the real changes will bounce back to you, so yo 

I know it’s scary to have to face telling your parents you’re pregnant. I was 17 and still in high school when I got pregnant with my oldest daughter, and in my case, the baby’s father was no longer in the picture. First of all, confirm that you are pregnant with a home pregnancy test, or go to a pregnancy center for a free medical-grade pregnancy test. Many pregnancy centers can also do an ultrasound to confirm how far along in your pregnancy you are and give you an estimate due date. Once your pregnancy is confirmed, think about what you want to do. Do you want to raise the baby or do you feel 

Keep in your head that your family loves you. Although your parents may be upset, disappointed and even angry when they hear you're pregnant, they still love you.There is no perfect way to tell them your news. But here are some tips for making it less upsetting for both you and them. Choose the right time Don't tell your mum when she's dashing off to work. If possible, talk to your mum and dad at the same time. It is unfair to ask one of them to keep a secret. If your parents are very busy, or living apart, ask them when would be a good time to talk. Prepare the ground Tell your family you've 

There’s just no easy way to tell your parents about an unplanned pregnancy. I had to do this at 16, too. I put it off so long that I unknowingly complicated the entire issue for myself. I was sick at heart, in my mind, as well as physically since I knew what the reaction would be. So, I just blurted it out one night when I was alone with my mother and let her tell my father. Cowardly of me, but my father had spent many hours lecturing me about my behavior as soon as I hit high school. To make a long story short, it was as horrible as I’d expected. Tears, tears, tears! Being called a “failure,  

You might want to start by making a plan between you and your girlfriend, if you haven’t done so already. Before you tell your mom make a very detailed plan asking yourself and each other all of the hard questions: Are you going to keep the baby?If so, how will you support it?Will you both raise it together? Get married? Live together?Where will you live?Will you need help from friends and family and if so, what kind of help?How will you work?How much do you need to survive while supporting the baby?What happens if you both split up? (Because you are both young it is best to consider this a pos

How would you react if your 16-year-old daughter got pregnant?
How would you react if your 16-year-old daughter got pregnant? I wouldn't react if i didn't find-out about itIn the event that i was apprised of the exciting news i'd initially experience delight (babies are wonderful, human babies especially)Immediately on the heels of that rush of happy feelings would follow a range of concerns for the immediate and distant futureI'd then do my best to shut down my analytical mind long enough to offer my daughter the biggest, warmest daddy hug, and keep the rest of my brain on standby long enough to listen to her for at least a few days, to give her plenty of

Three weeks ago My wife sent me a text while I was at the supermarket asking me to get a pregnancy test for our 15 year old daughter as she was saying that she was late for her period. We thought that she had her dates wrong as she told us that she had not had unprotected sex. I brought the test home and gave it to my daughter, telling her to do it when her younger siblings were not around. a little later our daughter called my wife from the bathroom. As my wife was on the telephone I went instead and knocked on the door. When I entered my daughter just pointed at the test, a very clear two li 

A lifelong friend who was 16 YO got pregnant. She confided in me, knowing I knew her parents well, and asked me what she should do. We were both 16 YO and I thought to myself, if I definitively answer her question, I would get backlash from her parents. So, I asked her; “Well, without making any decision based on your parents reaction, what do you want to do”? Then, she said; “I’m asking you. I need you to tell me.” I knew no matter what answer I gave her, it would haunt me for the rest of my life and I didn’t want that responsibility. I told my friend that it is a decision that only she can m 

A few months ago, my 16-year-old cousin told me she was pregnant. The look on her face was a combination of fear, worry, and hopelessness. Immediately, other family members informed her of how she had ruined her life, made things harder for herself, and offered their opinions about what she should do. I had my first child unexpectedly when I was 19. And I know all too well that things are harder and at that age—you really aren’t equipped with the best tools just yet. I sat quietly as the family talked over this frightened girl and I saw so much of myself in her. Make no mistake; I understand that  

When I was 15 years old I was raped and had a baby a week after my 16th birthday. I was met with nothing but disgust and anger from my mother. Those 9 months were hard for me because I had already been through so much emotional turmoil but on top of that I had my mother constantly slut shaming me (like it was my fault for being raped) My relationship with my mother is nonexistent now because even though she wasn't a great mother to begin with, the stress and horrible behavior she put me through was the breaking point. I was so broken and so weak and instead of lifting me up, she kicked me when  

I was an informative and teaching parent. I informed both my daughters about sex and taught them how to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy and std's. If parents don't do that, they won't have done their daughters justice or fullfill their roles and duties as parents. Me, I told my 2 grown daughters who are 30 and 23 yo the truth about everything they needed to know about anything. Always! So when my oldest was 16 or 17, I found a birth control information, flyer under the couch. When I asked her about it, she was able to be honest and tell the truth. Her and her boyfriend of nearly 10 mo 

Well, I don’t have a 16 year old daughter (Obviously since I’m only 17), but if I did and found out she got pregnant, the first thing I’d do is ask her who’s the father. That might be an odd way of starting off the conversation, but I’d be curious to know if it was her boyfriend, if it was some random guy she met at a party, a friend she was experimenting with, or maybe she was raped and didn’t tell me. If she was raped or had sex with some random guy, I’d make sure she’d get tested for STDs. Then I’d ask her what she wants to do. If she wants to keep the baby, I’ll support her the best I can and  

I was raped by some people i thought I could trust as a teen. I can't tell you specifics because my rapists are still out there. So, let me tell you what happened when I found out I was pregnant. I was away from home for the first time. I was 17 in a foreign country for the first time in my life. My parents were literally a day away from me. Before I left, my mom took me to the doctor to get me on birth control. I guess because I wasn't far along, it didn't show i was pregnant. The whole time, I was waiting to start my new pill. Nothing happened. I went to someone i could trust and I told her e 

My first wife and I had been divorced but still in the middle of an ugly property (read money) dispute. My first wife wouldn’t walk across a room to spit on me if I were on fire. One day to my surprise she called me and we had a nice but “tense” chat. She finally told me that “your daughter” was pregnant at age 15 and that she had thrown her out of the house. There is a lot of back story here on the why of it but that is another post entirely. Surprised? Yes, at that point you can be angry, sure, but that doesn’t change a thing or help the situation though. A couple days passed and my darling d 

I don’t have a child yet, and I am much closer to being 16 than having a child that is 16 but I have thought about the subject before. First of all, before she is even 16, I would have made sure that she had a comprehensive sex education. I would have bought her condoms just in case. I would have also offered to make an appointment for her with her doctor if she wanted to be on birth control. I would also tell her that she should not fear telling me if an accident happen so we could rush to the pharmacy and get a plan B pill. I am pretty sure that if my daughter got pregnant, it would be a compl 

Why do some teenagers in the United States get pregnant?
I'm not a teenager but I think I've found the explanation. I've been taking birth control pills for several years. In Russia it works like this: you go to any pharmacy you like and buy pills that you need. And any amount you need. If you want to buy pills for the next several months - it's fine. They are not cheap and not too expensive. You don't need to have a prescription, documents, etc. - it's supposed that if you buy it, you know what it is and you need it. And then I came to the US. I was prepared to the fact that they don't sell here the exact pills I used to take so I found another one w 

It is probably due to poor sex education. I was raised in the UK and was given so called ‘sex education’ lessons at the age of 11. They were laughable and I honestly wonder if things have improved. This is what happened to me. The year 1968, I was 11, yes the wonderful swinging 60’s, hippies The Beatles and free love.  What a joke, I was in Wolverhampton, former armpit of the midlands, derelict houses, factories and a right dump.  We did have the Wolves football team however.  Slade and Led Zepplin were around so there was potential and we had our wonderful education system to help us along. I was at a 

Before I answer the actual question let me respond briefly to the many answers about birth control pills being hard to get and expensive. Those of you who came from places where it is available without prescription and cheap, can you tell me if it comes with information about the risks, and when it should not be used, and when it might be ineffective? Because if you also smoke, your risk of stroke just about doubles. So you shouldn't do both. Some antibiotics make them less effective. So if you are taking antibiotics you should add another method. And so on. How many people educate themselves a 

1. Teenage pregnancy is not only a problem in the US, but also in the rest of the world. It often is a question of sex-education whether or not the teen gets pregnant. The sex hormones in both males and females are highest in the teenage years and this accounts for the powerful sex drives in both males and females. But with the passion of wanting to make love, teenagers often forget to use their intellect. A complication factor may be the lack of experience. Prevention is always better than trying to fix things when it is too late (in the example here: she is pregnant). But this is what often  

Because they can. By the time we reach n-teen years old, our sexual organs become biologically mature enough to fully engage in sexual intercourse, and teenage girls become perfectly capable of carrying a fetus in their wombs. Girls are old enough to produce eggs, and guys are old enough to produce sperms. When a sperm and an egg fertilize, the result is a zygote…and then a fetus…and then a baby. Now does that mean they’re financially or emotionally capable of raising children? Absolutely not. Being sexually mature and financially mature are two different things. And this is why teenagers becom 

You really don't have to ask a scientist or a researcher about this. Just ask a teen. Speaking as a teenager, alot of my friends have sex because they like it and they don't think accidental pregnancy will happen to them. They do use protection (condoms, birth control, etc...) but they feel it's a great way to relieve stress, feel a close relationship with someone they care about, and it feels amazing. I myself am remaining abstinent because I like to think of myself as someone who doesn't do that sort of thing at this age and Its a high risk thing to do. I have a boyfriend, and I'll be honest 

think there are two reasons teen pregnancy is a lot higher in USA than most other wealthy democracties: Poverty / class-divisionCompared to just about any other wealthy democracy, USA has a large and poor underclass. Differences between the haves and the have-nots are larger in USA.  The simplest and most well-known measure of inequality is the GINI-index. Here's how a map of the world by GINI-index looks:  [Image-credit: Wikipedia] Now compare USA to other wealthy democracies and I believe the difference is pretty clear. Teenage pregnancies are a lot more common among the poor than among the wea 

It's not just in the US. The teenage pregnancy lies in other cities/ countries as well. Why are teens getting pregnant? …Because they are having unprotected sex. There's less of a shameful stigma associated with girls having sex these days. Sex is EVERYWHERE these days. No discretion. It's getting younger, and younger every decade. Also the teens and early twenty-something’s getting pregnant and having babies are much more common place. As there is also more social common place of single (unwed) mothers. It's not “TABU” as it once was. To make matters worse, girls with multiple children with multi 

In one word: Puritanism.In two words: Cultural Hypocrisy. In more words:When compared to the rest of the industrialized nations, the U.S. has a pathological relationship with sex: On the one hand it puts sex and sex appeal on everything from video games to alcohol commercials to television, little girls' dolls, football games, to engine component calendars.  Likewise, it hosts the planet's largest porn industry.  It's everywhere. On the other hand, it lives in religious shame of its obsession with sex and strives to live up to the impossible puritan ideology some of its early settlers brought w 

Hmm, this is an interesting question. Look at this guy.  I’d say he’s devilishly handsome and would make all the girls swoon. If he has a great personality then it’s game over. Look at this girl:  She’s gorgeous in my book. If she comes with a bit of intelligent conversation then you can believe that the guys will fall head over heels for her. As teenagers, adult feelings are just starting to surface. Guys are getting hard-ons and girls are getting wet. It’s a natural part of life. But, it’s taboo. Families don’t really talk about these things and the school system has a single class about safe sex. A si 

I am 14 and pregnant. How should I handle school?
Firstly, I’m sorry that people are saying so many horrible things. One of my best friends in Jr. High got pregnant at 15. She actually now has 4 kids, owns a home, has a great husband, has a photography business. Life isn’t over (as some seem to be saying) just because you got pregnant young! There are a few options, and I think…the hardest part is likely picking the one you want. Once you do that, it’s action, which I find way easier than making a decision. Here are my thoughts: a) continue on with school as you are. It might be difficult if people are mean in school, but remember your truth - t 

I don’t think I can provide you with the right answer because I don’t know anything about you but two things: 14 years old girlpregnantIt is really depends on so many factors. I will give you example from my perspective. For the background, I don’t live in US or other developed country. I grew up and still living at a developing democratic country in South East Asia dominated by moslem. I came from middle class family and my parents are devoted to their religion and I grew up with thise values instilled in my mind. My culture still upholds eastern values which means they can’t condone premarital 

Has the pregnancy been confirmed absolutely; if so how far progressed is it? Do you know who the father of the child is? Are your mum/dad (both) aware of the situation, and if so are they prepared to act as Grand-Parents, whilst you attend school, and look after baby; if so what is the problem? If both you and baby are healthy, and you are coping with the pregnancy to date, and the third condition above is available, I see no reason why you should need to abort the pregnancy. Being a mum is a big thing even when you are in your 20s, and it is painful and draining, particularly as you are still gro 

You're in a tough spot, no doubt. How you handle yourself in the next 2 years will define the rest of your life. You may not feel like you have any choices but you really do. The one thing you cannot do is procrastinate making decisions. Nature is going to bring you a baby - that's a FACT. The decisions you make about this situation are 100% under your control. You and your parents need to come up with a solid plan you can all live with. This doesn't have to be a disaster if you dont let it be a disaster.1) talk to your parents. 2) if the 3 of you decide to abort the baby, Planned Parenthood 

Congratulations on your upcoming bundle of joy! I’m assuming you’re choosing to embrace the role of motherhood since it sounds like you’re planning for the future. I’m sure few people have wished you congratulations about the baby. I know because I got pregnant at 15, so I’ve been there. I know how scared and lonely you probably feel. But life can be celebrated even when unplanned. First off, f*ck the haters out there. People are rude and ignorant. It cracks me up how many men chime in on teen pregnancy. They know NOTHING. You’re going to meet sooooo many rude people who will give you unsolicited 

Firstly I'm a male so my advice may not be the best. I am.the father of a teenage girl so I know how I would react. I won't get into scolding you or anything or that nature. Go to school, do not give up. Having a child and going to school will be a challenge. Life is a challenge it's what you do with it that is important. If you want the best chance for your kid then WORK HARD. Finish school, even get a degree or trade school whichever you want to do. Understand that the free time you once had for you friends will be taken up by this miracle of life and just hope they will adjust a little for y 

This would be so much easier to answer if you could give us more information: By handle school do you mean practically, like how to graduate, or do you mean emotionally? Are your parents aware and how have they responded? Are you in a larger city (which may have more alternative options for young moms)? Is anyone supporting you or are you on your own? Whatever the case, you must find a way to keep up with school and graduate. Continue going as long as possible and speak to the school and your teachers in advance to make arrangements for homework, tests, projects when it becomes difficult to be  

I myself am a 14 year old girl. I have absolutely no experience with this type of thing. But I might be able to give some input that could help. I myself am pro-choice. I personally would get an abortion. That's just my choice, though. If you want to keep the baby that is your decision to make, but It's going to be very very hard to keep going through high school and college while taking care of a baby. If your parents are supportive and want to be there for you and their grandchild then it will be easier, but you can't expect them to be supportive right away or even expect them to help with ra

But the reason being is that once i was in a situation. Where i thought i got a girl prego at 16. And i was so scared to tell my mom.

I’m really upset with some of these answers and I’m sorry you have to read them. You asked about school and a few people are telling you over and over to have an abortion. I’m sorry. I’m going to answer exactly what you asked for: If nobody at school knows yet, don’t tell them if you don’t want to, but start talking to the teachers you trust, and who may help you later on. When your classmates find out, ignore their opinions and gossip. They may talk, but they are not you neither are they in your shoes, ergo, they have no idea what they are talking about. Only you and your parents know what’s bes

How would you react if your 16-year-old daughter got pregnant? I wouldn't react if i didn't find-out about itIn the event that i was apprised of the exciting news i'd initially experience delight (babies are wonderful, human babies especially)Immediately on the heels of that rush of happy feelings would follow a range of concerns for the immediate and distant futureI'd then do my best to shut down my analytical mind long enough to offer my daughter the biggest, warmest daddy hug, and keep the rest of my brain on standby long enough to listen to her for at least a few days, to give her plenty of

Three weeks ago My wife sent me a text while I was at the supermarket asking me to get a pregnancy test for our 15 year old daughter as she was saying that she was late for her period. We thought that she had her dates wrong as she told us that she had not had unprotected sex. I brought the test home and gave it to my daughter, telling her to do it when her younger siblings were not around. a little later our daughter called my wife from the bathroom. As my wife was on the telephone I went instead and knocked on the door. When I entered my daughter just pointed at the test, a very clear two li 

A lifelong friend who was 16 YO got pregnant. She confided in me, knowing I knew her parents well, and asked me what she should do. We were both 16 YO and I thought to myself, if I definitively answer her question, I would get backlash from her parents. So, I asked her; “Well, without making any decision based on your parents reaction, what do you want to do”? Then, she said; “I’m asking you. I need you to tell me.” I knew no matter what answer I gave her, it would haunt me for the rest of my life and I didn’t want that responsibility. I told my friend that it is a decision that only she can m 

A few months ago, my 16-year-old cousin told me she was pregnant. The look on her face was a combination of fear, worry, and hopelessness. Immediately, other family members informed her of how she had ruined her life, made things harder for herself, and offered their opinions about what she should do. I had my first child unexpectedly when I was 19. And I know all too well that things are harder and at that age—you really aren’t equipped with the best tools just yet. I sat quietly as the family talked over this frightened girl and I saw so much of myself in her. Make no mistake; I understand that  

When I was 15 years old I was raped and had a baby a week after my 16th birthday. I was met with nothing but disgust and anger from my mother. Those 9 months were hard for me because I had already been through so much emotional turmoil but on top of that I had my mother constantly slut shaming me (like it was my fault for being raped) My relationship with my mother is nonexistent now because even though she wasn't a great mother to begin with, the stress and horrible behavior she put me through was the breaking point. I was so broken and so weak and instead of lifting me up, she kicked me when  

I was an informative and teaching parent. I informed both my daughters about sex and taught them how to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy and std's. If parents don't do that, they won't have done their daughters justice or fullfill their roles and duties as parents. Me, I told my 2 grown daughters who are 30 and 23 yo the truth about everything they needed to know about anything. Always! So when my oldest was 16 or 17, I found a birth control information, flyer under the couch. When I asked her about it, she was able to be honest and tell the truth. Her and her boyfriend of nearly 10 mo 

Well, I don’t have a 16 year old daughter (Obviously since I’m only 17), but if I did and found out she got pregnant, the first thing I’d do is ask her who’s the father. That might be an odd way of starting off the conversation, but I’d be curious to know if it was her boyfriend, if it was some random guy she met at a party, a friend she was experimenting with, or maybe she was raped and didn’t tell me. If she was raped or had sex with some random guy, I’d make sure she’d get tested for STDs. Then I’d ask her what she wants to do. If she wants to keep the baby, I’ll support her the best I can and  

I was raped by some people i thought I could trust as a teen. I can't tell you specifics because my rapists are still out there. So, let me tell you what happened when I found out I was pregnant. I was away from home for the first time. I was 17 in a foreign country for the first time in my life. My parents were literally a day away from me. Before I left, my mom took me to the doctor to get me on birth control. I guess because I wasn't far along, it didn't show i was pregnant. The whole time, I was waiting to start my new pill. Nothing happened. I went to someone i could trust and I told her e 

My first wife and I had been divorced but still in the middle of an ugly property (read money) dispute. My first wife wouldn’t walk across a room to spit on me if I were on fire. One day to my surprise she called me and we had a nice but “tense” chat. She finally told me that “your daughter” was pregnant at age 15 and that she had thrown her out of the house. There is a lot of back story here on the why of it but that is another post entirely. Surprised? Yes, at that point you can be angry, sure, but that doesn’t change a thing or help the situation though. A couple days passed and my darling d 

I don’t have a child yet, and I am much closer to being 16 than having a child that is 16 but I have thought about the subject before. First of all, before she is even 16, I would have made sure that she had a comprehensive sex education. I would have bought her condoms just in case. I would have also offered to make an appointment for her with her doctor if she wanted to be on birth control. I would also tell her that she should not fear telling me if an accident happen so we could rush to the pharmacy and get a plan B pill. I am pretty sure that if my daughter got pregnant, it would be a compl 

My period lasts me from 5days to 3+ weeks, every month, even though I’m on a pill that is supposed to stop my periods. They’re quite heavy too, and when they end come back within 5 days and stay for another 3 weeks. I’m 19. Should I be concerned?
What happens right before your first period?
How can I stop menstrual periods permanently?
I'm 39 years old and my period is ruining my sex life. I don't see my boyfriend very often, due to the fact that we don't live together, he is a full-time dad and has a very demanding job that prevents him from spending much time with me. My tubes are tied and I can't have anymore kids, so my period no longer serves a purpose for my life, as far as I'm concerned. Now it's just something that pisses me off to no avail. My boyfriend and I were trying to make plans for him to come see me soon, as in just a few days but my period decided to come just a few minutes ago and I'm pissed off extremely  

To stop periods permanently there are a lot of surgeries that can stop and reduce the flow of blood during menstruate cycle. One of those surgeries is removing uterus , which can stop periods permanently is also called as partial hysterectomy. Another surgery is endometrial ablation surgery , operated on uterus to destroy lining of uterus or endometrium, some women may have light bleeding after this or may just had stopped it permanently depends on particular person. These surgeries keep blood flow minimum by building up lining in the duration of cyclical hormone stimulation. But have side effec 

I would feel quite bad about offering you unsafe options, so I'll stick to reasonably safe medical procedures. First, many people find that birth control with continuous hormones stops or almost stops their periods. When I used hormonal IUDs (Mirena and Skyla) I had only a couple of very light episodes of bleeding a year. IUD, implant, hormonal shots, or taking a birth control pill and skipping the placebo week can all have this effect. Hormonal birth control is also very easy to obtain in most places. So that's probably your first line treatment. The downside is that it won't work for everyone 

It dipends on why you want to stop having periods. If you have relevant symptoms, you may consider going on hormonal birth control. The pill will indeed stop the period. You will still have a monthly bleeding that mimicks the period, but it’s not a period and it’s fully caused by the pill. Therefore it is supposed to occur without relevant symptoms. If you would prefer to avoid the hassle, you may ask your doctor to be put on a seasonal hormonal birth control pill, which has this bleeding limited to once every three months. If you are ill at ease with your period at a psychological level, this is 

Good luck finding someone to listen to you. That’s not me be snotty; that’s me being sincere. There is a HUGE problem in the medical community, especially the field of gynecology, in getting physicians to listen to women when we have menstrual problems or when we want to make decisions about taking permanent steps to prevent pregnancy or solve those problems. You will have to ‘shop around’ to find a doctor who will listen to you, and explain all of your options. Depending upon your age, I would estimate 80% that you contact will say “you are too young to make this decision”, or “you’ll change yo 

If you are under 45 or so, the only way to stop having menstrual periods entirely, ever again, is to have a total hysterectomy, which is the surgical removal of your ovaries and uterus, but that will also eliminate your ability to have children, ever. Menopause is the natural cessation of the menstrual cycle; most women enter menopause somewhere between 45 to 55, some earlier, some later. The medical community seems in general to be very, VERY reluctant to provide total hysterectomies for women under 40, unless it is a medical emergency or a seriously health-endangering, life-threatening medical 

There are a number of ways to stop you from having visible periods. These are dependent on the body of the woman, though. Contraceptive pills. If you take the active pills continually without taking the sugar pills at the end of a pack, you might skip your period altogether. This is normal and not an unheard of method that womem employ to stay period free for a long time.LARCs. Like hormonal IUDs and implants. Some women experience no periods after the body gets used to the device and the constant flow of hormones from them. IUDs can last anywhere from 3 to 5 years, depending on which device yo

If you have no intention to be pregnant now or in the future, there's a procedure called Endometrial Ablation. It can reduce your periods or completely make then disappear.  The Mirena IUD usually stops your periods for the 5 years that it lasts. And after that, you can always replace it with another Mirena IUD.  Other option is continuous intake of contraceptive pills. Each package, has 28 pills. 21 weeks of hormones, and 7 weeks of placebos. You can start a new package on day 22, skipping the placebos. In order to do this for prolonged periods of time, you need to go to your doctor or midwife  

Continuously taking birth control (skipping the placebo pills) may be a temporary solution for you. The pill maintains your hormones at a certain level. When you take the placebos you have a ‘withdrawal bleed’ which mimics a period but is not the same thing. It is perfectly safe to skip this. I have been doing this for years and it has made my life 100000000000x better. No more pain, though some women experience spotting every now and then. I would also love to stop my periods forever, but I doubt any doctor would listen to me. On a side note, if you suffer from severe period pain / other unple 

There are guaranteed ways: remove the uterus or ovaries by surgery, but I guess that’s a bit too drastic. There are forms of hormonal birth control that often stop the periods altogether, but there is no guarantee it will work this way for you. You can continuously take contraceptive pills, but often at some moths you will start to bleed anyway until you stop for a week and bleed it out, then start using it again. A hormonal IUD often stops periods in women, by causing the uterine lining to break down completely and not build up again, but it does not work that way for everyone. Then birth cont 

Who can I talk to about stopping my period completely permanently?
How do I know when my period is coming?
How indeed! In all my life, I can remember perhaps two or three times when I knew my period was about to start. It's never ever been regular. All other times, which is about 23*11 times, it was “SURPRISE, LOSER! HERE'S A BIT/LOT OF CELEBRATION PAINT ONTO YOUR UNDERWEAR AND CLOTHES AND BED/CHAIR!” The best yet was when I went to a friend's house and they sat me on a chair covered with white fur. Sitting on white spells trouble, everyone knows it. I felt the flood gates open in a sudden instant and just managed to dash into the restroom and pull my pants off. Then my body staged a chainsaw massacre 

Hm well it can depend on the person. (Some of these might be a little TMI but it's helpful) I'm assuming that this is your first period so I'll start with those symptoms or signs first (From my own knowledge and personal experiences/friends experiences). For my first period, I had a mild stomach ache whilst I was at school (13), I had shrugged it off as hunger since it was near lunchtime. By the time I'd gone to the toilet on our lunch break I ended up having a very startling surprise.

Are you expecting your first period, or do you want to know how to tell when your period should come each time it does? There are far too many factors varying across individuals for any of us to be able to help you in any truly meaningful way, whether it is the former or the latter. The best thing we can do is give you experiences that we are familiar with, and you will have a catalogue of signs you can use to observe your own body. The former can depend on your genetics, your weight or your environment, to name a few broad factors. I had no idea that I was expecting my first period, I don't rec 

It varies from woman to woman. When a woman starts getting her menses it is usually so unpredictable that there isn’t much forewarning. It also takes a few cycles to recognize a pattern. I used to get a single pimple about a day or 2 before my irregular cycle would start, and maybe I’d start really craving rare beef, like walk the cow by me and let me slice off my dinner rare. The very idea of chocolate would make me nauseous though. Then my periods got hellish in my mid-30’s. I’d know because suddenly it would feel like someone tried to rip me open from sternum to vagina with a rusted spoon and  

By keeping a calendar. Start by marking the first day of menstruation on a diary or on your phone's calendar. After 3–4 months you can count how many days are there between one menstruation and the next. We are taught that they should be 28, but in truth the cycle’s length varies between 21 and 40 days. For instance, you marked off three cycles, one was 31 days long, the other two were 32 days long (cycle duration fluctuates a bit), based on this observation you can guess your cycle is about 31 or 32 days long. Then you can guess when you should have your next menstruations. You can also find a

If it starts earlier or later, count out how many days that is, and use that as a basis for predicting your next menses. It will probably be consistent for you.

What counts as a “regular menstrual cycle?” Like, same exact day every month or just around the same time or every x amount of days? I’ve had my period for 6 years and I still never know the exact day I’ll start.
Thanks for the A2A, Caroline. “Regular” doesn’t have an exact definition - basically what it’s asking is, is your cycle predictable? Some women’s cycles are almost like clockwork; they know that every 28 days - or every 27 days or 30 days or whatever - they’ll have their period. That would certainly be “regular”. Some even know it will start around the same time of day, every X number of days. Even knowing that it will always be X number of days, plus or minus 1, is pretty regular though, in the sense that it’s predictable. (It will never be the exact same calendar day each month - for instance, a 

Yes, something like ‘around the same time every x amount of days’. You are regular if your cycle varies by max 3 days around an average, and only rarely more. Months are irrelevant, just count the number of days from the start of your period until the day before the start of your next period. One ‘off’ cycle (one or two weeks longer than usual) does not make you irregular. It is perfectly normal to not know the exact day you start. I have worried way too much about this when I was younger, that I ‘didn’t know exactly how long my cycle was because it was never the same’. No natural cycle is perf 

Our bodies aren’t machines, so some minor variation is to be expected. If periods were only considered regular if you could set your clock by them, few women would be considered to have regular periods. My cycles tend to range from 27 to 32 days in length. I know roughly when to expect my periods, but a day or two early or late is neither unusual nor cause for concern. A normal menstrual cycle lasts 28 days, plus or minus seven days. Menstrual bleeding is considered irregular if it occurs more frequently than every 21 days or lasts longer than 8 days. Missed, early, or late periods are also cons 

We teach natural family planning and aren’t concerned about how long cycles are, as long as they progress normally. That is, if it varies a few days or a week, that’s no reason to go on contraceptive pills to “regulate” them. They just make you bleed on time without solving any underlying problem. If you want to know if you are normal, and when your new cycle will start, learn to observe and chart your fertility symptoms. Once you see a BBT rise, you can count forward in time for two weeks (or whatever is normal for you) and circle that on your calendar. You will probably see a one-day dip in B 

Menstrual cycles change throughout a woman’s life until menopause. A “regular” cycle is one that has a normal ovulation (release of an egg) followed by menstrual flow (if no conception occurs) about 14 days later. After puberty, the ovary may not really release eggs on a reliable, monthly schedule for several years (4–10 years, in fact); so menstrual cycles in teens can range from 3 weeks to several months apart. After that, if there are no complicating factors like obesity or sickness or stress or hormonal problems, a woman should have a cycle most months on a fairly regular basis for about 2 

Regular just means “regularly occurring, for you.” The average for most women is a 28-day cycle. Your cycle could be fewer days or more days than 28, but you can count on it occurring (for example) every 27 days, or every 29 days, etc. I was the same as you: I never knew exactly when mine would start because my cycles were so irregular. Sometimes 28 days apart (Day One is the day your period starts, so you count from Day One to Day One), sometimes 26 or 27, sometimes 29 or 30… I just never knew exactly. It’s frustrating when your periods are irregular. If I were a young woman now, I think I woul 

Regular menstrual cycle for many is like same day every month but for anyone like woman like you and me whose date does not remain same every month, we should be concerned about our menstrual cycle length.

While some women will get their period every x amount of days, many will have slight variations, eg 28–29 or 29–30, which still count as being regular. Less than 25 or more than 35 are outside the norm but still may be regular. Irregular periods would be, for example 26 days one month and 34 days the next. Irregular periods may be indicative of anovulation, but that diagnosis requires further testing. Anovulation may hinder conception, but not always. If one is not interested in pregnancy at the time, oral contraceptive pills can be used to try to regulate the periods. 101 views · Answer requested by CarolineKateřina Šimková, studied at Gymnázium Dr. Karla Polesného, Znojmo (2011)Answered 1 year ago · Author has 263 answers and 79.9K answer views

Normal menstrual cycle means having menstruation every 21–35 days and it should last between 2–12 days. The 28 days long cycle with 7 days of period, is average of those numbers. In reality there are some women who have cycle just 21 days and 2–3 days of period, and some who have cycle 35 days and period 7–12 days. Anything else is considered abnormal, though I heard of some women who had cycle 35–40 days (and 10–14 days of period) with no problems. You need to start counting what is average for you.

The number of days is the major count for regular periods. Monitor your menses for over 3 months, if they all happened at an approximate number of days (plus or minus 1) then the cycle can be called “regular.” Due to the different number of days in many months, even a “regular” cycle will almost always have the menses on different days from the last ones. NOTE: Menstrual Cycle begins with ovulation and ends in menstruation. From the beginning of one menses to the beginning of another can be counted as a menstrual cycle and at the middle of every of this calculation is usually when ovulation occur

My MIL and I don't really get along either. She wanted to be be around for the birth of my daughter, but when she was visiting in summer a month before giving birth, I made sure to tell her I only wanted my husband and MY mom there with me. She told me I shouldn't be dramatic and that giving birth isn't as bad as they say. She even convinced my husband that I shouldn't get an epidural and that contractions are not painful. She said she just laid in her bed and would check her watch occasionally and only got embarrassed when the doctor asked if a student could be present. Well, after 18 hours o

I don’t think it’s fair that one person should be able to make unilateral decisions that affect the both of you; on any topic or activity. However, in this case, there is more weight behind your wishes. The both of you should be capable of discussing this like mature adults and come to an agreement that considers what’s at stake. I doubt that your husband’s desire to have his mother present is stronger than your desire to not have her watching you during a very personal and vulnerable time.

I was disappointed, but I hid it from her and left the room, because, again, it was her decision, and hers only, who she wanted there. When my twin grandsons were born, their mother didn’t even bother to let me know she was in labour, or to tell me the boys had actua 

Your husband is absolutely wrong. Yes, it may be his baby, but YOU must be comfortable and feel safe while delivering it.

My MIL is a nice person and I generally get along with her, as long as it's not for more than an hour at a time. She is also fixated on taking pictures. With our first son, she asked and we allowed her into the delivery room. She occasionally made a nuisance of herself and annoyed th

My parents are both very ahead of their time regarding gender roles. My mother is a very forceful woman and my father is a guy who always helped around the house. I was surprised because it seemed so old fashioned. I said to my Mum, “surely the hospital was letting men in by then.” “Oh no,” she said. “I didn't want him there.” Mystified I asked why and my stunning and immaculately styl 

If you do not get along I cant imagine anything worse. When I had my first child it was like a party in my room even my sister was there it was amazing and all of the support was wonderful.There was laughter and tears and a true bonding of all the people in the room,it brought everyone closer for a time. When my daughter gave birth, I and the other grandma to be were both in the room. She was polite and tried to give my daughter privacy while she was being checked by nurses and doctors etc. She would turn her back or walk out into the hallway.This woman and I didnt really get along,no arguing o 

I have read most of these answers, and they are all spot on…. but… there is one more point that you should raise with your husband. (BTW, I think your husband is not only wrong, but kind of an idiot for turning your medical procedure into a way to make his mommy happy.) It could be potentially dangerous for both you and the baby to have a person that you don’t get along with in the room. If you and MIL have any kind of personality clash, it will take one of the most stressful situations that you are ever likely to experience, and pump it full of steroids. Stress is dangerous for both mother an 

I know there are already plenty of answers to this question, but I feel compelled to add my perspective as a certified Doula and student Nurse on a Nurse-Midwife track. Short answer: NO, he is not right. I am not negating the profound experience of becoming a father and the importance of paternal involvement, but his body is not on the line here. Giving birth will likely be one of the most significant and challenging events in your lifetime, and it is of UTMOST importance that as a laboring mother, you feel as safe, supported, and comfortable as possible. The individuals present during your la 

My in laws are trying to bribe us (with a new truck) to give them a grandchild. My husband is now on board and wants me to have a baby too. How can I get them to stop pressuring me?
Tell your husband it won't be a truck for him but an SUV for you. Then tell both your husband and the grandparents that babies are an ongoing cost so you will need x amount of money each week for a minimum if 18 years. Let the grandparents know that since legally they aren't responsible for raising a grandchild that you will need to have their weekly contribution in writing and with cost of living adjustments to match the ones sent out by the state each year. Then tell the grandparents they will need to hire an accountant who can certify they have enough resources to take care of both themselve 

Wow, I just scrolled through about 6 pages of scorched earth rhetoric penned along the lines of “Burn those bribing Mother-Trucking in-laws at the stake, and throw their son onto the flaming heap afterwards” . While I agree with the basic premise that YOU are the primary arbiter for what is best for you, and while I can also see how you might be outraged /offended/upset that your in-laws are interfering with your life/ life-plan. Indeed nearly everyone today would agree tha only YOU and maybe, perhaps, your significant other ought to be allowed to exercise your prerogative as pertains to if an 

Well, at this point now your bigger issue is how do you get your husband to stop trying to get you pregnant before you’re ready. A baby is a monster 24/7 effort without a break. Will those grandparents pay for the baby’s food,diapers, formula, toys, tutoring-college? Will they really babysit whenever you need a break? And for how long? Talk is cheap, babies are full-time care. That may not even matter, them offering up babysitting. My baby used to cry when I left him even to go shopping. It was unrelenting and the biggest problem: You love this baby so much it completely takes over your life a 

I guess no one thought that a child needs to be loved and wanted by the parents and not made to be a burden. Long term if you don't present that, you just end up with a broken home. If you don't want the child at this point in your life tell them. You're not ready for it. The depression alone you'd have to deal with being forced to carry a child and pretend it is what you want is just as damaging and long term will only lead to a mentally ill/unstable childhood into their adult life. Let alone the dangers of post partum depression on the mother. Be fair to you above all, but if you do decide t 

What is up with your in-laws? Are they in some Johnny Appleseed competition with their peers? You and your husband do not owe them grandchildren, and especially not to order. They could offer you a million dollars cash and it would still be insane to agree to this. Children will change your life permanently and affect your marriage in ways you may not yet be aware of. Even if you know you want children eventually, eventually is the key word. This would also be a gateway to more interference on the in-laws’ part. Not to mention if they have a strong preference for a boy and you conceive a girl in 

Short but rude answer - hysterectomy. (If you really never want to have kids. Never. Ever.) But longer and a bit less good answer - your body is YOURS. You are not a baby factory to make their ‘dream baby’ come true. Besides, you are NOT married to in-laws, so by no means do they have any rights to press, coerce, bribe or otherwise convince you into having or doing something you definitely don’t want to do. And beware of the ‘oops, the condom has broken’ trick… I don’t know your circumstances - whether you are employed, self-employed, entrepreneur or jobless, but those also play a decisive facto 

So, YOU get pregnant, carry a baby around for 9 months, have ALL the labor and they think the best thing they can give you is a TRUCK? Tell them you want a trip for one to Europe and you’ll consider it. Or, some high end jewelry. A few spa days, maybe. You get the idea. If you agree to a truck, who is going to have their fat ass in the driver seat 90% of the time? Some bribe. (Or, maybe, you think it’s a great gift.) You have every right to tell all these selfish morons NO. Tell them you are not ready to have a baby and it is your decision as well as your husbands. You are going to do most of t 

Wow baby by bribery. You need to talk to your husband about how YOU feel but before that ASK yourself how you feel, because you may be holding out in protest to pressure and no other reason and not thinking about the complete future . I’m not telling you what to do, it’s your call, but here is how I’d think When Do I want children? For me having already had them at 20 and 25 and having 8 grandchildren and one great grandchild by age 69. I can say I am not too old to have a more personal relationship with my grandchildren and that is fantastic. I wasn’t too old to babysit them as babies I had en

Everyone here comments that you should have a talk, “sit your husband down “. Wrong. For me, this is a great reason to divorce. He wants that truck and he will do anything in his power to obtain it no matter what you end up going through. This includes broken condoms and not keeping it in after lying that he will keep it in. File for divorce immediately and find a proper husband with civilised parents who will not force you to do things you don't want or interefere with your decisions concerning your body. You think that divorce will be painful? Think how painful it would be to actually give bir 

Oh Wow! First of all it’s your body that will be carrying the child. After six months you could barely get into the truck. Having a child is a life long commitment. This is one of the most selfish things I’ve heard of. Will you be the one taking care of the child? A baby takes all kinds of work, a toll on your body, you don’t get much sleep. When you have a baby your life changes forever. Trucks can breakdown, get wrecked, then you get another vehicle. Children stay with you forever. You love them, you worry about them, you take care of them, you teach them the difference between right and wro 

What is usually considered husband material?
I know what doesn’t. Reverse the bold for good. Men who are disrespectful. They talk and disseminate negative things about other people, themselves and about their partner. Their lives are examples and experiments of embarrassment and social faux pas. They want to be respected and goes around thinking ‘respect is earned’. Actually, ‘respect is given where is due’. They get away with their peers but not by their higher ups and bosses. And that’s why they are not respected but couldn’t understand why. The actual ‘big wigs’ just see them as a joke and talks fluff. They soon will find out the hard 

These are the 10 qualities you need to look for in a man, the ones that tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that he’s the one and this is it and he  1. He loves your good qualities, and accepts the bad.  Without making you feel guilty for having flaws.  You don’t need to hide your true self from him and put on a front in order to be what you think he wants. You can share your true self and be vulnerable and feel safe doing so, knowing that if anything it will make him feel even closer to you.  2. He is there for you when you need him, even if it’s inconvenient for him.  A partnership 

My perspective puts faith first. After that, you have to become your own man and live intentionally. I wrote an article a few years back that tries to explain my ideal model of marriage and how the roles intertwine and weave together. I’ll paste it here: Ballroom Dancing: My Ideal Model for a Relationship To me? Ballroom dancing is the most beautiful and sublime expression of a masculine/feminine relationship. It's the metaphor I reach for whenever I try to discuss what I believe to be the perfect harmony between the energies a man and a woman can bring together. The man is the leader. This does n

Every girl dreams of her prince charming, the perfect guy for her who will take her into her magical dream world full of love. She wants him to be the best for her. Of course, no single guy is perfect or possesses all the qualities a girl dreams about, but trying a bit to incorporate a few good qualities goes a long way and make your relationship better and your life happier. And pleasing a girl is not as difficult as all you guys think. All they care for is a little attention, love and care.

I dated a man for 5 years and he could never put me as his priority. I met my husband through our parents (arranged marriage) and in 15 minutes, I could see that he was a man I could see having a future with. I don't know what makes good husband material, but here is what makes my husband the best person to share my life with. 1. He is invested in the relationship: whatever decision he takes, he will always check with me first. That shows that he sees me as a functioning, thinking and valuable part of the duo, who's opinions on his decisions matter. We never take decisions for the relationship w 

It happened 4 years back while I was working with Philips, India. There was this young chap, Rohan, 25 something, who recently got married. On his first day at the office after his marriage vacation, he got some sweets to share with all of us. We are some 120 people on the floor. Once we received the email “Wedding sweets at my desk. Please help yourself.”, all of us rushed to his desk. The crowd thickened at his desk and I had to wait for my turn while listening to the people congratulating him. All women were like ‘Rohan! Congratulations.’,’Rohan! All the best’...blah blah..but I saw most men  

They must have enough strength! (not talking about erection but ability to control the feeling of excitement &amp; attraction towards other women)Those who make good sons. (this is the basic condition to be a good husband)Those who don't make false promises during the honeymoon phase. (“I will keep you like a princess!” Just treat her with love.)Who won't visit their inlaws like a newly crowned Prince. (but like a son)Sex is in a part of their mind but not filled in every corner of it!

Men who remain calm in a crisis No matter who you are married life will be full of storms that you’ll have to weather together. Life happens. Job losses, death, health issues — all these things will affect you both at some point and the type of guy who makes a great husband is one who knows that panic is not a strategy. Someone who can keep calm and stay on your side, knowing that you two can support each other through anything is the only kind of man worth having. Men who are family people One of the best indicators that he’s husband material is that he is close to his family and treats them wel 

Why do people improve themselves after a divorce but not during the marriage?
What is the most difficult thing after marriage?
Being yourself. I found being myself the most difficult thing after marriage. If you have come across some of my other answers, you would know that my husband has a huge family (parents and 5 siblings). Though the siblings live independently with their families, our house is the the place for family get together(s) pretty much every weekend and sometimes weekdays too. When I got married, that too being an arranged marriage, which I was barely ready for, I didn’t know what to do / how to do anything. I was having a fear of being judged constantly. So, I never said NO to anything. I didn’t know if i

Couple of days ago, I read an answer on Quora regarding life after marriage. She was anonymous, and had shared how her life changed after marriage. It was touching. The story was more or less similar to the phases of a person’s life. (Here I am talking about phase of life, your experience with marriage could be different.) You get married at the proper age. ( Remember, this is the age decided by the society, and your parents.) Initial years, there is so much love, so much romance, so much sex. You love everything about your partner. With time, the romance starts to fade away. You don’t find anythin 

I can only speak for my own relationships - but I believe respect is one of the most difficult to maintain. Once that falls off so does the trust and love for the other. It only has to start with one partner speaking disparagingly towards the other and in time the better partner tires of it and cannot keep taking the abuse. This leaves to separation and finally divorce. If a psychologist is employed to relationship counsel, they may encourage the abused partner to leave, rather than keep submitting to such every single day. Lack of respect can start out as simple as seeing another’s flaws and f 

Just within three days after my Marriage I came here with my husband to build my new nest. Initial days all are difficult things only. Cooking, cleaning, sleeping, every thing!! For me identifying the provisions was a big task. Especially semolina.(Rava,suji) Upma, idli and other items where all these ravaas are used. All are different. But I could not recognise what rava for what purpose. They all looked same to me. I made upma with idli rava.on my first day after marriage. My darling husband ate it expressing navarasas in his face. But didn't tell anything. Not because of love on me. He also c 

When my wife and I dated we hated the hours we were apart. Oh, and couldn’t keep our hands off each other when we were together. But then, that’s another story. I’d drop her off at her parent’s house. Walk her to the door. Kiss her goodnight on the porch. Not go in because her dad still wasn’t exactly thrilled I was stealing his 20 year old daughter. And ache until I’d see her again the next evening after school and work. Then we married. And I didn’t need to drop her off and leave. We were together for dinner. After dinner. When we went to sleep. When we woke up. All day, every day on the weekends  

I have been married for more than two years. I am a happy husband with a lovely wife and together we rock. Its like we are still living in without marriage.  The most difficult thing you ask. Ill tell you a story- Two ladies in their mid 50's are sitting together and chating. 1st Lady: hows your daughter and son in law? 2nd Lady: my daughter is happy and blessed. My son in law is so nice and humble. Always there to help us and come here on every weekend with our daughter. Come to visit us if we are not well. Always take care of our daughter and her happiness. Do what makes her happy and listen to h 

Let me share about my own marriage, and the reason I am going anonymous is to protect the privacy of people related . I married a person of whom I knew little. As is common in middle class Indian households, my marriage became a priority even before I completed my studies. I had someone in my mind but I couldn’t convince myself to marry against my parent’s wishes .And then I met my now husband through a matrimonial website . It was he who contacted us first . I was impressed by his manners at the first instance itself. His soft and soothing tone made me feel he was the man for me even before we me 

When you become husband and wife, and you now live together if you didn’t live together prior to your marriage, learning each other’s idiosyncrasies, routines and demeanor can be difficult. In my situation, learning that my spouse and I didn’t need to end the night by going to bed at the same time, is one. I sometimes like to stay up late on a Friday or Saturday night and watch an old movie for instance, or read in bed. My spouse goes to bed at the SAME time (early) every night even on vacation. He does not like the bedside lamp on while he tries to sleep, so I’ve stopped reading in bed. These  

Each one of us is excited before marriage. First night, honeymoon, romance, sex, intimacy, kisses, cuddling, caressing and what not. (This is why we give preference to looks) Nothing wrong in excitement, it is the key to a happy and fulfilled life. But does anyone think about the differences in opinions, fights, compromises, resistance and adjustments you are ought to face after marriage? More or less, we tend to ignore this aspect. (This is the reason we ignore compatibility, behaviour, nature, goals, aspirations of a person)  You are expecting a delicious and good looking cake, but don't have any id

What should I do? My GF is saying that either we get married or she will dump me. We have a 7-year relationship but I'm still not ready to get married. I love her but she is leaving me unless we arrange a wedding in the next 3 months.
Every relationship gets to a point where you decide to get married or break up. Both of you need to break up. I was in your girlfriend’s shoes. Thankfully I wasted 2, not 7 years of my life with a guy. Those types are never serious nor ready for that level of commitment but too scared of being alone. Same thing; had the DTR with him. Later he surprised me with a beautiful proposal, but shortly after, the engagement was extremely stressful; nothing changed. One day he’s like yes let’s get married and next day oh I’m not sure. It was exhausting. Wedding planning helped me get away from that stress  

Been married several times and I’ve got to give you two ends of the spectrum. On one hand, marriage is for suckers. I mean you’ve been with her for 7 years. What have you not done that you can only do in a marriage? File joint taxes? Guarantee each other’s inheritance? Visit in the hospital? Get on the other’s insurance plan? All stupid reasons to get married. You mentioned something about different countries? Immigration is actually a good reason to get married. Other than that, a cynic would say it sounds like she’s got other plans for you or your fortunes. He’d say “If I was in your shoes, I’ 

My grandma had a saying for this. “Shit. Or get off the pot.” If you don’t know that you want to marry a woman after 7 years (!) of being in a relationship, then you need to figure out your mind and fast. I told my (now) husband after less than a year of dating that I was going to have to make a job decision in the next few months. I needed to have a firm decision from him on whether or not we were going to get married or not before I decided to stay where we were living at the time or move back to be closer to my family. I was not staying without a ring on my finger, or at least a firm propos 

Your gf said that to you? You mean your “girlfriend”? 7 years, and she's still your “gf”. Wow! Seven years she's been acting like your wife, you've been treating her like a wife. Sleeping in her bed each night, nursing you through sickness, washing your clothes, sucking your dick…. 7 fuckin' years you've been sucking the youth out of her and you don't respect that woman enough to ASK HER to honor you by becoming your wife.., and she wants to get married. She should have left you a long time ago. You are abusive and self-centered. If after 7 years you “are not ready”, then you really need to give her 

I had a fiancé just like you. He wasn’t ready after many years, almost 7. I one day got sick of his not being ready to just grow up and figure out what he wanted in life and I left him. Two years later (after being with HIM for 7) I was not only married, I was pregnant. No joke. So all these years later, I am happily married to someone else with a child. Coincidentally, my ex-fiancé lives 7 blocks from my new house. We stayed friends on FB, and I got a little concerned about the fact that we both live in the same small town. I looked up his address, wanting to be sure I wasn’t going to run int 

Wow this sounds familiar. I also had a 7-year relationship, in which she wanted to get married and I “wasn’t ready to.” I have to say, your girlfriend is being pretty kind, respectful, and vulnerable to express her needs to you. My girlfriend simply got frustrated, and ended the relationship. In fact, I think most women would just leave. What you have to understand is that your girlfriend loves you, but she also has important life goals which include marriage and probably family. These are very important to her. What you should ask yourself is “Why am I not ready?” For me, there were some important as 

This is a tough &amp; hard question to answer since so many variables can affect you &amp; your decision so I’m just going to try and do this on a basic and “Man to Man” kind of talk. As you’ve said, you have a 7 year long relationship and I will presume that you &amp; her are “In Love” , that you both do truly care for one another and enjoy time spent with each other and consider the past 7+ years a good investment of time. You then need to ask yourself “Why am I not ‘Ready’ for Marriage”? What is holding you back ? What are you afraid of ? What else do you feel you need to do before you feel like you wil 

I knew a guy once that was in a 5 year relationship but he just wasn’t ready to “settle down”. I talked with him a bunch of times about it because he was such a nice and kind guy and the girl was the love of his life and he would only ever get married and have children with her, he said. He couldn’t explain why not now. She was patient and seemed to be okay with the arrangement though. Fast forward 6 years. Whatever barrier makes the thought of being committed so impossible to him has not diminished. She is now in her late-ish 30s and he knows she wants kids. So he tells her she should forget h 

This is such a great question and I’m so glad you made the decision to ask it. NEVER let someone pressure you into marriage! PERIOD! Marriage is a TREMENDOUS commitment and an AWESOME responsibility! If you are not ready, you are NOT READY! NO ONE should pressure someone into marriage and, quite frankly, no one should WANT to pressure someone into marriage! People who want to get married, but are with a partner who feels they are not ready, can ALWAYS leave and go meet someone else, but NO ONE should ever pressure someone into getting married! Let me offer you some thoughts. Many women and men  

Generally, I think giving ultimatums are distasteful. However, context matters, and in the context of a 7 year relationship, I don't think its particularly unreasonable. What you need to do is to be honest with yourself. Question 1: Do you want to marry her? Possible answers: No. If this is your answer, I think its obvious that you have an irreconcilable difference. Your relationship is over, maybe it even lasted too long. You have to accept this and move on, and allow her move on.Maybe/I'm not sure. If this is your answer, we'll come back to that shortly.Yes, but not in 3 months. This also requir

What would you do if your best friend stole your husband?
My answer may sound brutal but I am not apologizing if you are hurt by my rant because it needs to be said and you need to hear it. I would do absolutely nothing whether it was my best friend or a family member. Well, I would probably never speak to him or her again except during the divorce proceedings which I would instigate. No one can STEAL your husband. He isn't a damned toaster that she stuck under her coat and ran out the door with. If your husband is sleeping with another woman, if he left you for another woman, if he married another woman, it isn't because she stole him from you! It is b 

What would I do? I would marry her husband …..and I did just that. We have now been married for almost 41 years. Back on January 1, 1979, my friend and my then husband approached me and told me that she was leaving her husband and he (my then husband) was leaving me for her. My husband told me he didn't love me anymore….after 4.5 years of marriage, having a six month old son and buying our first house. I was upset and hurt. Her husband, who had just been discharged from the Navy and had a four year old daughter and two year old son with her…. was also hurt.. Being just out of the Navy, he was n 

Im not married but i still wanted to answer this question.. Id be mad and i aint even gonna lie i would probably do something to F with her life like she did mine. Some ppl might say hes the one i should be mad at. But not true, they both are responsible. But her being my best friend, one who i share all the dirty intimate stories that happen between me and my husband with . Shes the one i talk to about the problems in our marriage. Shes supposed to be the one i can count on to have my back if she ever saw another woman flirting with my husband or saw him out with another woman. Shes supposed t 

I’m still a teenager so I’m not thinking about marriage. With that being said, I’ll answer the question as : What would you do if your best friend stole your boyfriend? Well for starters, that would depend if I dated him while I knew she liked him orIf she never liked him and wanted to do it because she stopped liking me.For Reason 1, I would be mad but not steam coming outing my ears mad. Here’s why. If she is my best friend, she would’ve known that I liked him and I would’ve known that she liked him. Now, if the guy and I started dating she would be the first person to know. In addition, she w 

What do you mean “to steal” your husband? that means you were married to that person, probably with kids, then your husband Divorce you to go and marry your best friend? is that what you mean? or you mean, while still married your husband was sleeping with your best friend? Although the bigger fight is with my husband not with her, because he is the one i vowed to be with, to love and to share every bit of me with till eternity, so why should you do that?! Anyway, for the type of person i am, my friend will not do either of that to me. Not because she’s not thinking of it, but we have had disc 

I’m not married or attracted to men, but this question is hypothetical anyways. If my best friend, or anyone, stole my spouse from me, I’d call the cops and have them arrested. Operator: 9–1–1, what’s your emergency? Me: There’s been a theft! Operator: Okay sir, I’ll send a police officer to your address. Can you tell me what was stolen? Me: My husband. Operator: Your… your husband? Me: Yes. Operator: I’m sorry, but I don’t understand. Me: Well, the hypothetical question specifies I have a husband. It’s the 21st century already, you shouldn’t find it that difficult to understand. Operator: No I understo 

Interesting question: Firstly, folks, be wary of whom you call “friend” and whom you let in your house. Old folk in ‘Bama used to say “don't keep a revolving door”. It's true. Once in a blue moon, my husband and I have a friend over, but in general, we're quiet folk. We feel our home is a sanctuary from the varying energies of folk. And we like it that way. But back to this hypothetical question: I wouldn't have to do anything because karma would bite her AND him. It may sound strange, but all my life, those who sought to do evil or did do bad things towards me, I would later found out were douse 

This happened to my next door neighbor. We both moved into this neighborhood within a couple of months of each other. She went home for lunch one day and found her husband in bed with her bestfriend. At the time, their son was about 12 years old. The kid seemed like a nice kid but you can tell that something is different about him. The neighborhood parents would not allow their children to play with him without adult supervision. They also did not allow their kids to go to his house and it didn’t matter even if his parents were home. They seemed like a nice couple, so in love, constantly holdin 

Hello. If my best friend stole my husband it would break my heart and make me cry and then I’ll be really angry for a while. But I wouldn’t stay angry. She deserves finally have a good guy in her life and if she makes my husband truly happy then I would want him to be happy like I would want her to be. It may sound odd but we’re talking what if’s. I love them both but I won’t stay friends with an ex (it’s something I already do)and I wouldn’t want to stay with a friend who goes after her best friends husband.

well the way i see it, lets forget about your best friend for a second, your best friend is not married to you, you are not sharing your life with your best friend, you are not growing old and having kids with your best friend. you married your husband, your husband married you. made promises. to be loyal and faithful. he betrayed you, so this is all on him, 100 percent, non of this is on your best friend. because your best friend did not swear any oaths or was never committed to you at all. they were just there the longest. and as for your best friend, obviously not off the hook . because for  

How do married people stay in love with their spouse when they are old, wrinkled, and grey?
I’m not quite wrinkled yet but I’m definitely past mid-life so the grey hairs have well and truly taken over. My husband and I have now reached the point where we’ve been together longer than we’ve lived apart. We met in Santorini, Greece, a few decades ago, when neither of us were necessarily looking to fall in love. He was on his way to Gallipoli to visit his great grand-father’s grave, while I had just finished university in France and wanted to spend the rest of my summer in Greece. He was the first person I remember meeting on my second day on the island. I suppose everybody was new and i 

Hmmm… let me try to answer this. When I first met my wife I thought she was crazy beautiful. I was not, however, in love with her. I didn’t know her but saw her from afar. To me she was like beautiful art. Truly gorgeous. Then I got to know her. We became best friends first. No sexual relationship. Just friends. I then learned that she was truly beautiful inside also. This is why I began to fall in love with her. It was not because of her looks, it was because of the person she is. So now we have been married for 27 years. Perhaps she is not as physically beautiful as she was back then. She is, h 

If you marry your spouse of the same age give and take about five years different then you will grow old together. Men and women will have wrinkles , white hair, arthritic joints, and all signs of ageing. If you have loving kindness for each other then you will be together until death do us apart. You will have your children to comfort you in your old age. Many men in their fifties committed adultery normally with a woman young enough to be his daughter because of unrealistic expectations . Be realistic it is your dollars which will attract some of this young women to your old body . Many an o 

I can only speak for myself and not for old, married couples. I’m still young and unmarried, but here’s my input anyway. I do not plan to marry any woman for her physical appearance. I want a woman with a certain type of personality and mindset. Physical appearances change over time, but good personalities can remain the same or even improve as spouses grow older. I will always associate my future wife’s physical appearance with her positive qualities which I’ll greatly treasure for life. When she’s old, wrinkled and grey, we will have spent so much time together and experienced so many positiv 

When I met my now wife, she was a young 26year old with long blond hair, she was the most beautiful person I had ever seen and way out of my league. Anyway I started to chat to her online, it was wonderful even though I was 16 years her senior she made me feel at ease with all we talked about, I had just come out of a loveless relationship and honestly thought I would be alone for the rest of my life. As time passed I grew close to her Sam, and looked forward to getting home from work every day so I could log on and chat to her, I would tell her about my day and she would tell me about hers, I  

You begin by choosing your partner wisely. You don't settle. You must ask yourself: Is this person the love of your life? Is this person someone you find difficult to be apart from? Is this someone who compliments you and your lifestyle? I've heard people say about the companion they're with, “She's (or he's) a good person.” Yes, that's all well and good, but it's not enough. Do they light a fire of passion within you? Do you find it hard to keep your hands off them? Next month, my wife and I will celebrate 47 years of marriage, although we've been together a lot longer having met when we were 

Being in love isn't the same thing as being in lust. All people get old and grey if they are lucky, there is no avoiding that. There is also no human right that states that we all deserve to be with someone that stays hot for their entire life. Doesn't it sound silly to expect that when you think of it that way? Everyone would be single, that's not even feasible. When you love someone, you like their personality and being with them. That doesn't necessarily go away. If you were attracted to them in the beginning, that attraction is strengthened by love. An old grey husband still looks like his y 

If you need a perfect, in-context example of what love is, read James Meszaros’ previous response to this question. If you want to understand on a more conceptual level, I’ll try to explain here… To begin with, this question conflates love with lust. And this is problematic. As a former high school English teacher, I used to spend quite a bit of time working through the difference with my students.

This is what I used to tell them: Sonnet 116 by William Shakespeare (reprinted below for ease) is the mos 

In the event that you marry your better half of the identical age give and take about 5 years different then you'll definitely grow old together. Both women and men may have lines and wrinkles , white tresses, arthritic bones, and all signs of ageing. When you have loving-kindness per other then you will be together until demise do united states aside. You will have your young ones to comfort you within old age.

Old, wrinkled, and grey? Sheesh, sonny. I bet you're a real charmer with the ladies, eh? Come closer, I can't hear ya. Ok, well…because it's too darn annoying to get up and move and start all over when you're old, wrinkled, and grey. That's why! Your joints ache, your back gives out on an almost daily basis, and gods forbid you should trip over something. You'll fall and break your dang hip. That hurts!

I am cheating on my spouse and don't want to stop. What should I do?
I was in that situation. It started simple - walks, lunches, and looking into each other’s eyes. He listened to me and payed attention to me. I imagined for months what it would be like to kiss him, to feel his body next to me, to have sex together. Three months later I was completely in love and it felt so amazing I did not want to stop, so I understand what you mean. What should you do? I’m not familiar with your situation, but I can tell you what I wish I would have done. You have to be honest with yourself and your spouse no matter how painful or unhappy it makes both you. Lying and cheatin 

As someone on the receiving end of such a transgression, I’d ask you to take a moment and truly analyse your actions. I’d ask you to perhaps, imagine what it is like to be your spouse. My husband did this, at a time when I was very newly pregnant, 6 weeks to be precise. When I found out, I was visiting my parents. I tried to get a hold of him, I needed comfort but mainly, I was panicking that I was going to miscarry. He’d told me he was having a boys weekend. With his cousins. I thought nothing of it. We were both absolutely petrified at the idea of becoming parents. The space to be with others 

So, you’re cheating and you don’t want to stop…chickenshit move, all the way around. I’m answering this assuming you are the only cheater. If it’s both of you, that is a whole nother set of problems. Pull on your grown up panties and BE HONEST. With yourself, your spouse, your kids and other family members. No matter what you do, you have destroyed the trust that is vital to a committed relationship. Since you don’t want to stop..don’t, you selfish whore! But do your partner the courtesy of a quick and clean divorce if that’s what they want, and all the alimony/child support you can muster. Don 

I was married for twenty three years. I used to joke and say that “The secret to a happy marriage is discreet affairs.” I was a major fool for saying that, and a bigger asshole for believing it at the time. I read all of the stuff that you are getting in the responses here. The truth is you are going to do what you want and no amount of cajoling, lecturing, yelling or screaming is going to change your mind. You already stated that you do not want to stop. Neither did I. Even though my wife found out about my affair and begged…literally begged…for me to come back. I was such a fool. I was in the mid 

Please seek professional help or leave your spouse. The big question is, if you don't want to stop CHEATING on your spouse then why do you want to keep this marriage. What purpose does this union serve you? Is it convenience? Clearly something important is missing or maybe you're overwhelmed. This type of behaviour is honestly despicable and frankly reckless. Betraying on the very person who is supposed to be your closest confidant and best friend in your life makes no sense whatsoever. There is absolutely no JUSTIFICATION for cheating as you always have an OPTION to divorce. You're not coerced 

Many interesting answers to this question. No doubt you have read the answers and maybe even made a decision. But here is something all humans need to understand now. As a society, we need to move on from romanticism in love. Romantic love makes a person feel wonderful in the event those feelings are reciprocated. You feel it with your lover, you felt it with your wife once upon a time. Romantic love is also a beautiful illusion. It’s put there by nature in order for us to reproduce. It also dies. Eventually. It lasts about 18 months, sometimes less and sometimes a little longer. The idea of mak 

Well, you really should stop using instant build hacks when playing competitive matches with them. Oh, wait. ‘cheating’ also refers to ‘having sex with someone without asking everyone that you are also having sex with if it’s okay to do so’. …There are weird ‘xtian’ answers likely in this thread~ This will not be one of them. Sex is sex. The allure of ‘it’s forbidden’ is one reason people ‘cheat’. Another can be that they just don’t get enough of it or feel attracted with lust to their current partner. Is your entire relationship with this person, your ‘spouse’, based around sex? Around shared resou 

Well first of all thank you for requesting an answer from me. I am not sure what I can tell you which will make a huge difference to you personally as you have already stated that you don't want to stop! Let me ask you this, why post this question on quora, what can myself or many others on here tell you that YOU deep down should already know yourself!? Your love for your wife and family should be enough to make you want to stop, the vows you took should be enough for you to stop, your marriage and memories should be enough for you to stop your own morals, values and strength of character should 

It is a reflex and easy to say: “it’s cruel, selfish to continue - get a divorce and at least stop whatever will cause that great pain your spouse will eventually experience.” This response addresses the immediate ethical concerns about life/family stability, honesty and the peace of mind which both partners deserve. But something should be added - things are complicated; if they weren’t, word would have gotten around by now. Someone who is cheating on a spouse with determination is doing so for reasons that cannot be summed up easily. Despite what we like to believe: Marriage is a dynamic process,

Hey! I’m a kid. I’m 17 to be exact, and my parents have been divorced since I was 6. I’m not sure if you have children, but just in case you want a child’s perspective- here’s mine. My father cheated on my mother. When I was about 3, he’d regularly take me to his mistresses house, where I’d meet her daughter and we would get acquainted. I could barely speak, so there wasn’t any chance of me telling her, or even recognizing that he’d broken his commitment. I can’t remember how my mother found out, but I do remember how often they’d fight, and how much pain my mother was in during the end of their  

My husband cheated on me and I decided to forgive him. We just found out that the woman is pregnant and now my husband wants her to move in with us. Should I support him?
I’ve been that other woman, the one who got pregnant. That was nearly 30 years ago, and I have a different perspective on the whole situation than I had at the time. Wife, get the hell out of that marriage. Your husband might, on some level, love you, but he does not respect you. If you stay with him, you’ll be putting up with this kind of behavior until he’s too old to get it up. You will never be able to trust him. As you cling to him, hoping to save your marriage, you are wasting time—time that you could be spending in a good relationship. I’ll bet you’re worried you’ll never find anyone els 

You have gotten some great answers already. Since I have been in a similar situation I will add my little bit. I discovered that my husband was cheating, and told him I wanted a divorce He said that his dream had been to bring his mistress and her children to our country to be able to alternate living with ’his two families’. I realized I had no idea who this man that I had been married to for 20 years was. He told our children that he found me ‘old fashioned’ for not even wanting to entertain the idea. And then my world went from being a quiet suburban life as a bureaucrat and married mother o 

“Support him” in this plan? Probably not. I think your order of prioritization of well-being should be: the babyyourselfyour husbandyour husband’s girlfriend and co-parentSo, what is best for the baby? The baby will need loving adults to take good care of it, both in the sense of nurturing it and paying for its upbringing. Would you like to help parent a child? If yes, then talk to its biological parents — your husband and his girlfriend — about what role they would like you to play in this child’s life. What are they offering you?

My husband cheated on me and I decided to forgive him. We just found out the woman is pregnant and now my husband wants her to move in with us. Should I support him? This is such a sad and incredibly devastating scenario — both to you, the wife, and the (possibly unknowing), definitely trusting other woman who is in an affair with him. She was quite possibly lied to. Perhaps, it would be easier for all of you if your husband provided and paid for, housing (an apartment) and hired help for the woman (who is pregnant with his child out of wedlock) as he is actually still legally married to you, hi 

I first discovered evidence of my ex wife's dishonesty when I was using her laptop one day; my monitor had cracked and it was being replaced. I was 27 during these events. While I was buying books on Amazon, an instant messenger tab popped up on the screen from one of her ex-boyfriends asking how her day was going. I recognized his name because a year earlier he tried to harass me on Myspace (back then, Myspace was as big as Facebook is now) when our relationship was getting serious. Then i decided to look deep into it, i picked up her cell phone which she pass worded all of a sudden without my  

Good morning…..My first response to you would be “ Are you crazy or out of your mind?” But I've been attracted to someone toxic like your husband and know how we omit reality for the dream state they put us in or the dream state we have put ourselves in. If he wants her to move in to YOUR HOME, it's because he sees her, has discussed the move with her and pretty much can bet you will be amenable with having another woman push you out of your own home. He is no longer yours…..he belongs to her body and soul, until he walks into some venue and meets a hot blond; then she and the baby will be hist 

“My husband cheated on me and I decided to forgive him. We just found out that the woman is pregnant and now my husband wants her to move in with us. Should I support him?” It depends. What does your boyfriend think of this? My husband told me that he didn't want to be with me anymore so I started seeing someone else. All of a sudden he's telling me he wants to work things out, should I tell him about the other man? In May 2019 you were pregnant with 3 weeks to go. Yet you had a baby in March 2019.

If your question is serious, the answer is entirely dependent on only one thing. Your goals for the rest of your life. You have a choice here, and I might add it's a strategic moment, one of those moments where the decision you make has profound and often are irreversible implications for the remainder of your life. Is your is your goal for the rest of your life Journey, to be one of learning, growth and expansion? If the answer that question is yes, then you should provide absolutely no support for this absurd proposition, and seriously reevaluate your husband's intent for the rest of his life 

An unequivocal and emphatic NO. Indeed, it’s hard to understand why you are contemplating the possibility. Looking ahead, at some point in the near future, a child will arrive, who invariably will become the centre of attention, as will the mother. You will then be irretrievably relegated to number 3. You already are at number 2, by dint of his amazingly self-centred request to keep his mistress in your house). You would be allowing to have you husband have his cake and eat it (twice). The quality of your relationship with him will diminish, as will your self-esteem. Your husband could easily st

Although she does not have many followers and also not a frequent writer here still, I can't restrict myself falling on her.

What would you think if a friend (with whom there was never even a kiss) invited you to dine with her, reiterating several times that if it was late you could sleep with her?
Since I foster open communication among my social circle, including making safe spaces for people to say what they feel and to accept and give rejection gracefully, I would think that my friend is saying exactly what she means. Friends can have meals together. I frequently dine with my friends, even one on one (well, I did before the world ended, anyway). Friends can also crash at each other’s houses, especially if it’s late and there are long drives ahead. All my friends have a standing offer to crash at my place if they come all the way out to where I live and it gets too late to drive home, a 

Well I think maybe she's saying IF ITS TOO LATE YOU CAN SLEEP AT HER PLACE not necessarily with her UNLESS SHE VERBALY SAID “sleep with me in my bed “ So I'd think since your “friends “ who've never shared a kiss together I'd think right away (unless she clearly said “sleep with her in her bed “ I'd think she simply means To SLEEP IN HER HOUSE but necessarly with her in her bed .UNLESS SHE STATED IT IN A CLEAR AND CONSISE MANNER .Your default idea should be UNLESS SHE WAS CLEAR ABOUT WHERE YOUR SLEEPING IN HER HOUSE .the default would be since your friends Is that yes you'll sleep in her home  

I can see how that might be a bit confusing. I would say what she meant, but didn’t say clearly, is that if it gets late you can just stay over night there at her place. That’s it, sleep, nothing more. Think of it as, woman lingo. The moment I read what you wrote she said to you I thought of the many times my female friends have said the same to me. It’s a figure of speech not a sexual come on if that’s what you’re wondering. I’m 99.9&amp;1/2% sure that I am correct in my interpretation. HOWEVER, there’s always that possibility that I could be wrong. If I am wrong and it gets late &amp; you decide to sta 

If there are no romantical feelings towards each other, I would think that she just wanted company for dinner and it f I was to sleep with her, then nothing sexual would be taking place ( because that IS possible) and also by her saying repetitively about sleeping with her, I would think she had too much to drink. However, sounds like she has been thinking about you as more than a friend for some time. She mentioned you sleeping with her lots of times because she was trying to read your thoughts on sleeping with her. If you weren't such a gentleman, you prolly could have slept with her that nig 

Sleep with her or sleep over? How long have you known this friend? Has she ever flirted with you or do you get the feeling she's into you more than just a friend? Is she attracted to men? If she said “sleep with me" than that's pretty direct. There's nothing to read into because literally that means sleep with me. If she said sleep over then I could see why you maybe reading into her words. The friends I have invite me &amp; my husband out to their place and typically if it's late they let me know that if we wanted/needed to we could spend the night. (Unless they already specified otherwise that I c 

I’d think that sounds nice. I like my friends, and a dinner and a sleepover sounds lovely, I’d almost certainly accept unless the proposed time crashed with something else on my calendar. There’s some chance that the friend in question has an interest in adding a romantic and/or sexual component to our relationship, how likely this is would depend on what our interactions are like in general though, and not just on this one invitation. (Whether or not I’d want that, would depend on how I feel about the friend in question.) Generally there’s open and honest communication between me and my friends 

Not crash — but sleep over? I think she’s far More than hinting that she like-likes you. Here’s a litmus test: Pretend you have a serious GF. Would your GF be OK with any of this? No? Why? Yah, becomes quite clear, doesn’t it? :) She’s asking for you to sleep in the same bed with her — she invited you over to eat at her place 1-on-1. She obviously at least wants you to want her. If you’re attracted to her — make a move. It’s quite obvious. She’s putting the writing on wall quite clearly. Which means even if she’s kinda screwball in the head and just wants you to want her and if/when verified she’ 

Maybe she's conveying something sneakily, but as a male, please don't take first step without getting a straight answer. Especially in such affairs which requires getting close. If she likes you, wants to go wild with you, let her say it straight forward. If you like her, express it in a friendly, decent and in a safe way possible. Let her pick up the hint, take you to bed and take it to next level. If she doesn't initiate, then just enjoy the dinner, thank her for hosting and go back to your home like a Good kid 😁 11 views · Answer requested by Michael RighiWilliam Deemer, Counsel men &amp; women on relationships for a decadeAnswered March 23, 2021 · Author has 57 answers and 25K answer views

Like many of the other posters, there’s a lot of gray area here that would need to be elaborated on to give the best answer. From what I can glean, you are just good friends and she wanted to have dinner with you and politely offered you a place to stay in case things got too late or you had too much to drink. Very few women I know, and I mean I don’t think I’ve ever met one, repeatedly tell me that if it gets a little late they’re going to “sleep with me” meaning have sex with me. Trust me most men would drag the evening out as long as possible. I’m pretty sure she was just referring to letti

So many married women cheat on their husbands for various reasons. 1. Boredom Let’s just say that boredom can kill married women. Unless she has reached a certain level of maturity even an adult woman will feel bored to death. Still remember the first time you met? She still remembers this like it was only yesterday. This will keep haunting her until she gets it, waiting patiently for her man to change his attitude and hoping that one day he will just wake up to his senses to give her the kind of excitement she yearns for. And if she can’t get it from her husband, she will look for someone who can  

Not something I’m proud of, and I’ve since quit this…but I’ve had several online affairs with married women. On top of that, I hung out in a few BBW groups on Facebook where a lot of married women cheated. I’ll give you a few of the reasons. Top reason is…THEY’RE BORED! Husband’s out working, they watch the kids all day, nothing exciting is going on for years. Someone see’s them and they feel like the hot girl in school all of a sudden. They give in to the temptation because they feel wanted for a change.Lack of sex life. Sex with one person gets mundane. Husband only likes it certain ways, and

I’ve been with a few married women and I love asking them this question just to understand how women think. One of the most interesting things I’ve found about wives who cheat is how they have to justify why their cheating. Men can cheat and have absolutely no reason for cheating apart from the fact that they were horny and the woman was hot or was available or both. Women on the other hand, seem to feel the need to justify why there doing what their doing and in most cases, the root cause is blamed on their man, never their carnal desires. So based on my observations and conversations with che 

The very top reason is attention neglect. 99.99% of wives need and want and crave attention from their husbands. They self actualise from that. As soon as she works out that the husband sees her the same way as he sees the furniture in the house or as bling, she will start to agitate. A husband must very quickly find what his wife’s personal needs are and seek to provide all of them from the start and maintain the provision as long as he is healthy to do so. The biggest personal need is communication which should remain open whatever the mood in the house. She needs to know that she is free to  

I grew up in the U.S. for about 18 years, and have been living in Asia (Thailand) for about an equal amount of time. I also have 10 years of experience listening to callers tell me stuff on a top 40 radio program I hosted, and spent an equal amount of years reading lots of letters as an advice columnist. One thing I started to notice was that people who had a more “Westernized” upbringing also felt more “entitled”. This ENTITLEMENT mentality spills over to even cheating on someone they “loved”, because the concept of being “entitled”, somehow supersedes values like Trust, Commitment, Honesty, a

selfishness and entitlement (man or woman) and all the excuses and blame-shifting are about justifying their behaviour. wrapping and warping reality around their “feelings". they will complain about their spouse failing to meet whatever needs they come up with, as if they had a hope? when all cheaters do, in order to justify their infidelity, and so sabotage any hope of resolving issues, is focus intently on only their spouses failings… (many of such “failings” most probably born out of their spouses being at at wits end, and valuing their commitments and relationships, possessing object constan 

well, my old lady has never cheated on me, and i’ve never cheated on the old crone. even though i’m an old goat myself, lol. after 20 years of marriage, we just never got the inclination. it just never felt like an option. not being in each other’s lives? good christ. we’d go fucking batshit without each other. maybe because neither of us are very romantic. we never had highfalutin romantic ideals or notions about life. we’re kinda pragmatic and practical about our relationship. both of us have major trust issues due to certain childhood life experiences. so when we met and felt this totally stra 

Reading a lot of the answers to this question is very entertaining and quite funny. I’m not here to pass moral judgement but I’m just curious why not leave your partner instead of humiliating them? Many are trying to use cliche rationales to cover up for their shortcomings. Respect is a foundational piece of any relationship or marriage. In my opinion if you truly respect your partner then you would leave before having an affair. The most common answer used by people who do not have the courage to leave instead of cheating. Oh yes! the kids are the reason why you are not going to leave your part 

Probably because their husband gets comfortable and loses his edge he becomes the nice guy dad who gets set in his daily routines most of which doesn’t involve any time set aside to show his wife how attractive and appreciated she is. Most men are oblivious to their wife’s needs a woman is a complex sexual creature who craves attention and validation, I also think women in general are not naturally monogamous and they struggle more with fidelity in long term relationships than men do. It’s sad and it’s sucks for guys who are really good men, good fathers, and husbands but most of the time thei 

Do men forgive their wives when they cheat on them?
I use explicit language to make my point. I have scanned over most of the answers and the overwhelming consensus is that, yes men can and do forgive but never forget. I have a point of view, I believe a man should not only never forgive but remove himself from the woman immediately. If you haven’t left yet, then allow me to begin. We need to establish some ground rules here. I accept in this day and age of equality and feminist force, we must say that men and women feel and are affected exactly the same way. I beg to differ, of course. Let’s take an example. An attractive woman, like above the lin 

As usual, most of the answers here are all doom and gloom. So let’s look at things in a more positive light. Yes, there is a chance your husband can forgive you for cheating. But you are going to have to work at it. And, you need to identify the reason why you cheated and ask if that reason is something that has a solution. For example: You cheated because your husband sucks in bed. You’ve been married for several years and you just wanted to have a good fuck before you got really old.If this reason is the one you cheated over, then you’ll need to get a marriage counselor and sit down with your  

No. Not in a million years even if he says he has, even if he believes he has he is fooling himself. Do not ask or expect forgiveness its impossible for you are and will remain unforgiven. You will bear your sin of infidelity and your scarlet letter to your grave. Why? Because you have murdered your marriage and raped every sense and emotion in your husband, destroyed everything he is, his past present and future, his hopes and aspirations, you stabbed him in the heart and where his love was there will be coldness of sadness. You cant take it back, you can’t fix it, it’s your cross to bear to  

No, men don't forgive cheating wives. It's very painful to a man. It's the biggest betrayal. A man needs to trust a woman 100% for a marriage to work. Before you got married, a man had to work extra hard to ensure he is financially stable to be the 'husband material' he is that you married. That meant a lot of sacrifices. It has been accepted that poor guys don't deserve commitment. Many men nowadays cringe at the thought of marrying because whatever the case it's always a lose-lose situation for men unless he is very lucky to find a good considerate woman. Among the many things he may encounter 

Can my husband forgive me for cheating on him? No A wife is put on a pedestal when they get married. With out a doubt a married man would not think of the wife having an affair. But it happened to me. She told me five years later and it devastated me. Its been 30 years ago, and as to this date I have never forgiven her. I wish she would have never told me. Now, I have became someone different by not coming home every night. I feel that I am not married any more, but she does not want me to leave. I know I am not the same man that I was before she told me. I almost let my business go because of d 

First of all, If I were your husband, I wouldn’t choose to forgive you. The reason is very simple, you betray the definition of marriage, the true meaning of marriage. Do you still remember the vow that you and your husband take in front of priest at church at the wedding ceremony? Do you, xxx, take xx to be your wife? Do you, xxx, take xxx to be your husband? Now I pronounce you husband and wife. If you still do remember these sentences, you shouldn’t have done this to your husband. You will break his heart, tear his mind apart and defile the purity of love itself. Or you can ask yourself this  

Simply no… The problem isn’t can he forgive you, I did I forgave the bitch that cheated on me and gave up everything to try make it work still… Problem is trust, no matter how hard even after a few years passed I still couldn’t trust her again not the same… and that’s the problem you know? Yes your husband who loves you likely can forgive you but you will realise the relationship will never ever ever be the same not ever again no matter how hard you try to fix it you have destroyed the trust between you. Put it this way, it’s like a glass, you cheated on him so took a hammer and smashed the glass  

Oddly enough, I don't think YOU were wondering about IF your husband could FORGIVE you while you were ON YOUR BACK AND ALL FOURS , and THE OTHER GUY WAS FUC**** YOU. His COC* in your mouth and puss* , and your legs back arms wrapped around him doing everything you could to get him to cum. If YOUR HUSBAND had another woman pinned down pumping the HELL out of her every way possible, entangled in each other and loving it, WOULD YOU FEEL LIKE FORGIVING HIM? You lied, an ungodly amount of times, lived a LIE, just to facilitate your extramarital relationship, snuck around, acted like you loved your hu 

He is already reading material about how to cope and the vast majority of it is against you. Cheating creates a brain chemistry problem in the cheater. The brain’s pleasure center has thirteen dopamine sites which are variously touched on when we do things the brain wants more of Regular sex lights-up several pleasure centers, but cheating sex lights up several more. The “cheating high” you get with your lover - your spouse will never match it now - not even close So you have completely tainted your husband’s ability to please you sexually - and you can’t fake-out your brain to give you the high E 

That's a hard thing to do forgive. I had to learn, dig, dig for answers, I went to every online resource, poured hours into research, wasnt sleeping anyways combined with my demons from Iraq and now this! Sleep is as distant as our sex lives. My situation was compounded by the fact she had trauma, from childhood which manifest its self in one of two ways, guess which bullet I caught. Some days are fine others are hell, the movie of my wife being intimate and sexual with him, it rips my heart out every time, then the anger pours in and the Marine comes out agian looking for something to destroy.  

Are long-haul truck drivers’ wives faithful to their husbands?
Did you ever meet your husband's mistress?
It was a weekend winter day and he was not my husband so she was not a mistress, just the other girl he cheated with. He’s my first love and back then it felt like there would be no second or third. Funny right? But i guess first love could be like that too many people. He was an expat working in my country and recently we were talking about him going back to his country because of work so I was sort of moving out. I came (back) that afternoon so I could get some of my thing I needed for next week. I already gave my key back and therefore called him to let me in. I thought we would spend time t 

Yes. She's a cashier at our local grocery store &amp; unfortunately I see her from time to time. It's not easy but I make a point, when I see her, to be pleasant &amp; treat her like any other person in the store. I do this for two reasons. #1. I have class. I'm a single mom now &amp; when I'm grocery-shopping my daughter is usually with me. I want to provide a good example to her. His mistress may have been one of the major contributors to the destruction of my marriage, but I refuse to let her be destructive to my character. In the grand scheme of things she is insignificant &amp; I refuse to let her steal a 

Yes, but I did not know she was one of his mistresses at the time because he would always come home on time and race to me like I was the winning lottery ticket. Who would have thought a car during your lunch hour is the equivalent of a hotel room (for future mistresses)? I went to his job once and he introduced me to everyone including that girl. I told him that that girl really grieves my spirit. He mocked me saying, she grieves my spirit, she grieves my spirit. I ignored that and said, make sure you are never alone with her because I don’t want her to falsely accuse you of something . I feel 

My husband &amp; I were separated at the time. I don’t think he’d been seeing her while we were still together, but I have no way of knowing that for sure. I was trying to work things out, and I thought he was too, when I found out he was seeing someone else. With a little bit of keen detective work, my sister &amp; I found out she was a waitress at a little restaurant on the other side of town. Now, I’d long outgrown any thoughts of revenge, but I felt the need to check her out; find out what was so special about her that my husband would give up our marriage. My sister and I decided to go to lunch at  

I knew her very well. When her husband shattered his knee to such an extent in a soccer game he almost lost his leg due to lack of proper medical care, I made my husband hire her even though she could barely type and he had to spell every word to her and tell her where all punctuation went. Despite her lack of skill, I made my husband pay her twice what she had been paid before at her old job so she was being paid what both she and her husband had earned prior to her husband’s accident. I could be wrong, but if you phuck someone’s wife, then you take care of the whole family when her husband is 

My husband’s “mistress” was his ex-wife. This woman cheated on him with a coworker and they subsequently divorced. While we were dating she threatened to kill herself to manipulate him. Her excuse for being such a homewrecker and for sleeping around in general was that her uncle fingered her when she was 12. She kept his last name maybe because her maiden name was so common in her home country of Vietnam that she felt more special to have an European name? Or maybe because she was just one of those apathetic and basic bitches that never bothered to change it back because she just didn’t get ar 

I wonder about my father's mistress. In feudal times in China, it was considered a status symbol for a man to have a mistress. It showed that he was successful, wealthy and virile. The term for a mistress in those days was “concubine”. My parents grew up in very traditional families who observed many of the old ways, even after they settled in Singapore. After my father passed away in his early 70s, my mother came across a bank book for a joint account belonging to him and someone else. She found a photo of him with another woman and a man’s wedding band she hadn’t seen him wear before. The phon 

Yes and I even remember the day that he met her. He was a manager of a video store and was hiring new employees, she and her twin sister came in and I remember him coming home that evening and saying “smell the twins” as he put his hands in front of my face. Apparently he liked the body spray she wore. I continued to hear about the twins and asked many times if anything was going on but he always said they were just friends. He even went out with our mutual friend/roommate with the twins and I asked the roommate and he said they were just friends. This went on for many months she even came to  

My ex and I never married. We met in 2002 and began dating. I don’t know if I can say I ever “loved” him. He was 40 I was 25. We were on two different levels from the start. Not so much because of our age difference, although that is a part of it, but more because I was completely oblivious and naive to his predatory nature. He is a predator and I had come from a background where abuse was normal AND I had never experienced what it felt like to be loved, so the only thing I had to compare was my background of not mattering to anyone being normal, so his treatment of me was normal, for the most  

Yes, I did. My husband worked for a armored car company, a prominent one. And what was horrible about it, she worked with him on the same truck. Every day, every day, they were together… and it killed me. This was before I knew for sure she WAS in fact, his mistress. I met her one day, at the office, because I was picking him up that day. I had my suspicions, as I had heard a phone conversation, that he didn't know I heard. It was a strange conversation, not really work related. Plus it affected other aspects of our life, if you know what I mean!! Then he started coming home later and later. A w 

Husbands, what thing(s) does your wife do for you that you appreciate the most?
Does your spouse look completely different from when you married them? How do you feel about this?
This is the evolution of a marriage during 15 years - a true Kafkian metamorphosis. My then fiancé and me, circa 2004  What do I think about it? Damn, we were hot On our wedding day  You can see how at that point I started to make his hair gray  2007 in the South of France  2009 in Argentina  2012 in Hawaii, three months before he became sick  2013 - less than six months later, in the rehabilitation hospital, after losing close to 50 lb of weigh, along with portions of all of his four limbs (I have written about his illness in Andrea Pargel's answer to What is your experience with misdiagnosis? and Andrea P 

I married my then 21 year old husband, who happened to be my sister's baby daddy’s best friend LOL I'm a few years older at 24 on our wedding date of July 4th, 2001… he had just turned 21 on June 29th and I was to be 25 on July 14th LOL  We had only been together exactly 3 months when we decided to get married and made it official in Las Vegas 2 months later, was all 😁 It hasn't been an easy marriage since we separated in 2007 and I divorced him in 2010… all of that only to take him back in October of 2012. I believe he was, in my opinion, too young and I was just barely at the age that seemed  

Maybe not completely but he does look different! Let me introduce to you my amazing husband, his name is Yomi, he is nigerian but we've been living together in Scotland for over 6 years now. Photo of when we started dating: (I was 21 and he was 23.)  Id like to just specify that I had never even thought of dating a man that was not Caucasian before but I guess when a man like him gets placed on your way, how can you resist? So let me tell you how he changed. First he started losing a bit of his hair, not so much but enough to just decide to start shaving his hair ( I am the one cutting his hair). Th 

Picture taken in 1981, two years after we were married   Picture taken in 2016, 37 years into our marriage  Taken New years eve..2016  Yes, they change but if you love each other you accept the change. Personally I love his changes because he is older, more mature and so much fun. Men, as they age, seem to become more compassionate and understanding of the female ways.. He puts up with me and my crazy ways. He understands what it means to have my makeup on, hair fixed and crazy bad habits, like horrible nail biting. He doesn't care if I look like a monster in the morning, doesn't care that I may gain 

We have been married for 41+ years and of course we both look very different than when we first met and started to build a lifetime of love. Looks are physical characteristics that have a lot to do with lust, but little to do with love. You can’t see or feel our souls, that privilege is reserved for two and only two lovers, so you have no ability to understand how beautiful we are to each other. Physically we bear the normal scars of a lifetime, some normal aging, some exceptional, Somme medical and none chosen by us purposely. Wrinkles and lines from both laughing and from grieving. I remain ever 

Not really. When we met, I looked like this…  Couldn't tell me a damn thing with my low quality, high contrast selfies. And he looked like this…  (I should specify. We had known each other for years before we began a relationship. I don't have any pictures from way back then) Through the years we have married, had children, gotten a few degrees, built a home, maintained a farm, started a business (along with our day-to-day jobs), done some traveling, suffered many painful &amp; very personal losses, had a few breakdowns, had a few breakthroughs, gained some weight (I'm a jam up cook, ok?), and lost some  

Oh my YES! We have both been through a gamut of changes, physically, emotionally and spiritually in our +30 years together. I was always concerned that I looked so much older (7 yrs older!) when we got together, but it wasn’t long before we looked the same age. I grew up with a dad 20 years older than my mom, so I was uncomfortable being the older one. But the wheel turns on this big world of ours and nothing that is living and vital stays static. We both have added wrinkles, gained and lost weight (oddly enough at different times) and both have dealt with difficult health issues. I actually h 

I know this is an older question, but it is so fascinating to me! Of course we look different from when we married! But that is what is so magnificent about meeting so young. I get to know him in every stage, and it is so lovely. We met at 18 , married at 23, and are now in our mid-30’s. I look different, and so does he. He is so much more refined and handsome in so many ways, to me. When I see our early photos now, it feels odd that we were ever that young. I work with students our age, so it is strange to find him attractive at such a young age still, but I am in love with those memories. We 

Yes. We both look very different after twelve years. When we first got together we were in our mid twenties. We had full heads of hair, fast metabolisms, and the whole world ahead of us.  (He was trying to look cool smoking a Cuban cigar, but failed miserably, lol)  Both of us were so thin back then! What happened?Fast forward twelve years:  Neither of us is fat per se, but Matt has developed the dad bod (which is weird because he’s not a dad), and my weight is no longer in the double digits.   Matt’s hair has thinned a bit on top, we’ve both got a lot of grey hairs and wrinkles, but we’re still happy 

Of course!! We are both 69 now, and we were 20 when we met! He looked, when we met, like an adorable Shih Tzu puppy, with long brown hair and a big moustache, better than Sam Elliott’s (STILL better) and slender. Not anymore. Now he is balding on top, and has salt and pepper hair (mostly salt) and although he still has a great moustache, it’s all grey now, and he has a nicely trimmed beard (nicely trimmed because I hand scissor trim it myself). Oh, and all his extra weight is in his belly. How do I feel about it? I still adore him. It’s been 48 long years now. The change was, of course, gradual,  

What is the juiciest secret you know about your neighbor's spouse?
I stay in apartment and moved into my new house recently. Whenever i walked back home she will open the door and watches me with a smile. I smile at her back and yesterday we walked over near her door and asked me want to have drinks with her as she is feeling lonely as her husband is on night shift. i had shower and walked over to my next door and knocked her door and then brought her home. We had wine and then she move over my crotch unexpectedly and said can i see what you have there. Before even i said yes she started to pull down my boxer and grabbed my package out of it.

The juiciest true secret happened one morning when I was home alone and my neighbor's spouse was home alone. At the time I didn't even know she was home when suddenly I heard profanity coming through the screen in the front door. I went to check it out. It was my neighbor's spouse. She had tripped over my garden hose. I apologized but she said it was a nice looking hose and wanted to know more about it. After a few minutes of talking about the exceptional quality of my hose I ask her what she had come over to ask. She said she had notice how well I kept our bushes trimmed. Then she stared dire 

He was a very friendly man, but not very talkative until he started drinking. At which point I soon learned he became very talkative, and prone to over-sharing.

It had bothered him a lot, they had gotten together when he was 24 and she was 19. Years passed, no child. Not even so much as a single pregnancy scare and it began to worry them. Doctor said there was nothing wrong as far as he could tell, suggested lifestyle changes but couldn’t do much more...  Suddenly our n 

When I move away for a year I rented my house to a dancer I met in a strip club. She was a fantastic tenant. Never once late on rent and was awesome on the maintenance (I asked her once and she said “I just ask a customer over and wear a thong while he mows the lawn, does the gutters etc”). I should add that I am pretty rural and dont get many people who can overlook my land unless they try really really hard. So one thing leads to another and it sounds like she got short for money. I didn’t know about this - kept getting my $$$ every month as agreed. All went well and after the year I moved bac 

The new neighbor moved in the attached house in front of mine three months ago. I never talked to him but my other neighbor Angela, a very outgoing and chatty middle aged Russian lady started of course a conversation with him as soon as the opportunity arose. She found out -and later on told me- that he’s from South Africa and that his wife is still back there finishing some job but will follow soon. I didn’t pay much attention because to be honest the guy seems to be a grey, dull human being. But the other day my dearest neighbor invited me for dinner and at some point she commented that the du

Well, not much about my own neighbors. but I’m still sitting on a letter from a friend of mine who found out a little too much about the fact that his neighbor’s late spouse was apparently a NAZI sabateur. When the man passed, his family threw out all of his Nazi memorabilia, but a few items were missed by the garbage man in a box. It included a flag, some memorabilia and a signed letter from Rudolf Hess, direct from Spandau Prison.

Mmmmm well, this may be fairly old and I don’t live there anymore and I won’t reveal her identity but that’s a woman who used to work with me and was a “slut”, she was my neighbor too, we lived in the same apartment complex.

The biggest personal need is communication which should remain open whatever the mood in the house. She needs to know that she is free to  

I grew up in the U.S. for about 18 years, and have been living in Asia (Thailand) for about an equal amount of time. I also have 10 years of experience listening to callers tell me stuff on a top 40 radio program I hosted, and spent an equal amount of years reading lots of letters as an advice columnist. One thing I started to notice was that people who had a more “Westernized” upbringing also felt more “entitled”. This ENTITLEMENT mentality spills over to even cheating on someone they “loved”, because the concept of being “entitled”, somehow supersedes values like Trust, Commitment, Honesty, a 

Not something I’m proud of, and I’ve since quit this…but I’ve had several online affairs with married women. On top of that, I hung out in a few BBW groups on Facebook where a lot of married women cheated. I’ll give you a few of the reasons. Top reason is…THEY’RE BORED! Husband’s out working, they watch the kids all day, nothing exciting is going on for years. Someone see’s them and they feel like the hot girl in school all of a sudden. They give in to the temptation because they feel wanted for a change.Lack of sex life. Sex with one person gets mundane. Husband only likes it certain ways, and

selfishness and entitlement (man or woman) and all the excuses and blame-shifting are about justifying their behaviour. wrapping and warping reality around their “feelings". they will complain about their spouse failing to meet whatever needs they come up with, as if they had a hope? when all cheaters do, in order to justify their infidelity, and so sabotage any hope of resolving issues, is focus intently on only their spouses failings… (many of such “failings” most probably born out of their spouses being at at wits end, and valuing their commitments and relationships, possessing object constan 

well, my old lady has never cheated on me, and i’ve never cheated on the old crone. even though i’m an old goat myself, lol. after 20 years of marriage, we just never got the inclination. it just never felt like an option. not being in each other’s lives? good christ. we’d go fucking batshit without each other. maybe because neither of us are very romantic. we never had highfalutin romantic ideals or notions about life. we’re kinda pragmatic and practical about our relationship. both of us have major trust issues due to certain childhood life experiences. so when we met and felt this totally stra 

Reading a lot of the answers to this question is very entertaining and quite funny. I’m not here to pass moral judgement but I’m just curious why not leave your partner instead of humiliating them? Many are trying to use cliche rationales to cover up for their shortcomings. Respect is a foundational piece of any relationship or marriage. In my opinion if you truly respect your partner then you would leave before having an affair. The most common answer used by people who do not have the courage to leave instead of cheating. Oh yes! the kids are the reason why you are not going to leave your part 

Probably because their husband gets comfortable and loses his edge he becomes the nice guy dad who gets set in his daily routines most of which doesn’t involve any time set aside to show his wife how attractive and appreciated she is. Most men are oblivious to their wife’s needs a woman is a complex sexual creature who craves attention and validation, I also think women in general are not naturally monogamous and they struggle more with fidelity in long term relationships than men do. It’s sad and it’s sucks for guys who are really good men, good fathers, and husbands but most of the time thei 

How do I talk to my wife about her period behaviors?
I’m treating this as a good-faith question by an anonymous asker whose details were deleted by Quora because they didn’t have an edit link:  Where do you live? In America a product was released a few years ago that really helps preventing stained sheets while sleeping, if that's what you are experiencing.  Check this out. It looks like a regular overnight pad, albeit a chonky one . . .  then you open it up and WHOA. It just. keeps. opening. This is the stretch limo of pads.  This thing was apparently engineered by product designers who actually interviewed, or who actually are, people who sleep while  

i had my period for nearly 40 years and I can not remember blood ever getting anywhere in the house, except on the sheets occasionally after a full night of sleeping on my back. If there is errant blood left here and there, that is uncommon, and a couple things could be going on. The most obvious answer is that your wife has a heavy flow and is not using pads adequate for it. She may need a pad that is much longer than what she is using, and possibly thicker, although thin pads are pretty effective these days. Tampons are no more effective than pads, just placed differently. Some women find the 

I found this question a bit odd. Providing a couple have a good enough marriage/relationship, most women will feel comfortable enough to talk about this subject. In certain culture, the topic may be considered embarrassing to be brought up in a conversation between a man and a woman, but certainly not between husband and wife. Menstruation is something natural, and i is normal for women to sometimes “leak".Tampons is not leak proof. I use tampons and I still stain the bedsheet sometimes. I prefer tampons than pads as I feel they are more comfortable but some women find pads more comfortable. The p 

I'm going to comfortably assume “getting period blood EVERYWHERE” is an exaggeration and your wife doesn't actually turn your house onto the Overlook Hotel every month.  I'm assuming what you mean is, “My wife gets blood in places I'd rather she not get blood.” So what are we talking about here? The toilet seat? The bathroom floor? The trash bin? You'll need to be specific and avoid hyperbole when discussing this with her. Note that pads vs. tampons isn't the issue here. Pads aren't inherently more messy than tampons. She can use whichever product she feels more comfortable with and still avoid e 

Tampons always made my cramping much worse for some reason, and they aren’t leak proof either. You didn’t go in to detail about where you are seeing the blood so we are left having guess as to what the issue may be, is she just messy, or is she having leaking issues which may be staining the bed or furniture? Your wife may be suffering from very heavy periods, and if that is the case there isn’t much she can do about it. Before my hysterectomy I was having extremely heavy periods that were lasting three or more weeks with only a few days of relief between them, and leaking was often an issue a 

Well tread carefully here. This is gonna go one of two ways so choose your words carefully. Start by saying “ honey you know how much I love you, which is why I'm concerned about you enough to ask you…….”, then go on to ask her your question or to state your cause. But I will almost guarantee you the outcome will either be this, she will not so nicely let you know that her periods have nothing to do with you and you should mind your own business and steer clear of her if you have problems with her during said time, or, your gonna get more information that you really wanted and she will from th 

I would just deal with it and clean it up for her. If she gets blood on the sheets tell her don't worry here is a nice cup of tea I'll change the sheets. If it's on the toilet seat and she doesn't realise just clean it up and don't bother mentioning it. I would imagine she is unaware of most of this and it's accidental. Try to understand some women can get extra emotional or have painful pediods. Imagine yourself in that position and just do what you would want to happen in her place. It's as natural as breathing and can affect her a lot. My wife can get very emotional and easily angered when  

It’s none of your business how she handles her vagina. It is your business if there is blood in parts of your home that there shouldn’t be. What the hell do you know about tampons vs. pads anyways? Just state the problem: there is blood ____ and _____ can you please do something to avoid this in the future, and let her figure out how to deal with her vagina. Also realize that this is a bodily function and there is no way to completely avoid it just like it’s not reasonable for her to say “can you please not shed hairs from your head around the house?” but she can ask you to clean up a big hair 

For more context, she gets period blood on the sheets where we sleep, on the floor, and leaves her bloody underwear laying around the bathroom. She also frequently shits herself during her period, and leaves those in the bathroom laying around too. The last time I tried talking to her about it, she blamed me, saying her periods were light before we were sexually active and that this my fault. 225 views · View upvotes17Anne Pellerin, former Pharm Tech, Dental Secretary, Nursing Assistant  (2003-2014)Answered March 16, 2021 · Author has 566 answers and 1.8M answer views

‘Tis confusion! The original question was obviously about blood spatter and insinuated that the wife was channeling Jackson Pollock on the blank canvas of their apartment, but this new &amp; improved streamlined question is Something Completely Different! WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF: “period behaviours” Menstrual insanity? Mrs fury hath descended? Our Lady of Rage? Pissed-off Missus? Don’t poke the bear? We are not amused?

Does your spouse look completely different from when you married them? How do you feel about this?
This is the evolution of a marriage during 15 years - a true Kafkian metamorphosis. My then fiancé and me, circa 2004  What do I think about it? Damn, we were hot On our wedding day  You can see how at that point I started to make his hair gray  2007 in the South of France  2009 in Argentina  2012 in Hawaii, three months before he became sick  2013 - less than six months later, in the rehabilitation hospital, after losing close to 50 lb of weigh, along with portions of all of his four limbs (I have written about his illness in Andrea Pargel's answer to What is your experience with misdiagnosis? and Andrea P 

I married my then 21 year old husband, who happened to be my sister's baby daddy’s best friend LOL I'm a few years older at 24 on our wedding date of July 4th, 2001… he had just turned 21 on June 29th and I was to be 25 on July 14th LOL  We had only been together exactly 3 months when we decided to get married and made it official in Las Vegas 2 months later, was all 😁 It hasn't been an easy marriage since we separated in 2007 and I divorced him in 2010… all of that only to take him back in October of 2012.

Maybe not completely but he does look different! Let me introduce to you my amazing husband, his name is Yomi, he is nigerian but we've been living together in Scotland for over 6 years now. Photo of when we started dating: (I was 21 and he was 23.)  Id like to just specify that I had never even thought of dating a man that was not Caucasian before but I guess when a man like him gets placed on your way, how can you resist? So let me tell you how he changed. First he started losing a bit of his hair, not so much but enough to just decide to start shaving his hair ( I am the one cutting his hair). Th

Personally I love his changes because he is older, more mature and so much fun. Men, as they age, seem to become more compassionate and understanding of the female ways.. He puts up with me and my crazy ways. He understands what it means to have my makeup on, hair fixed and crazy bad habits, like horrible nail biting.

We have been married for 41+ years and of course we both look very different than when we first met and started to build a lifetime of love. Looks are physical characteristics that have a lot to do with lust, but little to do with love. You can’t see or feel our souls, that privilege is reserved for two and only two lovers, so you have no ability to understand how beautiful we are to each other. Physically we bear the normal scars of a lifetime, some normal aging, some exceptional, Somme medical and none chosen by us purposely. Wrinkles and lines from both laughing and from grieving. I remain ever 

Not really. When we met, I looked like this…  Couldn't tell me a damn thing with my low quality, high contrast selfies. And he looked like this…  (I should specify. We had known each other for years before we began a relationship. I don't have any pictures from way back then) Through the years we have married, had children, gotten a few degrees, built a home, maintained a farm, started a business (along with our day-to-day jobs), done some traveling, suffered many painful &amp; very personal losses, had a few breakdowns, had a few breakthroughs, gained some weight (I'm a jam up cook, ok?), and lost some  

Oh my YES! We have both been through a gamut of changes, physically, emotionally and spiritually in our +30 years together. I was always concerned that I looked so much older (7 yrs older!) when we got together, but it wasn’t long before we looked the same age. I grew up with a dad 20 years older than my mom, so I was uncomfortable being the older one. But the wheel turns on this big world of ours and nothing that is living and vital stays static. We both have added wrinkles, gained and lost weight (oddly enough at different times) and both have dealt with difficult health issues. I actually h 

I know this is an older question, but it is so fascinating to me! Of course we look different from when we married! But that is what is so magnificent about meeting so young. I get to know him in every stage, and it is so lovely. We met at 18 , married at 23, and are now in our mid-30’s. I look different, and so does he. He is so much more refined and handsome in so many ways, to me. When I see our early photos now, it feels odd that we were ever that young. I work with students our age, so it is strange to find him attractive at such a young age still, but I am in love with those memories. We 

Yes. We both look very different after twelve years. When we first got together we were in our mid twenties. We had full heads of hair, fast metabolisms, and the whole world ahead of us.  (He was trying to look cool smoking a Cuban cigar, but failed miserably, lol)  Both of us were so thin back then! What happened?Fast forward twelve years:  Neither of us is fat per se, but Matt has developed the dad bod (which is weird because he’s not a dad), and my weight is no longer in the double digits.   Matt’s hair has thinned a bit on top, we’ve both got a lot of grey hairs and wrinkles, but we’re still happy 

Of course!! We are both 69 now, and we were 20 when we met! He looked, when we met, like an adorable Shih Tzu puppy, with long brown hair and a big moustache, better than Sam Elliott’s (STILL better) and slender. Not anymore. Now he is balding on top, and has salt and pepper hair (mostly salt) and although he still has a great moustache, it’s all grey now, and he has a nicely trimmed beard (nicely trimmed because I hand scissor trim it myself). Oh, and all his extra weight is in his belly. How do I feel about it? I still adore him. It’s been 48 long years now. The change was, of course, gradual,  

What is usually considered husband material?
I know what doesn’t. Reverse the bold for good. Men who are disrespectful. They talk and disseminate negative things about other people, themselves and about their partner. Their lives are examples and experiments of embarrassment and social faux pas. They want to be respected and goes around thinking ‘respect is earned’. Actually, ‘respect is given where is due’. They get away with their peers but not by their higher ups and bosses. And that’s why they are not respected but couldn’t understand why. The actual ‘big wigs’ just see them as a joke and talks fluff. They soon will find out the hard

He loves your good qualities, and accepts the bad.  Without making you feel guilty for having flaws.  You don’t need to hide your true self from him and put on a front in order to be what you think he wants. You can share your true self and be vulnerable and feel safe doing so, knowing that if anything it will make him feel even closer to you.  2. He is there for you when you need him, even if it’s inconvenient for him.  A partnership

Men who remain calm in a crisis No matter who you are married life will be full of storms that you’ll have to weather together. Life happens.

What's the most shocking thing you found in your spouse's possessions?
What is a stand you took with your in-laws that you will never apologize for?
My stand was not with my husband’s parents, but with my brother in law’s wife. My husband’s family is very tight knit. They will close ranks pretty quick when they don’t have a warm fuzzy feeling about someone. They have always kept her at arm’s length. She always behaves like she is the queen of the world and everything has to be her way.

I had sent them pamphlets for places we liked to visit so they could pl

I met my then boyfriend at 18 and we became quite serious quite quickly. However, he had quite pushy parents who wanted him to join the military. His whole family had been in the military but he was of a lot more sensitive nature and it wasn't something he was actively engaged in pursuing. After some discussions we agreed we would move in together instead. This was quickly vetoed by his parents and before I knew it I had a ring on my finger and was 300 miles away from home.

My husband fell into what appeared to be a mid-life crisis a good 10 years ago. He became withdrawn, unhappy, bored, and unfulfilled with life in general.

What's the most useless thing your significant other or spouse ever bought?
How do married people stay in love with their spouse when they are old, wrinkled, and grey?
I’m not quite wrinkled yet but I’m definitely past mid-life so the grey hairs have well and truly taken over. My husband and I have now reached the point where we’ve been together longer than we’ve lived apart. We met in Santorini, Greece, a few decades ago, when neither of us were necessarily looking to fall in love. He was on his way to Gallipoli to visit his great grand-father’s grave, while I had just finished university in France and wanted to spend the rest of my summer in Greece. He was the first person I remember meeting on my second day on the island. I suppose everybody was new and i 

Hmmm… let me try to answer this. When I first met my wife I thought she was crazy beautiful. I was not, however, in love with her. I didn’t know her but saw her from afar. To me she was like beautiful art. Truly gorgeous. Then I got to know her. We became best friends first. No sexual relationship. Just friends. I then learned that she was truly beautiful inside also. This is why I began to fall in love with her. It was not because of her looks, it was because of the person she is. So now we have been married for 27 years. Perhaps she is not as physically beautiful as she was back then. She is, h 

If you marry your spouse of the same age give and take about five years different then you will grow old together. Men and women will have wrinkles , white hair, arthritic joints, and all signs of ageing. If you have loving kindness for each other then you will be together until death do us apart. You will have your children to comfort you in your old age. Many men in their fifties committed adultery normally with a woman young enough to be his daughter because of unrealistic expectations .

I can only speak for myself and not for old, married couples. I’m still young and unmarried, but here’s my input anyway. I do not plan to marry any woman for her physical appearance. I want a woman with a certain type of personality and mindset. Physical appearances change over time, but good personalities can remain the same or even improve as spouses grow older. I will always associate my future wife’s physical appearance with her positive qualities which I’ll greatly treasure for life. When she’s old, wrinkled and grey, we will have spent so much time together and experienced so many positiv

You begin by choosing your partner wisely. You don't settle. You must ask yourself: Is this person the love of your life? Is this person someone you find difficult to be apart from? Is this someone who compliments you and your lifestyle? I've heard people say about the companion they're with, “She's (or he's) a good person.” Yes, that's all well and good, but it's not enough. Do they light a fire of passion within you? Do you find it hard to keep your hands off them? Next month, my wife and I will celebrate 47 years of marriage, although we've been together a lot longer having met when we were 

Being in love isn't the same thing as being in lust. All people get old and grey if they are lucky, there is no avoiding that. There is also no human right that states that we all deserve to be with someone that stays hot for their entire life. Doesn't it sound silly to expect that when you think of it that way? Everyone would be single, that's not even feasible. When you love someone, you like their personality and being with them. That doesn't necessarily go away. If you were attracted to them in the beginning, that attraction is strengthened by love. An old grey husband still looks like his y 

If you need a perfect, in-context example of what love is, read James Meszaros’ previous response to this question. If you want to understand on a more conceptual level, I’ll try to explain here… To begin with, this question conflates love with lust. And this is problematic.

In the event that you marry your better half of the identical age give and take about 5 years different then you'll definitely grow old together. Both women and men may have lines and wrinkles , white tresses, arthritic bones, and all signs of ageing. When you have loving-kindness per other then you will be together until demise do united states aside. You will have your young ones to comfort you within old age. A lot of men within their fifties committed adultery normally with a female younger adequate to be their girl as a result of unrealistic expectations . Be practical it is your dollars  

Old, wrinkled, and grey? Sheesh, sonny. I bet you're a real charmer with the ladies, eh? Come closer, I can't hear ya. Ok, well…because it's too darn annoying to get up and move and start all over when you're old, wrinkled, and grey. That's why! Your joints ache, your back gives out on an almost daily basis, and gods forbid you should trip over something. You'll fall and break your dang hip. That hurts! Have you ever fallen, and not been able to get up? It's not nearly as fun as it sounds, let me tell ya. For the ones that last, part of how it happens is that you've been together for years, you 

What is a stand you took with your in-laws that you will never apologize for?
My stand was not with my husband’s parents, but with my brother in law’s wife. My husband’s family is very tight knit. They will close ranks pretty quick when they don’t have a warm fuzzy feeling about someone. They have always kept her at arm’s length. She always behaves like she is the queen of the world and everything has to be her way. After my husband and I had been married a little over ten years, BIL, wife and their sons came down to visit us in South Carolina. I prepared for their visit for several weeks in advance. I had sent them pamphlets for places we liked to visit so they could pl

I met my then boyfriend at 18 and we became quite serious quite quickly. However, he had quite pushy parents who wanted him to join the military.

After some discussions we agreed we would move in together instead. This was quickly vetoed by his parents and before I knew it I had a ring on my finger and was 300 miles away from home.

What do physicians' spouses know that the average person typically does not?
A few things. (Physician's Spouse here) 1.) No matter how calm and focused a doctor sounds when delivering bad news, they take that shit home with them. Now a neurologist has to deliver a lot of shit news. Pretty much, if you end up in my wife's office, something out of the ordinary has gone wrong. Migraines are the least of her worries. She's dealing with MS, Dementia, Strokes, Epilepsy, Gullien Barre, Neuropathy, Parkinson’s, Brain Tumors, and the mother fucker of all mother fuckers, ALS. The last one is the worst for her. Because she knows. Almost right away, and can't say anything. Because a l 

Not a physician's spouse, but an ER doctor and a sports doctor's daughter. There's a few things that come from such a situation. First, there's the assumption your family is crazy rich. To the outsider, the idea of two doctors together always seems to equate a huge amount of money. However, I have four siblings, and my parents divorced almost ten years ago. If anything, we were able to live comfortably up until this year, when my father wrongfully lost a court case (the woman that sued him submitted only lies as evidence). We are not crazy rich. Second, there's the misjudgements some patients ma 

I am a Radiologist married to a Urologist It is hard supporting the work of workoholic doctors The night my husband gets phone calls for emergency it actually disturbs everybody's sleep especially a celebrity thinks any small aberration is so serious and goes on disturbing with their phone calls People don't realize that. We do not have a great liking towards free consultation outside of our work space ..for eg on your morning walks .. marriage receptions parties etc.We need a downtime We are more comfortable with poor and middle class patients….least interested in wealth and fame of patients.They 

I know a lot of medicaleese. Did you know, for instance, that peak onset of analegisia from parcetomal is 20 minutes? I know a lot of theory. When someone says “paracetomal doesn't work for me” I can stab a guess at why. I know the theory of putting an arterial line. I know why your anaesthetist didn't give you a spinal. It wasn't personal. Give me two common scenarios and I'll come up with a diagnosis and a differential diagnosis. I read a fantastic answer on Quora about a young person struggling to breathe. “PE” was my immediate guess, and I was bang on: pulmonary embolism. At this point, I'm w 

I am a doctor, but I am also the spouse of a doctor. It is kind of surprising (well, maybe not, because the world is kinda sexist) but many people simply assume that I am some sort of dumb girl who “married the doctor.” I have had people say things to me like, “wow, it must be great whenever you go somewhere, knowing that you are married to the smartest person in the room.” Of course, well, they assume that HE is the smart one, and I could not possibly EVER be the smartest person in the room because of those pesky XX chromosomes. I have found that people who know us casually often have no idea  

Not quite the spouse of a physician, but the son of a surgeon, so I think I can comment. When I was young, a major bone of contention between my parents was when my mum, who was a teacher, came home, she wanted to talk about her day, and my dad, who was a paediatric surgeon, didn’t want to talk about his. He’s always been emotionally undemonstrative, and he didn’t really get involved with his grandchildren until they were teenagers. After he retired, he was involved in an enquiry into the death of a child during surgery. He was on the stand for several days, with barristers trying to catch him o 

Spouses know their partners worked far harder than most kids in high school and undergrad. They sacrificed parties, dating, hobbies and other social events to do volunteer work, take prep courses, study for their extra hard load of classes. Spouses also know that their physician spouses missed family functions, went into huge debt and barely kept up with politics or pop culture throughout medical school and residency. If they were lucky enough to have a partner during that time, that partner had to help with laundry, banking, shopping and other errands so their physician partner could study or  

I love Harry Potter. My children love Harry Potter. We watch Harry Potter movies over and over, like when they show up on TNT on random Saturday nights in the winter. We fold laundry to Harry Potter movies. We enjoy Harry Potter theme parks, and one of my daughters wears socks from each of the four houses. My physician wife does not believe in the whole magic thing. it just does not resonate with her. At first I was put off by this. What is this? I married a woman who does not believe in magic? Huh? Everybody else goes crazy over Harry Potter, but not my wife? Yep, I married a physician who is a  

That they love medicine. That your childrens ailments aren't serious because "sick" to your doctor spouse means a patient is close to dying. That there are many excellent nurses, physicians and surgeons in public hospitals. (Australia) That when doctors talk real shop it sucks mostly because you don't know the vernacular so it's hard to understand anything. I find social situations irritating when the spouse of a doctor lives vicariously through their doctor spouse as if they themselves are the doctor. I have experienced this with both male and female spouses. That many of my assumptions about over 

That when my wife went to medical school, so did the entire family. Every step of the way, from the countless prep courses through the application insanity, the bad professors, the stench of formaldehyde during Anatomy to the match, everyone pitched in. The in-laws helped with child care and meals. I picked up homemaking and bill paying tasks. I met our kid’s teachers. I took him to soccer practice and cub scouts. The cost of medical education, the power of compound interest and the IRS. My wife finished with $200k in debt. When we’re finished paying off her loans she will have repaid over $300 

What is the most underhanded thing your mother-in-law did to you or your husband that she mistakenly thought went unnoticed?
What types of men make horrible husbands?
Everyone has pretty much covered the abusers, cheaters, players, bad boys, murderers, ect…. I wanna cover the other sort, which might be less offensive, well some of them, but it’s not something you should overlook either. The One Who Bores You to Death:   Seriously, marriage isn’t always fun or full of romance, but you two are going to have to make it more fun with making one another laugh, teasing one another or doing common things you find fun. While this doesn’t have to be every single day, at least more than once a week, having common interests helps keep the spark alive. Complete boredom

What types of men make horrible husbands? The kind that don't match well with the woman you are. That might have sounded vague but when you exclude the obvious, like guys that beat up on women, there really is no cookie cutter answer. I am not sure why but most of my male friends are “handy” kind of guys. I am not. I am all thumbs. I can do things like change my own oil in the car and fix things around the house but it doesn't come naturally for me and it will take me at least twice as long as most of my “handy” buddies.  I have an old army buddy who I have known for over 30 years now. For the sak 

Mama’s boys. Many people find it so cute, but I think it is immature and often even borderline pathetic. These are the kinds who cannot keep anything deep or close within their marriage without running right away and telling Mommy about it. It’s like there were three persons in that marriage. Whatever their wives may do for them……Mommy can do it better! Their wives lovingly cook them the best dish they can? ……Mommy cooks it better! And god forbid their wives express even the slightest emotion anywhere short of complete praise for their mums? ……Run and go tell Mommy! No this is no parody. There are so 

I may be the perfect person to answer this question, because I am a man and I have been a horrible husband. I know the traits I had, that made me such a horrible husband. Selfishness.DishonestySelfishness (I may have mentioned that already)Evil competitivenessSelf righteousnessNot a teammateThese are all the traits of a shity husband and I was a master of them all. I will spare you most of the details in an answer that could take me the next month to write and I’m sure would exceed the word limit on Quora. So, here is the “Readers Digest” version. I was the most selfish human being on the planet,  

Based on personal experience and observation, I outline the following men who will make lousy husbands: Men who make jokes about being married. How many men have we heard make jokes about how marriage confines men or how it “shackles” them permanently? Oh, and how many times have we heard the “old ball and chain” used to refer to a lifelong commitment? A lot of men have not only expressed this joke in speech; some have even worn it on their clothes, such as this classmate of mine who wore a T-shirt with a graphic of a man sitting in misery as he’s shackled to a bride and the caption, “Game Over

You’ll find that horrible husbands are generally horrible humans once you break down their barriers for outsiders. This isn't a ground breaking concept. Everyone has their exterior face for everyday people. Then they have another layer to people they know personally and the final layer to which is their core personality exposed to their immediate family and closest of closest friends. The qualities these men have are generally negative. A lack of patience.Next to no manners.Lack of empathy and consideration for others including suppossed loved ones.Inability to express positive emotions including

At my great grand parents 80 Years wedding anniversary 6 years ago. I asked them what was the secret to their long time partnership. My grand dad simply said . Money. Always observe how they react when they lose it. I know this might touch a nerve. But I have become accustomed to this now. And now Understand what they meant about that statement. Which now makes it evry easy to know that this person is going to be a horrible. husband. One thing we all known is man are ego driven.

Fun boyfriends make the most horrible husbands. I’m not necessarily talking about “bad boys” (although they can be included in this set). I’m talking about fun boyfriends who expect the fun to never end: the starry-eyed dreamers in a band, Walter Mitty romantics (“Let’s buy a bunch of cabanas in Belize and go live there!”), the guy who’s been writing the Great American Novel for ten years, thrill-seekers, adrenaline junkies, travelholics, and the guy who refers to your traditional day job as “sounds boring—how can you do that stuff all day?”. Anyone highly impractical, without a scintilla of gra 

I was married to an emotionally abusive husband and we split up after two years. When I look back at the early days of our relationship, I realise that I should have spotted some signs that he was going to be a bad husband. I am listing a few of them below in the hope that they will be read by Indian women going for an arranged marriage, particularly if there is a gap between engagement and marriage. If this answer is useful to even one person who is in a predicament similar to mine, my purpose will have been achieved.  The signs that a man is likely to be a horrible husband are : He seems disint

How did you serve divorce papers to your spouse?
I knew it was going to be ugly, but I had no idea just how ugly. And there are some who are going to call me a cad or asshole for what I did and the way I did it but…there’s WAY more to it than just serving the papers but I’ll leave that for another story. I knew she was screwing around, and would more and again. She never cleaned the house at all, and the laundry was stacked waist-deep on both the floor and the counter in the laundry room. I had finally figured out that she was one very hot, sexy, gold-digger, who was going to get anything she wanted with minimal contribution. And she created  

I was the one being served. My Ex and I had been separated for 2–1/2 years at that point. I wasn’t focused much on divorce as I was in college and very focused on it and getting through. I had asked for a divorce a full year before, and he had simply disappeared for that year. I’d seen him once in that time, when he showed up at my school (and right before a midterm). For him to find me away from school he had to be stalking me, because he didn’t know where I was living. I’d moved 20 miles away from where I’d been before. As it was an urban area with millions of people, he couldn’t just run acr 

Mine were served to me in the lobby of my own office - at my company… the company I owned 50% of and that my soon to be ex- thought that she could get 50% of my 50%. This backfired on her. First I was blindsided that we were even getting a divorce… as she’d been lying, cheating and manipulating me. When the process server served me I took possession of a sealed envelope, singed his receipt and went into my office and called an attorney friend. She asked if I’d opened the envelop, and I told her no, which was true. She warned me that there was likely a restraining order in it that would legally  

We were amicably getting divorced. I moved into the extra bedroom when we told the kids. Things were pretty low pressure. We went to an initial meeting with a mediator, filled out the basic papers, and made the decision that I would be the Plaintiff. We paid the $35 for a sheriff to come and serve her. One day, I was reading in my room, and there was a knock on the door. I answered and the sheriff asked if “Karen” were there. I said, “Hold on.” I went to the back yard, where she was working on her garden and told her that the sheriff was here to serve her the divorce papers. She stood up, duste 

We didn’t have to. We used the same lawyer. Heck, we’d been partners for over 20 years and raised two kids together. There’s no way I’m going to fight. I told the lawyer that “Everything I have is hers. Although I don’t make a lot of money if she is ever in need, of anything, she only need ask. If I’ve got it, I’ll give it to her.” And I meant it. We had gotten engaged at 17 and 18 years of age, married at 20 and 21 and had changed markably over the years. The cost of our divorce, total, including filing fee was $863. The lawyer fussed a bit, “Heck, I’m not going to make any money off you guys.”  

The divorce paperwork wasn’t the hard part. She was pregnant with another guys kid when I was finally able to pay for the divorce so I had to wait for the kid to be born before I could file. She decided to put my name on the birth certificate even though neither of us had seen each other for over a year. I was unable to have paternity put into the divorce so I had to deal with that at a later date. I literally just mailed her the paperwork and she signed it. Then came the headache and confusion. She got married less than a week after the divorce was final with the guy she cheated on me with, so 

Even if you’ve never been divorced before and haven’t had any legal troubles, you’ve probably heard the phrase you’ve been served. In the legal context, it simply means that some sort of paperwork was delivered to a person often face to face, so there is no doubt that they received it. And in the context of divorce, this paperwork is typically the complaint for divorce, along with a summons, served on one of the spouses by the other. There are several ways to serve your spouse with the complaint for divorce and the Writ of Summons, assuming you know where they live, work or can be found. However 

By the time I finally filed for divorce, my ex and I had things pretty much sorted out- we had restored ourselves to friendly enough terms to put in appearances at family gatherings on the other’s side, each of us had our own car, and no other assets to quibble over. He was earning more than I was at the time, but as I told the Family Law Facilitator when I went to have my documents looked over prior to filing, I don’t need spousal support- continuously supporting himself will suffice! My now-ex was staying with his brother and sister-in-law when I finally filed after we had been separated over 

I went over to hang out with my ex and his girlfriend, and after dinner, I handed his girlfriend the papers. She then handed them to him. Then we decided to play a video game or watch a movie…I don't exactly remember which! My ex and I decided that after knowing each other for over 25 years, that no matter what happened in the marriage, we were best friends. Trust me, after the marriage ended, I didn't think we would be speaking, let alone hanging out together! But we decided our friendship was more important. I met his girlfriend, and he had met my boyfriend. We both became engaged about the s 

I had just got back from Iraq and was stationed in California. She was back in Ohio with her family. After going to the courthouse to get all the paperwork, I flew back to Ohio, called her and asked if she could come over to my mom’s house so we could finally end it. I had laid all the paperwork out on the kitchen table. She walked in, I showed her the paperwork, and where she needed to sign. We spoke briefly, but honestly, the only part I can remember is when she told me that she melted in her boyfriend's arms whenever he picked her up. And still, to this day without knowing why…I picked her up

What is the most underhanded thing your mother-in-law did to you or your husband that she mistakenly thought went unnoticed?
This topic was made for me. So, my husband and I have been married for several years now and there’s been so much, I don’t know where to start. When I first met his family, I told him I was pretty sure they didn’t like me and I usually have a good sense of these things. He thought I was wrong, but I was proved correct. The first time I met my “MIL” was at a birthday party for one of his uncles. It’s really the first time I had met most of the family, and we sat with her and his father. She honestly disregarded me completely. Never spoke to me, only spoke to my husband about how amazing it was  

At the time when she was still my mother-in-law, her son, my then husband had just sexually assaulted me and I was back “home” from being in the hospital. I had been getting a rape kit done, getting my bruises sized up and photographed as evidence, had my clothes taken from me as evidence and having about a dozen strangers in my hospital room asking me extremely intimate questions, while my mother tried to hold in her sobs for me. This was after I spent two months of living in Hell trying to help this man. I couldn’t eat or keep food down, let alone even talk about it. I had lost 40lbs, none of 

This isn’t so terrible compared to other answers but it was her crossing boundaries nonetheless.

We had found out it was a boy and for my FILs Christmas present we had his name embroidered on a baby bib and gave it to him to let him know of our decision. He loved the gift and the fact his grandson would have his name. Let me explain why there was so much wrong with what she did. Now while I didn’t have any pregnancy issues or complications, I am a superstitious 

Not once but twice… When I married my lovely husband told me his mom would stop holding back, and say what she wanted. She really has no filter, looking back I should of took what he said more seriously. She had invited me to one of her book club meetings (I am an avid reader and moving took me to far away from my original group), I show up only to be greeted rather strangely… lots of hugs, and bless your hearts from old ladies i didnt even know. I sat near my sister who was already part of the group, and after the meeting explained everything to me. Apparently all the ladies come half an hour ear 

Thanks for the ask, Judith. There was a wedding in our extended family at my father-in-law’s and mother-in-law’s native place. My in-laws had not visited that place liesurely after they had migrated to Mumbai about 70 years ago, and most of the youngsters had also not visited their village, hence there was a lot of excitement in the family to attend the wedding. Train tickets were booked for about 20–25 people. The wedding was going to be a three day program. On one hand my husband and I were looking forward to the trip as we had never gone on such a trip with his relatives since we moved back  

I married my second husband in 1978, and he adopted my daughter, who was two years old at the time. Some years passed, and we had a little girl together. Outwardly, we looked like a fine, young, healthy and happy little family. But the marriage was crumbling. I don’t know exactly when it happened, I think it was slow to come about, but I eventually realized that my husband was a very sick individual when it came to sex. He tried to engage me in things that were not for me…. he loved to play the “Master” and for me to be the “Submissive”. He loved violence during sex and wanted me to penetrate  

My mother (not mother-in-law) sneaked Jehovah’s Witness propaganda literature into my five year old daughter’s school bag. this was a big deal because she knew we were raising our daughter in a neutral way to allow her to be able to make her own choices when she was an adult when it came to religion or fairy stories etc. My mother had been a wild child growing up in the 60s and was into drugs and a rather hedonistic lifestyle. She was rebellious and exceptionally wilful and disrespectful and just plain horrible as a teenager. She had me when she was 21. She was pregnant with me and high on LSD w 

Hi there, Judith Engelstad! It was so uncharacteristic of her that I remember it till now. My husband was transferred to Penang for work. I quit my job, moved there with our 2 children and had our 3rd child there. Penang is also my mother-in-law’s hometown so she would come over from KL and enjoy a nice reunion with her family and friends. I was a ‘hausfrau’ so I enjoyed driving her about amidst sending the children to all their activities and tending to the baby. She took a four hour express bus ride from KL and we picked her up at the bus terminal. She stayed for about 2 weeks max usually. Whil 

Where to begin…. Within 5 minutes of being introduced to my mil to be she advises me that she had already picked out someone for her son. And basically was told to go away. Mind you, this was in California and this is a typical Caucasian family. Several months later it was Thanksgiving. My doctor had threatened to hospitalize me with pneumonia but my guy pleaded with him. He promised I would stay on the sofa under a pile of blankets. His mom however was very angry that I didn’t prepare a full meal for him. She told everyone I was lazy….. for decades! We wanted to get married on a cruise but opted 

I guess we all have a different type of relationship with our inlaws. We are friendly with each other so I don't have to many things you could consider underhanded. My husband tends to have a bigger temper than I do so I have often noticed that his family will ask me to ask him to do things. Or ask me to borrow/buy this or that for them. Although they have convinced my husband to buy cars off of them before we had gotten married. My husband's step dad has a habit of buying alot of vehicles and when one has a problem he no longer wants to deal with he sells it to my husband. Since we have marrie 

What is a stand you took with your in-laws that you will never apologize for?
My stand was not with my husband’s parents, but with my brother in law’s wife. My husband’s family is very tight knit. They will close ranks pretty quick when they don’t have a warm fuzzy feeling about someone. They have always kept her at arm’s length. She always behaves like she is the queen of the world and everything has to be her way. After my husband and I had been married a little over ten years, BIL, wife and their sons came down to visit us in South Carolina. I prepared for their visit for several weeks in advance. I had sent them pamphlets for places we liked to visit so they could pl 

Im 25, mom of 3, all under age 5, and breastfeeding all 3. Its not uncommon that im wearing panties, and cowgirl boots, or pj bottoms and cowgirl boots around the house. Okay. My house. My boobs. My husband likes it, the kids rush in for snacks, my husband doesnt allow me to wear bras, and Im over being shy about it. Im topless when the boys are here much of the time ( my husbands friends), or my gfs. My inlaws-mom and dad, arrived unexpected one day, catching me in panties only, cleaning. Without thought I invited them in before any effort to find a shirt. You would think the She-Devil arrived. She  

I met my then boyfriend at 18 and we became quite serious quite quickly. However, he had quite pushy parents who wanted him to join the military. His whole family had been in the military but he was of a lot more sensitive nature and it wasn't something he was actively engaged in pursuing. After some discussions we agreed we would move in together instead. This was quickly vetoed by his parents and before I knew it I had a ring on my finger and was 300 miles away from home. My husband started to travel a lot and everytime he came home, he became more and more withdrawn. We’d have conversations

My husband fell into what appeared to be a mid-life crisis a good 10 years ago. He became withdrawn, unhappy, bored, and unfulfilled with life in general. He emotionally disconnected from his parents first, then my family and his friends, and then from me and his kids. It's like a switch was flipped and he became another person overnight. At 40 he quit his job as a managing director for a big company and he started his own company which based him frequently overseas in Poland many months a year since 2015.

My stepson. I am married to a man whose son was 7 months old when we got involved. When his son was 3 years old, we got married. My MIL refused to allow my husband's son to be involved with me claiming to anyone and everyone that I would not be a suitable mother to him. When my stepson was 9 years old, he was finally allowed to live with us. He was given a call collect card to use to call his grandmother if I were to ever physically discipline him. When my parents in law came to visit he would always be expected to take time off school as compensation because of some grievances I had done agains 

Actually my first in-laws were wonderful people. I will never apologize for, nor regret caring for them both. Neither of them lived long enough. Clyde, my first husband's father, was a wonderful man who would quite literally give the shirt off of his back to most anyone who needed it. He would often invite people over to their house for a meal, and a bed if they needed it. Doris was always willing to provide a wonderful dinner for these people, often at the drop of a hat. It didn't matter their color or their nationality. Doris and Clyde were good people. He was an Army medic who served in Vietn

Do you have an amazing story of how you met your husband/wife/partner that defies the odds?
I saved this question until today, because it's a day worths remembering. This day exactly four years ago, May 12, 2012, I met my husband for the very first time. I had a trip to Taiwan with two of my very good friends from Malaysia. And my husband travelled there with two of his buddies from Hong Kong. We both arrived on May 11, 2012. Went to the same club, Luxy on the first night, but we didn't see each other. I remember I was very drunk that night, puked in the cab and my friends had to literally drag me back to our Airbnb, cleaned me up and put me to bed. The next morning I woke up with a massi 

When I was 19 I got added on facebook one day by a stranger who lived in Lebanon. I couldn’t see his pictures, just his profile picture which was of a cartoon character. I looked at his profile page to see if maybe there was some hint as to where I might know him from. There was nothing. But his ‘about me’ and likes were so interesting. Now, I’m someone very interested in foreign countries. I had been living abroad my whole life. But I had only met one other person from Lebanon, so my knowledge of the country was limited. So I decided to write him. I told him that I didn’t know who he was and a 

When I was 10 years old I suddenly declared to my mother that I wanted to learn Japanese and that she must find me a teacher. We lived in a very Caucasian town in rural Australia - there were few Asians, let alone Japanese. My mother was understandably surprised but figured she should ride with it. An ad in the newspaper later, we somehow managed to locate the only Japanese person in town. And so it was that I came to speak enough Japanese to win myself a scholarship there for a year, which pretty much sealed the deal - I was officially a Japanophile. Meanwhile, my husband-to-be was in rural Ja 

Yup, that's right up my alley! About four years ago, I was a final year student in one of the best French prep schools. I don't know if you've ever heard of French prep schools, but that's no joke: study all the time, not very encouraging professors, and constant stress. Needless to say, I was pretty depressed. My two best friends and I decided to take a short break during the October holidays and go to Dublin. We stayed at the Times Hostel on Camden Place for 5 days. During these 5 days, the three of us got enough attention from the opposite sex, but it I simply didn't really like anyone, and w 

 Oh this one could only happen in the movies… except it didn’t. It happened in real life. I feel most qualified to tell this story from my perspective as an involved observer. Here goes, settle in: My daughter needed to escape her situation. She graduated college early, at 19, but had no idea what to do with herself. She became a virtual magnet for disaster in which bad people and problems just gravitated her way. She’d always try her best, always. Yet the harder she tried the more her life twisted—headed downward from bad to worse. After her latest relationship nearly ended her life, I suggested  

Similar to many, I spent my life dreaming of The One. Although I loved many wonderful people, I always eventually broke it off whenever I realized they were not The One. By the time I was 37, I was beginning to question my desire - is there really one true soulmate for me in the world? I was dating a lovely person at the time, but I had realized (once again) that we were not destined to be together in the long run. Maybe it was time for me to accept that my love life might consist of one long-term relationship after another, and that I should be fine with that, OR, to be satisfied with less-th 

My brother had invited me to a party with his friends. On the day, I was feeling pretty tired and couldn’t be bothered to go. My friend and I decided to show our faces for a little bit, to be polite. When we arrived, we still weren’t really in the party mood. Everyone was a lot more drunk than we were. We hung around outside in the smoking area, in that awkward, too self conscious to talk to anyone kind of mood. We decided we’d leave more or less straight away, but my friend wanted to roll a cigarette first, and she asked me to go inside and find her some papers. She knew even less people at the 

We met 16 years ago.I am  Mexican and my wife is Japanese. She is 6 years older than me and I met her when I was 15 years old(She was 21 then). Imagine the age difference at this age.  Long story short, I went to Vancouver for 6 months to study English(which actually was a sabbatical semester). Last Friday of my stay, I went to a party which was at a friend's house who was also Japanese. She was there and of course when I looked at her I liked her but of course I never had the intention to talk to her. She was much older than me and I thought she wouldn't talk to me.  A friend of mine who was a 

We were childhood friends. He was 2 years my senior. He was there when my first tooth came off. He consoled me after my ears were pierced. We looked really cute together. But I am a Hindu and he a Muslim. Not that our families are orthodox in anyway but I always had this seed of doubt in my mind. So I was always had my guard up around him. Enter my best friend. She met him on my 14th b'day and was completely blown away by him. I thought they were the best match. Same ethnicity, same b'day and my friend was stunning, I mean they both were. So I set out playing cupid. But he was just not interes 

We met by chance while I was working in North Carolina. At the time I was working at a big chain bakery store after my immigration to the U.S. My manager had asked me if I could work overnights so we could stay one step ahead of cake orders, and also so I could prepare the bakery before opening (baking bread, donuts, markdowns etc). It had been about 2 weeks of this new schedule. The bakery was due for some major renovations, which would happen during the night so as not to disturb the normal workflow. The renovation company sent in a team of workers. In addition, they sent along a security guard

How did your husband react when your first child was born?
My partner was just completely shell shocked. It still wasn’t real to us that I was actually pregnant and that we were actually becoming parents (I didn’t find out till 27 weeks but that’s another story.) I ended up going into labour at 41+3 and two days before my scheduled induction. I didn’t realise it was labour due to it being back pain only and I was having contractions since40 weeks so just brushed it off. By the time he got to the hospital (my mum drove me as He was at his flat and asleep) I had gone from 7cm which was what I was at when I arrived to 9 but was happily bouncing around on  

As my children are adopted, we never had “that” moment. Rather, we had a different type of moment. My (now ex husband) husband was in the military. We had applied to adopt and had gone through all of the necessary channels and had two ALMOSTS (where the adoptions fell through). I was home alone and got THE call. Two little girls, biological sisters, needed a home and we were the perfect match. Could we come and pick them up that weekend?! Once I collected myself and got a grip on my emotions, I called my husband at work to break the news to him. I said “Hi. Got something to ask you. Do you think 

Thank you for the A2A. My husband was crying his eyes out when our first child was born. I became pregnant after 7 years after marriage. It was a terrifying pregnancy as I had bleeding throughout my first trimester. Every time I used the loo, I was afraid that I was having a miscarriage. However, the baby was always fine and growing well. I was very nauseous throughout my 1st trimester. After the end of 12 weeks, I started to feel that things will be ok. My bleeding, too stopped.The day before my 5th month scan, my belly kind of sagged. I thought, “ Hmm, that is a bit strange.” but did not think 

I had a daughter from my first marriage when my husband and I met, so I’ll tell you about when his first child was born. I finally went into labor at 43 weeks (my whole family has long pregnancies). We dropped our daughter off at my parents’ apartment, and went to the hospital. After many hours of labor, my doctor decided that I needed a cesarean. (Whether I actually did or not is a story for another day). I was wheeled into the operating room. My husband was not allowed to come. He called both sets of parents and told them what was happening. My mom immediately drove to the hospital to be with 

I was taken to hospital the day before, as pains started increasing. It was a long wait and in the morning pains subdued. We were about to leave as the gynecologist was not cooperative. She requested us to stay back and told she would come in five minutes. We waited. She came and gave injections for pain and my little son was born with lot of screams in the hospital. My parents were sitting on the bench, outside the labor room and were crying. He was like this and that made delivery difficult..  As soon as my son came out into this world my sister called my husband “ Bava(BIL) congrats! You have a son 

On March 24th 2015 at 12.26pm my husband and I welcomed our son Oliver into the world. My husband (who has stayed headside throughout walked to the bottom of the bed to see his first born as he entered the world. My husband said afterward it was like the whole world had stopped. Right in front of him was this tiny, perfect, useless being and all he felt was love. He said watching me give birth was amazing. He was just in awe at how the female body just knows what to do. I had quite bad post natal depression but was adamant that I was breastfeeding. My husband cooked me dinner and fed me because “ 

I was in labor over 24 hours with nothing to eat and only sips of water or ice chips. During the labor he kept wanting “to take a break” but one of the Nurses that was there for the active labor and had stayed past his end of shift guilted him into staying with me as I couldn’t get up and take a break. (Thank you George wherever you are!) When I finally had the baby - and as I was in a military hospital I was starving! I was given some juice that was in the fridge on the delivery floor and told to sleep. Hubby went out to eat with a friend and didn’t even bring me anything — but came back with  

When I was carrying my daughter, my now ex informed me that the baby wasn’t his. I HAD NEVER CHEATED on him so don’t know where he got that information. The baby came out looking like his side of the family. Later, I caught HIM cheating on ME: hmmm! His guilt made him project his problems onto me. He did it with the second baby, also, which came out the spitting image of him. When he finally got a vasectomy, I was still on birth control pills. I had the prescription in my wallet as we never were very intimate (I call both of my babies miracles). He pulled it out in front of my face and accused me 

Well, my husband melted into a pile of mush on the delivery floor! (He did the same with our second.) Both our girls (no boys) have always had him twisted around their little fingers like a pretzel. Our younger will not have children, as she has developmental disabilities, but our older, who is now 35, has a 4 year old boy and another boy due in April. My husband adores the first boy and I know will feel the same about the new baby. I was fortunate to have a father myself who loved my mother deeply, and loved me as well. I was lucky to find a man who had all the good qualities of my dad, and my  

My husband was overjoyed. He had wanted children since before we were married. After 8 years of trying, we were extremely happy to be able to adopt a newborn baby girl through a surrogate. We were both in the delivery room, and tears were flowing. We stayed with her until she was released, and my husband insisted that we take her (yes, a 24 hour old baby!) to his office where he’d worked 20 years to show her off to his friends. Only then could we take her home. So to say he was proud would have been an understatement!! He’s just as proud of that 5’8” beautiful 13 year girl today! 1.6K views · View upvotes · View shares · Answer requested by Shobha Rao231Sami Darby, Homemaker  (2012-present)Answered 1 year ago · Author has 789 answers and 5.9M answer views

Is there a way to make a pwBPD remember all of the good and happy times in a relationship with somebody that they've devalued? If so, is there any chance or hope in getting them back?
Why is it so hard for one to move on and get over a narcissistic relationship than a regular one?
If a narcissist is easy to leave a relationship, what does that mean?
How do you get back at a narcissist?
The most respectful way, if you are kind to others and don't want that behavior to rub off on you, you should just not contact that person. Leave them alone. They are already suffering internally, more than you can perceive. What they think about themselves is said to you because the weight is too heavy to bare for them but that is not valid justification for abusive or negative behavior. If anything, getting them back just makes their illness worse and also makes you feel like the problem they say you are. It's a lose-lose. If a child misbehaved, do you put them in time out so they can sit and  

The best way to get back at a NPD is to move forward with your life, use this experience to learn about yourself on a deeper level, work at getting good with who you truly are and never look back. No contact. Here’s the thing - when I first began to unravel the unruly mess I was when things ended with my N, I was MAD. I was furious and all I really wanted was to scream at him to slap his face to step on his toes I really wanted to let out the rage inside of me and I wanted him to see it hear it feel it. I wanted to start a Scarlet Letter for N’s worldwide. I wanted his name on a billboard in ev 

Jamie, the best way to get back at a narcissist is, first of all, if you are carrying a load of anger for injuries you sustained, harboring grudges, including.. (the payback sort of grudges), continuous thoughts at the back of your mind consuming your every thought on “how can I make this still work?” to bargain with your anger issues….thinking.. that you still love this person sooo much that you will gladly let it go for another chance at making this relationship right or making it work. I am so sorry honey, it is not gonna happen..say and if it does, it’s only borrowed time before you find y 

I would suggest not doing it. For one nothing good will come of it. Why do ask? How do you know you are dealing with a narcissist? I ask because the term is loosely tossed around by people upset about the way a relationship ended or one considered toxic. The person is hurt and feels like they didn’t the closure or answers they want. There will be no honest heart to heart. There will be no accountability shown. When really if you are involved with a narcissist just go your own way even if you feel like doing something it won’t make you feel better. I guess that would be the best advice and reve 

All these people are gonna tell you this “no contact, move on and don’t look back” jazz, and it’s true, but they don’t understand. There is a difference between getting revenge vs getting justice. Revenge is petty and to be honest won’t bring a lot of satisfaction long term. Getting justice is different though. It’s more than just you. It’s how this person violated not just you, but basic humanity. It’s something beyond you. This monster is going around smashing up other peoples lives with no freaking consequences. No freaking blotch on their record. No trace of their abuse not just of you, but  

How to get back at the narcissist, how to get even or make them feel how they made you feel or at least give them a dose of their medicine! If you had a penny for every time a survivor asked themselves that question you would be rich for sure! The problem is if your talking about getting the narc to be EMOTIONALLY hurt or negatively affected by something you do to them then there is only one way to do so! In my opinion the best way to make a narc feel totally defeated by you and actually feel emotional pain, shame, embarrassment, guilt or maybe even regret is to FULLY expose them to the world or 

Be very careful trying to get revenge. A narcissist is a pro at games of revenge, has had many years of practice at deceit and manipulations, and has little or no boundaries. Even if they seem angry, they enjoy these games. Anything you do will be used against you to make you look like a crazy, bitter ex. Hell, half the time you'll be blamed for stuff you didn't do. Someone said post a bad review of him online. if he gets a bad review, he's gonna blame you whether you wrote it or not, and then he's gonna show everyone that bad review and tell everyone that his crazy bitter ex wrote it because s 

By far the most effective way is to act like the hurt never happened, and you are simply not bothered by what they did. That is a tall order when you are screaming inside, but it is devastating to the narc if you can pull it off. The narc is meant to control you and your world, and you are supposed to be destroyed if you ever split. Act like you are not, and the narc’s world order is upset. So if you ever bump into him or her, instead of glaring or bursting into tears, you give a big smile and a cheery wave, then sail on (things to do, places to go). You will leave behind a very confused narc. 

This question is actually a “catch 22” as consciously “getting back” at a narcissist is actually feeding their supply. You see, you wouldn’t feel the need to exact revenge if they hadn’t already succeeded in “winning” by upsetting you. It’s the functional equivalent of telling your childhood buddy his mom wears army boots after he denounces yours. Fucked up, right? Welcome to the world of narcissism! Where absolutely nothing is as it appears &amp; lying, cheating, manipulating &amp; controlling are the rules of this sick &amp; twisted little mind game.

I am getting angry right now. What should I do if a Korean girl wont date me? 😡
I am getting angry right now. What should I do if a Korean girl won’t date me? Calm down and leave the girl alone. There’s probably a reason why the girl doesn’t want to date you. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t find you attractive. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t like your personality. Don’t take it personally; after all, not everyone’s going to like you back. But if you only want to date a Korean girl because she’s Korean, then that’s just plain stupid and it makes sense why Korean girls wouldn’t want to date you. You’re literally fetishizing them.

Imagine a woman who you are not attracted to in the least, demands that you date her, and when you decline her offer, she becomes furious with you. You would think she has serious anger issues, you would be thankful that you avoided her, and she is a jerk. EVERYONE of us has liked someone who has not liked us back. Each of us has the right to say no, no matter how much the other wants to date. That is how it goes. You will survive this.

Learn to not! It's most likely an indication you are not happy with yourself. Let her go! Now work on yourself. You are mostly perpetuating the problem. You need to be okay with rejection and be positive about what you do have. A bit of gratitude goes a long way. So what do you enjoy doing? Go do that and let her go! There is more to life that expecting people to fall at your feet. Just you do life and if she doesn't want to part of it..her loss.

mainly, no offense but this is true, Korean families only look in people for their good jobs and their income like a doctor who makes 200k a year they would consider them a part of the family but if not you know they would just dump you. This wouldn’t be an offense because back then in ancient times they believed in power and wealth also mainly if you don’t respect the Korean culture and you don’t approve the eating ways then that’s a reason why they don’t want to date you and also begging and forcing wouldn’t make it better. 83 views4Cynth GrehnAnswered March 23, 2021Originally Answered: I am lonely and angry.

I saw this question/vent like for so many times and I assume you’re the same guy. Listen, first off if you’re in Korea, try dating apps. It might probably help you. I mean don’t lose hope, there are many half Koreans and half black kids so there might be a chance you’ll find one. It might take some luck or timing as well. Or just accept that korean girls might not be for you but you can try other asian girls that has a resemblance of korean girls features.

I guess it’s because those girls that you are desperately wanted to date refuse to date you because they’re scared of you or because they’re not ready to be in an interracial relationship with you. 69 views · View upvotes4AnonymousAnswered March 23, 2021Originally Answered: I am lonely and angry.

Man I try to help you, and you still keep asking the same stuff over and over. You are a goner man. You are done. Nothing more, I can say or tell you, because you are too autistic. Maybe one day you will realize your actions and see why you are still lonely. 81 views · View upvotes5Angela Susanne, studies Business (2026)Answered March 22, 2021 · Author has 1.3K answers and 207.5K answer views

Can a person who was never loved as a child accept love and give love in a relationship later in their life or will it always be 'alien' to them?
What is the weirdest thing a girlfriend has done to make sure you were not cheating on her?
What comment made you realize your partner was having an affair?
What is the most BS excuse you've heard someone use after cheating?
Lol when I was with my ex we had one of my ex friends live with us for about 2 months. She was hard on her luck got kicked out of her place. I used to work 2nd shift and she worked 1st and he worked odd hours. So one night while I was at work I started to get very sick with the flu. So they sent me home very early. I come home to them both in the shower. He comes out first surprised to see me home. I ask was she in there too. He said and I quote yes but she got in when I was coming out. She comes out and I ask when did u get in the shower she said about 20 min ago. They were having shower nookie

It wasn’t after, but before cheating. It was about noon. I picked up my 3 year old from preschool. I’m driving down Watt Avenue and as I’m driving I see my ex’s silver Toyota Tundra with an Air Conditioning unit in the bed. As I’m driving toward his truck I see him pull over next to a bus stop and he’s talking through the passenger side window to a blonde Russian or Ukrainian woman. She gets into the passenger side and I’m still several cars behind. I’m stunned! I automatically think this is a secret girlfriend who just didn’t have a car, so he was picking her up. I was FURIOUS. So I pull into 

“I missed my grandpa” I kid you not. His grandfather passed away, we went to the funeral. The next day his boss sent him and his teammates to Spain for work. He was there for five days. He comes home and acts like nothing is wrong. Unbeknownst to me, he goes to work and over lunch, he tells his friends how he hired a hooker in Spain and his wife has no idea. He got away without being caught. Some of his friends got up from the table and moved to another table, the rest of them told him what an asshat he was because he had a great wife. From then on, they had no respect for him. Fast forward two m 

These are some of the most inconsiderate or childish things that I heard from people cheating on their spouses. That there was no more connection. What does that even mean? I mean a cable can lose connection and can be reconnected. If a spouse feels that they have lost connection with their wife/husband. If they still love them, they must seek help to reconnect again, and the help to restore the marriage.That the other person is hot. Well, there will always be another woman or man who is hotter than your wife/husband. So even this one who is hot now will eventually become like any other woman/m

4 years ago I immediately ended an 8 year relationship. The short and quick of it: I used to keep my digital voice recorder sitting on top of the dresser. We used it once to record his lying ex . For proof of her behavior as they were constantly in family court for whatever stupid crap she would make up. She had a habit of coming over and throwing raging fits with him. The recorder was moved and sitting on my side of the dresser with the light blinking. So, I thought he recorded a message for me. Nope. His 5 year old daughter had recorded him talking to his brother. Telling him he had impregnated  

I usually read but this question strikes me. My mother has a horrible taste in men. Her boyfriend is some convict who is in and out of jail. He assaulted one of my exes and can’t hold down a job. I’ve seen him push my mother and my family agrees he’s probably done worse. He’s cheated on her multiple times and she always stays. When I was about 17 or 18 I moved in with her briefly. She was lonely because her boyfriend was in jail (again) and I was getting ready to move multiple states away. My ticket outta there overlapped him getting out of jail so I had to be around him for a few weeks. I hated 

I was there to witness it firsthand from an acquaintance. The most BS excuse I have heard someone use after cheating was because they felt like their partner was lucky enough to be with them so she HAD to put up with him cheating. My jaw dropped. He went on to tell his girlfriend that she wasn’t good in bed, she was annoying, and had the audacity to continue to belittle her by pointing out her personal flaws; things that weren’t meant for public ears. She immediately left crying and I followed. She was completely devastated and couldn’t believe that the person that meant the world to her would  

Quite simply, I haven’t. At least, I haven’t heard an excuse. My husband cheated and there was no excuse. He was genuinely sorry and remorseful and wanted us to seek counseling. He didn’t try to blame it on me. He didn’t come up with excuses. He accepted the blame. In fact, he said, “You did nothing to deserve what I did. I was wrong. And if it helps, it was so hard for me to do that to you.” I knew we were fighting and breaking up at the time and were engaged, then. So I sort of got why he did it, albeit I never understood why he settled for her because she really was quite homely. And honestly, 

My ex and I had just had our son. One night, one of my friends came over. My ex's friend was also over. They were all drinking. I was breastfeeding so I could not drink. I went to bed around 11 because being a new mom was exhausting and I had to sleep since I was the only one taking care of our son. If I asked dad to do it, he'd get very mean about it and be rough with our newborn, so I was terrified he was going to hurt him. Ex said he'd be in bed in a bit and I left them to it. I woke up around 4 a.m and ex isn't in bed. I go to the living room and find his friend passed out on the couch and  

What is the strangest way you found out your significant other was cheating on you?
Traveling panties. I'm a guy. I've had a fair few lovers and yes, that tends to make future ones a little more leery about trusting me. So when my girlfriend left town for a week and came back to me handing her another woman's panties, her assumption made sense to me. The thing is, I hadn't cheated. She had, and not with the owner of the panties! Obviously upon my discover they weren't hers, which made holding this kind of rough, tiny pair of panties out to her one of the more awkward moments in my life, I had to find out where these panties came from and why they were in my home. I called exes, 

I was busy at work and had planned to cook my wife a Mexican dinner, I had never cooked Mexican before and here in England in the year 2000 it wasn’t a common thing, anyway there I was smiling and working hard when out of the blue at around 11 am I got a text saying “ hi darling how was your holiday?” Now call me silly but my heart sank and I instantly knew something wasn’t right, it was our 1st wedding anniversary and we had been together for 13 years before that!! Now I knew I hadn’t been on holiday since our honeymoon and I’m pretty sure she might of noticed if I had of been, my head was sp 

I found out my boyfriend was still talking to his ex at a funeral. A mutual acquaintance came up to me as I was leaving and said: “Hey, are you and Steve still together?” (not his real name) I said “Yes” and paused before following it up with “Why?”. “I talked to Keisha (his ex - not her name) two weeks ago and she claimed that they were back together.” Irritated by the ex’s relentlessness I casually replied “Well, she wants him so badly that she has probably convinced herself that it's true. It's quite delusional and pathetic, really. Please tell her I said that.”. I knew her game. I knew that she 

My 1st wife went out with her single friends. A lot. Often. One night she came back home from a night out and did married couple thing. It felt like she had been at it earlier and I commented on it. I didn't realise it but she had just been found out. A couple days later she made me breakfast and casually stated she wanted to tell me something. She told she had been having an affair for 3 months and that night had a quick and dirty go with some guy outside a nightclub. She asked forgiveness. I forgave her but was shattered inside. I warned her that should it ever do it again she would be histo 

I was dating this woman exclusively and were in a committed relationship. She had started into this relationship with a bit of trepidation. She had told me that anyone she dates lasts three weeks and she’s onto the next one because the guys manage to do something within that time to have them go their separate ways. This was validated by her friends who didn’t want to get too close to me because they knew I’d be gone soon. She was a divorced mom with a bubbly personality and easily fun to be around. I survived the initial three week period and her friends warmed up to me. We were with each othe 

What is the strangest way you found out your significant other was cheating on you? Eight months prior to making the mutual decision of getting a house together to begin living our lives in together, I’d thought it best to break it off with her. There were some pretty heavy duty red flags and a significant event that resulted from those red flags that still had me second guessing the decision to get a house together even months later after the event. The red flags were many deliberate attempts to try and use triangulation games (all played off as harmless and innocent) to get a reaction out of m 

When I was 19, I thought I had met the love of my life. E was handsome, funny, tough.. my young heart did not stand a chance. Our relationship moved quickly, very quickly. This being my first serious relationship and E, being ten years my elder, I took his lead. I was completely infatuated with him, like grossly. He just thought I was pretty I’m sure. We moved in together within a month, that I paid for. E had every excuse in the book of excuses as to why he couldn’t work. This did not inconvenience me in the lease bit. Taking care of him made is what made me happy, my happiness was completely  

Well, it may not be strange more so as my inner Sherlock Holmes suddenly appeared. I had been dating my now ex fiancé for just about a year and a half. In the very beginning of dating, she cheated on me at a work party. I was well aware of her cheating ways as we had a very open beginning to dating. When that happened, I chalked it up to nerves of starting a long distance relationship to a man with 2 kids. Boy.. I was wrong lol. So flash forward, we continued dating after that event which I also just knew happened based on how she suddenly went silent for days. We began to date more seriously,  

My ex and I started dating in June 2015. I was 19 going to be 20 and he was 22. I met him at a very low point in my life and for a long time I thought he was a god send and he had saved me. We were together for 3 years and 4 months and we broke up October 2018. There are several parts to this story so bear with me In the Summer of 2017, I cheated on him. I went to a party got too drunk and made out with a dude on the couch. That’s as far as it went and later I went home. I need no one to tell me it was a low and shitty thing to do. I felt awful about it, the ride home was sickening and I had to 

We had been married 17 years at the time and were good friends with another couple and had been for about 8 years when it all happened. She had suffered betrayal by her husband several years prior but they worked through it and seemed to be doing ok until she started telling me she had a ‘crush’ on a city cop in town. I told her she was playing with fire. She would tell me things he would text her (2001–2002 so texting was new and exciting then) in confidence but then I would go home an tell my husband what she said and he would just say, ‘she’s doing exactly what K. (her husband) did to her.  

My mom is cheating on my dad. I told my dad about it. My mom is mad and she said they're fighting because of me. She said that I should say goodbye to my college next year. Did I do the right thing? What should I do?
I have one VERY VERY solid and loud answer for you love , Nothing in your parents mess is you fault , NOTHING . Make a big sign and write on it “ MY PARENTS LIFE AND RELATIONSHIP IS NOT MY FAULT “ and post it on your closet door . The way you see it well and they see it once in a while . Let this become hardwired in your young brain. Your mom could have cheated on your dad , ten times a day and make sure you never ever learn about it . You found out because she WANTED you to find out . She gave it away just enough for you to find out , knowing that being a child ( even if you are twenty five ) y 

Sweetheart, don't feel bad about what you did. It may not have been the best thing, but you did nothing wrong. When we know a married couple, and learn that one of them is cheating, it puts us in a terrible position. You can say nothing, but when the victimized person finds out, and then discovers that you knew about the cheating and didn't say anything, you're seen as the bad guy for enabling the cheating to continue. You can say something to the victimized spouse, but that risks that person being angry with you for being the bearer of bad tidings. (The kill-the-messenger response.) You can s

Growing up, my father had anger issues that he struggled to control. He didn’t physically* abuse us, but he would take out his anger/frustration on physical things around us. Once, for example, my sister and I left our bikes out overnight in the rain instead of putting them in the garage like we were supposed to. He threw the bikes across the yard, grabbed a sledge hammer that was near by, and proceeded to smash them up because obviously we didn’t care about them anyway, or we would have taken care of them. Another time I was vacuuming when I was seven, and I was doing a terrible job and missi 

I was in a situation just like this 3 years ago, only it was my dad cheating on my mom. When I found out I told my dad he needed to tell my mom himself or else I would. Two days went by and my mother was still clueless. (For some reason I've always been that sibling that's the bearer of bad news but I could never get used to dealing with the aftermath.) I spoke with my dad over the phone the day of, I told him I knew he hadn't said anything to my mom and I was about to, he begged me not to, came up with countless lies, and even cried out loud over the phone pleading me not to. I told him if the 

Like others have said, a child is almost never at fault for problems between parents. It is very easy to blame the child because the child will actually believe it. Have you ever heard of root cause analysis? It is often used in business analysis to determine causation of something that happened. A simplified technique for applying root cause analysis is to ask “why” 5 times. With a bit of thinking you can apply this to your situation too. I don't know your circumstances, so the questions below are only an basic guideline to how you can apply this principle. If there are multiple answers for a q 

There is a lot of judgemental people here, but I'm going to give here a different point of view. What happened with your parents is their problem and unfortunately none of your business. I believe it is a tactical mistake you told anyone, and should have sat on it quietly and feigned ignorance if ever asked about it. You however weren't BAD for telling the other parent, just ignorant about how it would explode in your face. As we grow up we learn that some things aren't about good or bad or right and wrong, they're about being wise and minimising damage. People cheat on people for a plethora of

My parents fight constantly. They don’t let up. They throw things at one another, both of them have stormed out of the house and have broken things, it’s horrible. And what’s worse is they blame me for all of their problems. Each and every one. Even if they don’t relate to one another. Bad news? My fault. Food’s burnt? My fault. It doesn’t end, and it can be quite strainin 

Oh boy! What a horrible situation for you to be in!! On top of finding out that your mom is cheating on your dad you have to deal with her anger. That is not only difficult but also a bit unfair.

You did the right thing by telling your father. I have no idea what it has to do with your going to college next year unless your mother is just trying to make you feel as bad as she does right now. Just know that you did the right thing no matter what happens between your parents and/or college. I wish I had done the right thing by my father. I regret not telling my father when at 14 years old I caught my mother having sex with a family friend on our couch in our front room. I’m 49 years old now and it’s the only thing that I regret so far in my life. I found out about a year and a half later t 

What made you cheat on your partner? Did you feel happy or guilty after cheating on them? Did you ever confess?
I was married to the love of my life for 5 years. We had a daughter together. We had our ups and downs but we remained rock solid. This was my happily ever after. But I ruined it. I went on a trip with my friends from school. We decided to go on a road trip. Though nothing happened on the trip, but my married friends told me all about how exciting their life was with an extra-marital affair or with weekly prostitutes. They told me all about how a new woman in your life lights up things, and you try out new things on the bed. They told about how, after having babies, most women aren’t able to be  

In response to the gentleman who bravely shared his great loss after infidelity: Thank you for this. I think many women like myself wonder how a seemingly happy man can risk (or, as in your case, lose everything) for the hope of greener pastures. It is easy to judge people, but the fact is that more than half of marriages end or are threatened by infidelity. Ironically most of those same people hypocritical think of themselves as basically loyal, loving people. Maybe they even ARE most if the time. But what we do when under pressure I.e. our core values are challenged, IS what we really are beca 

What made you cheat on your partner? Did you feel happy or guilty after cheating on them? Did you ever confess? I am a firm believer that it takes 3 to cheat. Guys or gals who blame it on a drunken night out? I'm calling B.S. Why? Because you obviously had some control over your faculties if you were able to navigate to a secluded spot n remove enough clothing to have sex. You did the deed bc you saw something in the guy or gal that you were not getting from your spouse whether it was something as vacuous as needing a little passion or as damaging as being treated like furniture for years.

Did I cheat on my partner(s)? Yes. Twice. Did I confess? Once, yes. Do I feel guilty about doing what I did? NO. I am a 25 year old female. I was seeing a guy but there was no commitment. We would have a lot of sex, hang out together and talk for hours. I knew his friends and family and they knew about me. Over time I started realising he is very dim witted and couldn't take any decisions by himself. He has said I love you to me many times but he had also said he doesn't love me the same numbers of times but he never committed to me. It had been 3 months since we started going out and since he di 

I cheated on my first boyfriend. When I was 19, I thought I had found my match. My boyfriend of the time was significantly older than me, there was a gap of about 6 years. He was funny, loving, caring, and loyal – or so I thought. He was really accepting of me and my disability, because especially at that age I craved for acceptance, so that mattered to me. It was really important. We dated for a good 2 years. During the first year of our relationship, he introduced his “sister” to me. Sister is in quotations because she’s not related to him. His “sister” was actually his boss’s girlfriend. My e

Firstly I did not cheat as he never said or accepted we were in a relationship. I came from a small place where people who are intimately close are in a relationship. Because people come closer intimately only when they're in a relationship.He kept confusing me all the time. Sometimes treated me like shit. Sometimes treated me like Queen. So I didn't know if he was with me or not.So Yes,I met some one in between when my ex and I were not talking for few months. It was nothing more than friendship which quickly escalated to physical relationship. He initiated (read begged). And it's easy to say

when I was in high school I met my s/o and we dated for 5 years. He cheated on me the entire time with several different people. No matter how many times I caught him it never ended. I was totally blinded by love, as mushy as that sounds. I have never met somebody that was so much like me, into all of the same things. We had too much in common. I always thought he was my soulmate and I wanted to believe I could fix him. He was a notorious cheater who blames his childhood for his actions, I thought I could change him. After 4 1/2 years, I was so fed up with him just being treated horribly and him 

It was a long distance relationship. We had been dating for 11 months. He had a legal case over his head, in which he was the defendant. The accused. He was my first serious boyfriend. We were 18 and 20 when we met, and by the end of it he was 21 and I was 19. I tried to look at it through rose colored glasses. “After this is taken care of and he’s proven innocent or gets the charges dropped, we can both save money and move in together”. I really thought I was going to marry him. But then I met someone. I was 19. He was 26. We met through a mutual friend at work. He was actually the roommate of  

I lived in the same city with my boyfriend. We were happily in love. He was the perfect boyfriend, had time for me, cared about me and loved me so much. Once when he travelled overseas for business, I had an ex who is also a friend over and somehow we ended up having sex. I wasn’t even attracted to him yet somehow I still did that. I think I was curious because I’ve not had much experience sexually and my boyfriend kept undermining his “prowess” in bed. I felt so guilty immediately it was over. I mean, it wasn’t even half as good as when my boyfriend and I made love. I was filled with so much  

I am cheating on my spouse and don't want to stop. What should I do?
I was in that situation. It started simple - walks, lunches, and looking into each other’s eyes. He listened to me and payed attention to me. I imagined for months what it would be like to kiss him, to feel his body next to me, to have sex together. Three months later I was completely in love and it felt so amazing I did not want to stop, so I understand what you mean. What should you do? I’m not familiar with your situation, but I can tell you what I wish I would have done. You have to be honest with yourself and your spouse no matter how painful or unhappy it makes both you. Lying and cheatin 

As someone on the receiving end of such a transgression, I’d ask you to take a moment and truly analyse your actions. I’d ask you to perhaps, imagine what it is like to be your spouse. My husband did this, at a time when I was very newly pregnant, 6 weeks to be precise. When I found out, I was visiting my parents. I tried to get a hold of him, I needed comfort but mainly, I was panicking that I was going to miscarry. He’d told me he was having a boys weekend. With his cousins. I thought nothing of it. We were both absolutely petrified at the idea of becoming parents. The space to be with others 

So, you’re cheating and you don’t want to stop…chickenshit move, all the way around. I’m answering this assuming you are the only cheater. If it’s both of you, that is a whole nother set of problems. Pull on your grown up panties and BE HONEST. With yourself, your spouse, your kids and other family members. No matter what you do, you have destroyed the trust that is vital to a committed relationship. Since you don’t want to stop..don’t, you selfish whore! But do your partner the courtesy of a quick and clean divorce if that’s what they want, and all the alimony/child support you can muster. Don 

I was married for twenty three years. I used to joke and say that “The secret to a happy marriage is discreet affairs.” I was a major fool for saying that, and a bigger asshole for believing it at the time. I read all of the stuff that you are getting in the responses here. The truth is you are going to do what you want and no amount of cajoling, lecturing, yelling or screaming is going to change your mind. You already stated that you do not want to stop. Neither did I. Even though my wife found out about my affair and begged…literally begged…for me to come back. I was such a fool. I was in the mid 

Please seek professional help or leave your spouse. The big question is, if you don't want to stop CHEATING on your spouse then why do you want to keep this marriage. What purpose does this union serve you? Is it convenience? Clearly something important is missing or maybe you're overwhelmed. This type of behaviour is honestly despicable and frankly reckless. Betraying on the very person who is supposed to be your closest confidant and best friend in your life makes no sense whatsoever. There is absolutely no JUSTIFICATION for cheating as you always have an OPTION to divorce. You're not coerced 

Many interesting answers to this question. No doubt you have read the answers and maybe even made a decision. But here is something all humans need to understand now. As a society, we need to move on from romanticism in love. Romantic love makes a person feel wonderful in the event those feelings are reciprocated. You feel it with your lover, you felt it with your wife once upon a time. Romantic love is also a beautiful illusion. It’s put there by nature in order for us to reproduce. It also dies. Eventually. It lasts about 18 months, sometimes less and sometimes a little longer. The idea of mak 

Well, you really should stop using instant build hacks when playing competitive matches with them. Oh, wait. ‘cheating’ also refers to ‘having sex with someone without asking everyone that you are also having sex with if it’s okay to do so’. …There are weird ‘xtian’ answers likely in this thread~ This will not be one of them. Sex is sex. The allure of ‘it’s forbidden’ is one reason people ‘cheat’. Another can be that they just don’t get enough of it or feel attracted with lust to their current partner. Is your entire relationship with this person, your ‘spouse’, based around sex? Around shared resou 

Well first of all thank you for requesting an answer from me. I am not sure what I can tell you which will make a huge difference to you personally as you have already stated that you don't want to stop! Let me ask you this, why post this question on quora, what can myself or many others on here tell you that YOU deep down should already know yourself!? Your love for your wife and family should be enough to make you want to stop, the vows you took should be enough for you to stop, your marriage and memories should be enough for you to stop your own morals, values and strength of character should 

It is a reflex and easy to say: “it’s cruel, selfish to continue - get a divorce and at least stop whatever will cause that great pain your spouse will eventually experience.” This response addresses the immediate ethical concerns about life/family stability, honesty and the peace of mind which both partners deserve. But something should be added - things are complicated; if they weren’t, word would have gotten around by now. Someone who is cheating on a spouse with determination is doing so for reasons that cannot be summed up easily. Despite what we like to believe: Marriage is a dynamic process,

Hey! I’m a kid. I’m 17 to be exact, and my parents have been divorced since I was 6. I’m not sure if you have children, but just in case you want a child’s perspective- here’s mine. My father cheated on my mother. When I was about 3, he’d regularly take me to his mistresses house, where I’d meet her daughter and we would get acquainted. I could barely speak, so there wasn’t any chance of me telling her, or even recognizing that he’d broken his commitment. I can’t remember how my mother found out, but I do remember how often they’d fight, and how much pain my mother was in during the end of their  

My husband cheated on me and I decided to forgive him. We just found out that the woman is pregnant and now my husband wants her to move in with us. Should I support him?
I’ve been that other woman, the one who got pregnant. That was nearly 30 years ago, and I have a different perspective on the whole situation than I had at the time. Wife, get the hell out of that marriage. Your husband might, on some level, love you, but he does not respect you. If you stay with him, you’ll be putting up with this kind of behavior until he’s too old to get it up. You will never be able to trust him. As you cling to him, hoping to save your marriage, you are wasting time—time that you could be spending in a good relationship. I’ll bet you’re worried you’ll never find anyone els 

You have gotten some great answers already. Since I have been in a similar situation I will add my little bit. I discovered that my husband was cheating, and told him I wanted a divorce He said that his dream had been to bring his mistress and her children to our country to be able to alternate living with ’his two families’. I realized I had no idea who this man that I had been married to for 20 years was. He told our children that he found me ‘old fashioned’ for not even wanting to entertain the idea. And then my world went from being a quiet suburban life as a bureaucrat and married mother o 

“Support him” in this plan? Probably not. I think your order of prioritization of well-being should be: the babyyourselfyour husbandyour husband’s girlfriend and co-parentSo, what is best for the baby? The baby will need loving adults to take good care of it, both in the sense of nurturing it and paying for its upbringing. Would you like to help parent a child? If yes, then talk to its biological parents — your husband and his girlfriend — about what role they would like you to play in this child’s life. What are they offering you? If you would not like to raise a child, then it’s certainly bes

My husband cheated on me and I decided to forgive him. We just found out the woman is pregnant and now my husband wants her to move in with us. Should I support him? This is such a sad and incredibly devastating scenario — both to you, the wife, and the (possibly unknowing), definitely trusting other woman who is in an affair with him. She was quite possibly lied to. Perhaps, it would be easier for all of you if your husband provided and paid for, housing (an apartment) and hired help for the woman (who is pregnant with his child out of wedlock) as he is actually still legally married to you, hi 

I first discovered evidence of my ex wife's dishonesty when I was using her laptop one day; my monitor had cracked and it was being replaced. I was 27 during these events. While I was buying books on Amazon, an instant messenger tab popped up on the screen from one of her ex-boyfriends asking how her day was going. I recognized his name because a year earlier he tried to harass me on Myspace (back then, Myspace was as big as Facebook is now) when our relationship was getting serious. Then i decided to look deep into it, i picked up her cell phone which she pass worded all of a sudden without my  

Good morning…..My first response to you would be “ Are you crazy or out of your mind?” But I've been attracted to someone toxic like your husband and know how we omit reality for the dream state they put us in or the dream state we have put ourselves in. If he wants her to move in to YOUR HOME, it's because he sees her, has discussed the move with her and pretty much can bet you will be amenable with having another woman push you out of your own home. He is no longer yours…..he belongs to her body and soul, until he walks into some venue and meets a hot blond; then she and the baby will be hist 

“My husband cheated on me and I decided to forgive him. We just found out that the woman is pregnant and now my husband wants her to move in with us. Should I support him?” It depends. What does your boyfriend think of this? My husband told me that he didn't want to be with me anymore so I started seeing someone else. All of a sudden he's telling me he wants to work things out, should I tell him about the other man? In May 2019 you were pregnant with 3 weeks to go. Yet you had a baby in March 2019. Color me impressed: I just gave birth to a girl two months ago. My friends and family have always  

If your question is serious, the answer is entirely dependent on only one thing. Your goals for the rest of your life. You have a choice here, and I might add it's a strategic moment, one of those moments where the decision you make has profound and often are irreversible implications for the remainder of your life. Is your is your goal for the rest of your life Journey, to be one of learning, growth and expansion? If the answer that question is yes, then you should provide absolutely no support for this absurd proposition, and seriously reevaluate your husband's intent for the rest of his life 

An unequivocal and emphatic NO. Indeed, it’s hard to understand why you are contemplating the possibility. Looking ahead, at some point in the near future, a child will arrive, who invariably will become the centre of attention, as will the mother. You will then be irretrievably relegated to number 3. You already are at number 2, by dint of his amazingly self-centred request to keep his mistress in your house). You would be allowing to have you husband have his cake and eat it (twice). The quality of your relationship with him will diminish, as will your self-esteem. Your husband could easily st 

What is the brutal truth about extramarital affairs?
Brutal truth? They are natural. Harsh, but true. Think about it. Humans are descended from apes. Apes are pack animals with alpha males and little sub-societies. The alpha gets the ladies until he is toppled but the lesser males certainly get their chance sexual encounters whenever possible. The females take it all and have their own little groups within the group devoting themselves to rearing the babies together. But we have evolved from that! We have complex society and thousands of years of marriage, etc. We have become monogamous. Have we? For most of the time we have had complex societies, m 

The brutal truth is that is pure destruction. It destroys people both the one cheating and the one being cheated on. It destroys relationships, sometimes relationships far into the future. It even destroys children who come from the homes that get broken. I have never once cheated but came very close without knowing it. In my case my wife who I was having issues with pointed out what was going on and I was able to put a end to it before I was about to put a very nasty spot. I was having problems with my wife and another woman, my receptionist at the time got in between us using my issues with m 

Disclaimer: many but not all of these things apply to all relationships, same gender, women cheating, etc etc There are unique features to each one. I am going with what I know. For a single woman who is considering having an affair with a man who you know is married: WARNING before you proceed because these are possible outcomes You will not be a sympathetic figure to some women and this isn’t anti-feminist. Because you are also hurting a woman. This isn’t slut shaming either. I deeply resented appeals to my feminism by female colleagues because did somethingly wildly selfish. I am not suggesting

In most cases there is no brutal truth other than the VERY brutal truth that almost everyone have been in it, have done it and stayed married. I always think about the story written in the Bible some 2000 years ago: he who has not sin (committing adultery) can throw the first stone (at the women caught in it). Everyone went home. :o) - well, people say today. That was then, and Jesus he did not mean only the sin of adultery - he ment all sins. Did he? Really? I guess there is not much new under the sun —- and some want to learn, others simply are happy as they are… some want to become faithful. M 

The truth is every affair is different. For some it’s just an escape from their unhappy wife/husband and stressful day to day life. For some it’s about sex others about feeling loved and appreciated for who they are without anyone else interfering. For some it’s pure love others money and age. Brutally honest those affairs/relationships are all different and you can’t generalize. I do not condone cheating in any way shape or form but I did find myself in this situation without even realizing before it was too late. For me it was all about feeling loved and having someone to talk to about anything 

Every situation is different but this is what I know from my experience being on both sides of it, Before you ever enter into an affair you damn well should have made every effort to fix your marriage first and left if it wasn’t fixable. There’s never an excuse for an affair. When you are in it it’s incredible, you feel alive for the first time. If it’s long term and grows into true deep intimacy and love you need to leave your marriage ASAP no matter what the situation. That is the ultimate betrayal and no matter what patch up job you try to put on your marriage after it will never be what it sh 

From reading lot of reddit, quora, and google articles Here is the brutal truth about extramarital affairs. Affairs are becoming common these days, Even in between happy couples. Why? Thanks to social media.  So, why affair happens in the first place? No lack of emotional attachment between couple.No physical intimacyLack of understanding between couples.Taking each other for granted.These are just some reasons, If they want to cheat they will cheat anyway. Lets see a story of a housewife ( A real story) Housewife name is Latha, Latha is a married to a well educated, rich, handsome, funny and a good 

￼You remember that quote from the movie “The usual suspects” “The Greatest Trick the Devil Ever Pulled Was Convincing the World He Didn’t Exist?” What if it didn’t stop there? What if all it really was was a contest between God and The Devil. Like in “Job.” Call it “Job 2 the re-fucking-match.” So, ok, What if that was indeed the Devil’s greatest trick? No doubt it’s a great trick. Top that God. Ha! But wait...What if God did? I mean he is God after all. So think: What trick could God pull to beat the devil’s greatest trick? How about this: What if God convinced man that love is a good thing. N 

It can impact your life in the worse imaginable way. My experience is from the other side. While I was in 11th &amp; 12th classes there was this lady D in mid 30s known to my mom, &amp; I used to go to clarify my doubts in one of the science subjects. In first year of engineering we again that subject for one semester &amp; for some reason my mom insisted that I visit her to clarify doubts, so I did.

Following is one of the some incidences which I've witnessed. A couple came to reside in our area. Aged around 30 something.Married for around some 7/8 years. Had two cute kids. A son and daughter of age 5 and 3. Everything seemed to be good,what any typical Indian man would want. A stable job, a homemaker wife and two kids who'd jump up and down your belly after you return home from work. This guy worked in some IT company. So naturally it made him maintain a lifestyle which the society and friends were supposed to admire. Atleast that's what he thought. Good job, hi-fi friends and some sort of 

What is the strangest way you found out your significant other was cheating on you?
Traveling panties. I'm a guy. I've had a fair few lovers and yes, that tends to make future ones a little more leery about trusting me. So when my girlfriend left town for a week and came back to me handing her another woman's panties, her assumption made sense to me. The thing is, I hadn't cheated. She had, and not with the owner of the panties! Obviously upon my discover they weren't hers, which made holding this kind of rough, tiny pair of panties out to her one of the more awkward moments in my life, I had to find out where these panties came from and why they were in my home. I called exes, 

I was busy at work and had planned to cook my wife a Mexican dinner, I had never cooked Mexican before and here in England in the year 2000 it wasn’t a common thing, anyway there I was smiling and working hard when out of the blue at around 11 am I got a text saying “ hi darling how was your holiday?” Now call me silly but my heart sank and I instantly knew something wasn’t right, it was our 1st wedding anniversary and we had been together for 13 years before that!! Now I knew I hadn’t been on holiday since our honeymoon and I’m pretty sure she might of noticed if I had of been, my head was sp 

I found out my boyfriend was still talking to his ex at a funeral. A mutual acquaintance came up to me as I was leaving and said: “Hey, are you and Steve still together?” (not his real name) I said “Yes” and paused before following it up with “Why?”. “I talked to Keisha (his ex - not her name) two weeks ago and she claimed that they were back together.” Irritated by the ex’s relentlessness I casually replied “Well, she wants him so badly that she has probably convinced herself that it's true. It's quite delusional and pathetic, really. Please tell her I said that.”. I knew her game. I knew that she 

My 1st wife went out with her single friends. A lot. Often. One night she came back home from a night out and did married couple thing. It felt like she had been at it earlier and I commented on it. I didn't realise it but she had just been found out. A couple days later she made me breakfast and casually stated she wanted to tell me something. She told she had been having an affair for 3 months and that night had a quick and dirty go with some guy outside a nightclub. She asked forgiveness. I forgave her but was shattered inside. I warned her that should it ever do it again she would be histo 

I was dating this woman exclusively and were in a committed relationship. She had started into this relationship with a bit of trepidation. She had told me that anyone she dates lasts three weeks and she’s onto the next one because the guys manage to do something within that time to have them go their separate ways. This was validated by her friends who didn’t want to get too close to me because they knew I’d be gone soon. She was a divorced mom with a bubbly personality and easily fun to be around. I survived the initial three week period and her friends warmed up to me. We were with each othe 

What is the strangest way you found out your significant other was cheating on you? Eight months prior to making the mutual decision of getting a house together to begin living our lives in together, I’d thought it best to break it off with her. There were some pretty heavy duty red flags and a significant event that resulted from those red flags that still had me second guessing the decision to get a house together even months later after the event. The red flags were many deliberate attempts to try and use triangulation games (all played off as harmless and innocent) to get a reaction out of m 

When I was 19, I thought I had met the love of my life. E was handsome, funny, tough.. my young heart did not stand a chance. Our relationship moved quickly, very quickly. This being my first serious relationship and E, being ten years my elder, I took his lead. I was completely infatuated with him, like grossly. He just thought I was pretty I’m sure. We moved in together within a month, that I paid for. E had every excuse in the book of excuses as to why he couldn’t work. This did not inconvenience me in the lease bit. Taking care of him made is what made me happy, my happiness was completely  

Well, it may not be strange more so as my inner Sherlock Holmes suddenly appeared. I had been dating my now ex fiancé for just about a year and a half. In the very beginning of dating, she cheated on me at a work party. I was well aware of her cheating ways as we had a very open beginning to dating. When that happened, I chalked it up to nerves of starting a long distance relationship to a man with 2 kids. Boy.. I was wrong lol. So flash forward, we continued dating after that event which I also just knew happened based on how she suddenly went silent for days. We began to date more seriously,  

My ex and I started dating in June 2015. I was 19 going to be 20 and he was 22. I met him at a very low point in my life and for a long time I thought he was a god send and he had saved me. We were together for 3 years and 4 months and we broke up October 2018. There are several parts to this story so bear with me In the Summer of 2017, I cheated on him. I went to a party got too drunk and made out with a dude on the couch. That’s as far as it went and later I went home. I need no one to tell me it was a low and shitty thing to do. I felt awful about it, the ride home was sickening and I had to 

We had been married 17 years at the time and were good friends with another couple and had been for about 8 years when it all happened. She had suffered betrayal by her husband several years prior but they worked through it and seemed to be doing ok until she started telling me she had a ‘crush’ on a city cop in town. I told her she was playing with fire. She would tell me things he would text her (2001–2002 so texting was new and exciting then) in confidence but then I would go home an tell my husband what she said and he would just say, ‘she’s doing exactly what K. (her husband) did to her.  

What has been your most unexpected betrayal and what did you learn from it?
I have been badly betrayed from some one whome I loved as my brother. I am answering this question anonymously. I am an orphan women. This incident occurred when I was in orphanage. I was aged 21 years and I had no one to call my own. But there was a 18 years old boy who gave me the respect of an elder sister. I always blind folded belived in him. I know him since he was just 12. One day during Saraswati puja I worshiped goddess saraswati and obviously I had to wear a saree, so that whole day I was wearing a saree. Usually that boy (I will not name him) comes to me and talks but that day he cam 

I was going through a very rough time mentally and emotionally. I had just lost the best job I ever had (when the economy collapsed several years back) AND my girlfriend had just left me for another guy. I was a mess. So my (only) brother invited me to come and live with him for a little while out in California until I got back on my feet. He had a great job and and talked to his boss about hiring me once I got out there. Cool. A new place, a new job, hangin out with my bro. Sounds great. Well, my brother had a girlfriend at that time (who I never liked and fortunately he’s no longer with her) 

I thought long and hard before writing this answer, but it was a betrayal that changed my life for the better, so perhaps others can learn from this as well. When his best friend is actually money In 2013 was contracted by my best friend’s startup company to manage a specific section of five large infrastructure project tenders. I was told that the client can be difficult to deal with as he is an extreme perfectionist. The short version is that, after making a big mistake and having had to eat a big ol’ chunk of humble pie, I found my rhythm and ended up doing really good work. In the end the cl 

I came out to my closest friends, and all but 2 accepted me. The first one immediately rejected me - by backing away and yelling how disgusting I was in the middle of a busy cafeteria - but the second one wasn't too quick. Let's call her Maggie. I came out to Maggie by casually saying that I was bi, and my girlfriend at the time subsequently came out as a lesbian. Her parents raised her on stereotypical “conservative christian” values, which happened to include treating queer people as sinners. She was a little freaked out in the moment, but she simmered down really soon. Throughout the duration 

Without going into explicit detail to reveal too much identifying information… I started a role not long after the loss of my father. I was still pretty deep in bereavement, and trying to rebuild my life and the career I had put on hold to spend time with him before his death. I wound up working with an ex that I had an extremely bad break up with several years before - when I say extremely bad, I mean extremely bad. I would have been very happy to spend the rest of my life never hearing from her again; I don't think she quite understood this, but hey. Having not had any contact (blissfully so), 

I debated for quite some time before I decided to answer this question. Then I debated whether to answer it anonymously, however, both of my parents have passed away, and there isn't anyone that would be hurt by the revelation of this. Then I debated on who was actually betrayed. Sometimes I debate a lot….. Anyway, here goes: Ten years ago, my husband, son and I uprooted our family, my husbands job, and our entire lives to move to Northern Michigan. We had always planned to do this one day, but “one day” came much sooner than anticipated when it was discovered that my mother was diagnosed with  

This may be a story that everyone has, as the rate of people cheating is increasing and sadly it is very common, I will tell it any ways. I met a girl who is the cousin of my friend from school when I came back to my home country for university. We instantly hit it off, I am really shy and she was the one making the moves. I didn’t find her pretty, but once we started dating, she was so attractive, I couldn’t get why I never found her pretty. With her I was so comfortable, I became myself with her, I was so in love, I couldn’t imagine ever being without her. I was really clingy as well, I felt 

I have been debating in my head whether to write this answer or not. Mostly because I have never hated her for this, and will never hate her. It is not in my ability to hate her. Betrayal is a feeling which can be best described as a kick in the guts, but the pain and scars never heal. I met her two years ago, through a penpal website. We instantly clicked-we could talk for hours. We became very close friends. She was the most knowledgeable person I knew. But I always knew she kept secrets. She never actually told me her name. She insisted that I should call her winter. It stuck. Mind you, I di 

My relationship of 4.5 years ended about 6 months back. For the last 2 years we were in a long distance relationship. The relationship ended mainly because my girlfriend wasn’t happy about me questioning about 2 (out of the many) of her guy ‘friends’. The reason I questioned her was because she had lied to me in the past about a variety of things so I was finding it difficult to trust her. Something in me told me that things were not as they looked. This led to a lot of fights and we decided to end it because I couldn’t trust her and she thought I was insecure. The day after we broke up - one o 

2 stories… A Best friend: I had a best friend that I had been friends with for about 3 years+ who also happened to be gay. This particular friend (we’ll call him Dante) had been diagnosed with HIV the year prior. I always felt really bad about that and wanted to do nice things for him when and while he was feeling good. Most of the time on the meds he would get easily sick or tired 70% of the time. He also partied more than the average person so there was that too. I had received a large payment from a client and I decided it would be fun to celebrate my birthday (Feb) in Spain. I knew that I’d  

What should I do? My GF is saying that either we get married or she will dump me. We have a 7-year relationship but I'm still not ready to get married. I love her but she is leaving me unless we arrange a wedding in the next 3 months.
Every relationship gets to a point where you decide to get married or break up. Both of you need to break up. I was in your girlfriend’s shoes. Thankfully I wasted 2, not 7 years of my life with a guy. Those types are never serious nor ready for that level of commitment but too scared of being alone. Same thing; had the DTR with him. Later he surprised me with a beautiful proposal, but shortly after, the engagement was extremely stressful; nothing changed. One day he’s like yes let’s get married and next day oh I’m not sure. It was exhausting. Wedding planning helped me get away from that stress  

Been married several times and I’ve got to give you two ends of the spectrum. On one hand, marriage is for suckers. I mean you’ve been with her for 7 years. What have you not done that you can only do in a marriage? File joint taxes? Guarantee each other’s inheritance? Visit in the hospital? Get on the other’s insurance plan? All stupid reasons to get married. You mentioned something about different countries? Immigration is actually a good reason to get married. Other than that, a cynic would say it sounds like she’s got other plans for you or your fortunes. He’d say “If I was in your shoes, I’ 

My grandma had a saying for this. “Shit. Or get off the pot.” If you don’t know that you want to marry a woman after 7 years (!) of being in a relationship, then you need to figure out your mind and fast. I told my (now) husband after less than a year of dating that I was going to have to make a job decision in the next few months. I needed to have a firm decision from him on whether or not we were going to get married or not before I decided to stay where we were living at the time or move back to be closer to my family. I was not staying without a ring on my finger, or at least a firm propos 

Your gf said that to you? You mean your “girlfriend”? 7 years, and she's still your “gf”. Wow! Seven years she's been acting like your wife, you've been treating her like a wife. Sleeping in her bed each night, nursing you through sickness, washing your clothes, sucking your dick…. 7 fuckin' years you've been sucking the youth out of her and you don't respect that woman enough to ASK HER to honor you by becoming your wife.., and she wants to get married. She should have left you a long time ago. You are abusive and self-centered. If after 7 years you “are not ready”, then you really need to give her 

I had a fiancé just like you. He wasn’t ready after many years, almost 7. I one day got sick of his not being ready to just grow up and figure out what he wanted in life and I left him. Two years later (after being with HIM for 7) I was not only married, I was pregnant. No joke. So all these years later, I am happily married to someone else with a child. Coincidentally, my ex-fiancé lives 7 blocks from my new house. We stayed friends on FB, and I got a little concerned about the fact that we both live in the same small town. I looked up his address, wanting to be sure I wasn’t going to run int 

Wow this sounds familiar. I also had a 7-year relationship, in which she wanted to get married and I “wasn’t ready to.” I have to say, your girlfriend is being pretty kind, respectful, and vulnerable to express her needs to you. My girlfriend simply got frustrated, and ended the relationship. In fact, I think most women would just leave. What you have to understand is that your girlfriend loves you, but she also has important life goals which include marriage and probably family. These are very important to her. What you should ask yourself is “Why am I not ready?” For me, there were some important as 

This is a tough &amp; hard question to answer since so many variables can affect you &amp; your decision so I’m just going to try and do this on a basic and “Man to Man” kind of talk. As you’ve said, you have a 7 year long relationship and I will presume that you &amp; her are “In Love” , that you both do truly care for one another and enjoy time spent with each other and consider the past 7+ years a good investment of time. You then need to ask yourself “Why am I not ‘Ready’ for Marriage”? What is holding you back ? What are you afraid of ? What else do you feel you need to do before you feel like you wil 

I knew a guy once that was in a 5 year relationship but he just wasn’t ready to “settle down”. I talked with him a bunch of times about it because he was such a nice and kind guy and the girl was the love of his life and he would only ever get married and have children with her, he said. He couldn’t explain why not now. She was patient and seemed to be okay with the arrangement though. Fast forward 6 years. Whatever barrier makes the thought of being committed so impossible to him has not diminished. She is now in her late-ish 30s and he knows she wants kids. So he tells her she should forget h 

This is such a great question and I’m so glad you made the decision to ask it. NEVER let someone pressure you into marriage! PERIOD! Marriage is a TREMENDOUS commitment and an AWESOME responsibility! If you are not ready, you are NOT READY! NO ONE should pressure someone into marriage and, quite frankly, no one should WANT to pressure someone into marriage! People who want to get married, but are with a partner who feels they are not ready, can ALWAYS leave and go meet someone else, but NO ONE should ever pressure someone into getting married! Let me offer you some thoughts. Many women and men  

Generally, I think giving ultimatums are distasteful. However, context matters, and in the context of a 7 year relationship, I don't think its particularly unreasonable. What you need to do is to be honest with yourself. Question 1: Do you want to marry her? Possible answers: No. If this is your answer, I think its obvious that you have an irreconcilable difference. Your relationship is over, maybe it even lasted too long. You have to accept this and move on, and allow her move on.Maybe/I'm not sure. If this is your answer, we'll come back to that shortly.Yes, but not in 3 months. This also requir

How do married people stay in love with their spouse when they are old, wrinkled, and grey?
I’m not quite wrinkled yet but I’m definitely past mid-life so the grey hairs have well and truly taken over. My husband and I have now reached the point where we’ve been together longer than we’ve lived apart. We met in Santorini, Greece, a few decades ago, when neither of us were necessarily looking to fall in love. He was on his way to Gallipoli to visit his great grand-father’s grave, while I had just finished university in France and wanted to spend the rest of my summer in Greece. He was the first person I remember meeting on my second day on the island. I suppose everybody was new and i 

Hmmm… let me try to answer this. When I first met my wife I thought she was crazy beautiful. I was not, however, in love with her. I didn’t know her but saw her from afar. To me she was like beautiful art. Truly gorgeous. Then I got to know her. We became best friends first. No sexual relationship. Just friends. I then learned that she was truly beautiful inside also. This is why I began to fall in love with her. It was not because of her looks, it was because of the person she is. So now we have been married for 27 years. Perhaps she is not as physically beautiful as she was back then. She is, h 

If you marry your spouse of the same age give and take about five years different then you will grow old together. Men and women will have wrinkles , white hair, arthritic joints, and all signs of ageing. If you have loving kindness for each other then you will be together until death do us apart. You will have your children to comfort you in your old age. Many men in their fifties committed adultery normally with a woman young enough to be his daughter because of unrealistic expectations . Be realistic it is your dollars which will attract some of this young women to your old body . Many an o 

I can only speak for myself and not for old, married couples. I’m still young and unmarried, but here’s my input anyway. I do not plan to marry any woman for her physical appearance. I want a woman with a certain type of personality and mindset. Physical appearances change over time, but good personalities can remain the same or even improve as spouses grow older. I will always associate my future wife’s physical appearance with her positive qualities which I’ll greatly treasure for life.

When I met my now wife, she was a young 26year old with long blond hair, she was the most beautiful person I had ever seen and way out of my league. Anyway I started to chat to her online, it was wonderful even though I was 16 years her senior she made me feel at ease with all we talked about, I had just come out of a loveless relationship and honestly thought I would be alone for the rest of my life. As time passed I grew close to her Sam, and looked forward to getting home from work every day so I could log on and chat to her, I would tell her about my day and she would tell me about hers, I  

You begin by choosing your partner wisely. You don't settle. You must ask yourself: Is this person the love of your life? Is this person someone you find difficult to be apart from? Is this someone who compliments you and your lifestyle? I've heard people say about the companion they're with, “She's (or he's) a good person.” Yes, that's all well and good, but it's not enough. Do they light a fire of passion within you? Do you find it hard to keep your hands off them? Next month, my wife and I will celebrate 47 years of marriage, although we've been together a lot longer having met when we were 

Being in love isn't the same thing as being in lust. All people get old and grey if they are lucky, there is no avoiding that. There is also no human right that states that we all deserve to be with someone that stays hot for their entire life. Doesn't it sound silly to expect that when you think of it that way? Everyone would be single, that's not even feasible. When you love someone, you like their personality and being with them. That doesn't necessarily go away. If you were attracted to them in the beginning, that attraction is strengthened by love. An old grey husband still looks like his y 

If you need a perfect, in-context example of what love is, read James Meszaros’ previous response to this question. If you want to understand on a more conceptual level, I’ll try to explain here… To begin with, this question conflates love with lust. And this is problematic. As a former high school English teacher, I used to spend quite a bit of time working through the difference with my students. (Note: this conversation wasn’t off-topic, as Romeo and Juliet was part of the core curriculum.) This is what I used to tell them: Sonnet 116 by William Shakespeare (reprinted below for ease) is the mos 

In the event that you marry your better half of the identical age give and take about 5 years different then you'll definitely grow old together. Both women and men may have lines and wrinkles , white tresses, arthritic bones, and all signs of ageing. When you have loving-kindness per other then you will be together until demise do united states aside. You will have your young ones to comfort you within old age. A lot of men within their fifties committed adultery normally with a female younger adequate to be their girl as a result of unrealistic expectations . Be practical it is your dollars  

Old, wrinkled, and grey? Sheesh, sonny. I bet you're a real charmer with the ladies, eh? Come closer, I can't hear ya. Ok, well…because it's too darn annoying to get up and move and start all over when you're old, wrinkled, and grey. That's why! Your joints ache, your back gives out on an almost daily basis, and gods forbid you should trip over something. You'll fall and break your dang hip. That hurts! Have you ever fallen, and not been able to get up? It's not nearly as fun as it sounds, let me tell ya. For the ones that last, part of how it happens is that you've been together for years, you 

Did you ever fall in love in a war zone/deployment?
What happened in that moment when you realized you are in love with your significant other?
I was friends with my boyfriend for a year before we got together. We talked every day. We went out together. We laughed together. I loved him - as a friend. Four days after we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend, exactly one month ago, I had a date night planned with him, but his roommate got sick, and we had to cancel. I was in the middle of moving into my flat, and had no furniture, food, or stuff to do. He stopped by at lunch time with pizza, flowers, strawberries, and ice cream. We ate, using a moving box as a table. We cuddled on a blanket on the floor. He told me I was beautiful, cal 

When I realized that I was in too deep. We started dating during my senior year and his first year of college after knowing each for three years. I had been single for a long time with the intention that I was not going to continue dating just to prove that I was worthy of having a boyfriend. Sure, dating happened, but the other parties knew that they would not become my significant other. He wanted a relationship with me and was forward about it, clearly stating his intentions. That got my respect and I told him that we could explore our options and if a foundation existed for trust and respect 

I had just gotten back from being away from home for about 10 months. My ex, who I lived with during that time in New Orleans, Louisiana I had caught cheating and needless to say I was in pretty rough shape. I was very confused, very hurt, and so very tired from being up for 48 hours. Thankfully the drive back home gave me much needed time to think and process what had happened but the one thing that I kept coming back to was being excited to be going back home. Despite being in that state my thoughts always strayed back to my best friend and I couldn’t contain the feeling of being absolutely e 

If you were to die tomorrow, I would treasure these two amazing dates we’ve shared. And, if you were to die in a month, I would have had a month to get to know you. And, if you were to die in six months, I would have had the chance to fall in love with you. Anything after that is icing on the cake. Those were the words she used to tell me that she was comfortable dating a man with late-stage cancer. Here we are. This photo sits in a frame at the top of the stairs to our second-floor living room, in our home.  In May of last year, I was in dating mode. I had a profile on a few dating apps, and I ha 

I've known my boyfriend since I was twelve years old. We were friends for a year or two, then we started to be friends who held hands, and then friends who kissed, and as we got older our relationship just kept changing. We still talked about history, watched Hank Green videos together, and fought over the proper way to solve social justice issues, but we physically started to be closer. We never dated, but we knew we were friends who also had feelings for each other that weren't platonic. We blamed it on teenage hormones for a long time. Sometimes we would stop doing our friends with benefits 

I had known my husband for 6 years before he finally asked me out. There was an opportunity where we were both single and finally set our sights on each other. I had gotten my wisdom teeth surgically removed the morning after our first date. I developed serious dry socket infections in all four gaping wounds in my mouth where the teeth were dug out. It was the most painful and horrible experience of my life up to this point. Childbirth didn’t even come close. My mom was looking after me in the days following my surgery. I couldn’t function from the pain, couldn’t get out of bed, and I kept throw 

The first time I saw her…well, our eyes didn’t meet, I was straining to catch some more subtle elements. Her thick wavy hair won’t permit, they sheathed most of her face. Some days later, our eyes met. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I was transfixed for a little longer than normal. She claims to have no memory of it though. The day I heard that coy girl speak for the first time, I loved it. That was the day I took up that botched up mission of asking for her notes, ended up asking her equally pretty friend. I quickly transformed from an insignificant-nobody to a buffoon, that wasn’t funny at al 

Ours was a complete arrange marriage. During our 10 months of courtship (a long distance one) though we got along well but I was not entirely happy with the course of our relationship. It was not anything even an inch similar to what it is shown in movies or I have seen happening with my cousins and friends, where the two people either since day 1 or sometimes later are in head over heels love with each other. I even confronted him regarding my insecurity to which his reply always remained the same, he constantly made me understand that we are living apart and contacting over texts/phones so th 

When i realized i actually wanted to do things with him, when i was willing to put in effort. Before my current boyfriend and i began seeing each other in December’s 2018, I was having a rough year. Had just graduated high school, had spent 10 months of that year in an unhappy relationship where i was abused, undermined, and ignored. I finally told my ex to hit the road when our 3 year anniversary had rolled around and I was drunk 3 hours away from his university. It was a difficult breakup. He stalked me for months after. Sending me pictures of his self mutilation, walking all over his city at  

I missed her. We were friends for years, having met in church. I always got the feeling that she liked me, but she drove me crazy. We kind of drove each other crazy, actually. We were asked to lead church events together, because we were good at it, but that often led to fights because she had trouble seeing how often I had the correct perspective on things… :-) She was about as different from me as anyone could be, so if there were two ways to do something, guaranteed we each chose a different way. We had lots of fun dates over the years with our other friends, just casual stuff. Game nights, di 

Do parents automatically love their child?
How do I negotiate a healthy relationship with my partner despite the fact that I don't want to help him raise his daughter? My daughter is now twenty and I am finished with raising kids. I do love my partner very much and want to grow old with him.
I once dated the male version of you, except I didn’t realize it at first. He approached me, well aware that I had a four year old daughter. His own children were adults. I assumed he was ok with the fact I had a young child or why else had he approached me? But no, he informed me he was done raising children and ready to retire. That he loved me and wanted a future with me and wanted to marry me. When I pointed out he’d just made two diametrically opposed statements he assured me he hadn’t. That he wanted me but not the responsibility that my young daughter would bring. I informed him that if h 

You don’t. You can’t have a healthy relationship with the love of your life while excluding the people he loves the most in this world and expect him to be fine with it. My wife and I are both people of faith, born again Christians. There are many flavors of Christianity, and ours is of the belief that your spouse comes before your children. I know this may tick off some people, but do hear me out. When I met my now wife, she was a single mother of a beautiful 6 year old girl. Back then, we weren’t established in our faith, but we still gave each other the respect we wanted from the other. I knew 

I was that child. My “mother" decided that this dashing man in uniform was more important than her daughter. Yet, still, she would not allow me to go and live with my father. At first, he was just cold and uninterested. He ignored my attempts to interact with him and my mother told me to leave him alone. He then began to discipline me “for" my mother. His preferred methods were physically beating me; dragging and jerking me around by my hair; and mental and emotional degradation and humiliation. Keep in mind I was a young child. They married when I was 3 and this began during the first year of t 

Surprisingly, I've seen this work out but not in the way that you may think. One thing I have to ask how old is the daughter because that can change things. Also there is a difference between treating her as an unwelcome house guest/stranger versus literally being a second mother. If the daughter is a teenager or older, it's easier as they understand the concept of these boundaries to not expect you to be their actual mother. However if you think that you can ignore the daughter completely and pretend she doesn't exist, or think that you may never ever be in a position where you feel responsible 

Hey there! I have a relatively contradictory answer to some that you have received. Here’s the thing - people have a knee-jerk emotional reaction to step/blended family questions and often individuals hold very contradictory and impossible standards for step or potential step parents. On one hand, they want you to love the child like your own, but on the other hand you are to never discipline the child and step back from an actual parental role. What actual researchers say is much different, at least from what I have read. What Wednesday Martin explains in her book, Stepmonster, is that trying to 

When I was 21 years old I married a man ten years older than me, who had a 9 year old daughter. She was a spoiled only child and I honestly didn’t wish to be a mother. First few years we had her only two weeks each summer plus a long weekend during her Christmas holiday (we lived out of state). When I was 24 years old, my stepdaughter along with her mother (my husband’s ex) and the man her mom had married were in the crash on a small airplane he was piloting. Her mother and stepfather died in the crash but my stepdaughter, age 12, was found alive (it took 24 hours for the plane to be found as  

You aren't going to be able to have a healthy relationship with your partner, because single parents and their child/children are a package deal. Both my grandmother's were single parents at different points in their lives, and at a time period during our history that was considered taboo to date or marry someone with children from a prior marriage. My maternal grandma left an abusive husband when her son was just a few months old and filed for a divorce, when her son was about 4 years old she met and fell in love with my grandfather and it wasn't long after they got married that my grandma beca 

My mother died when I was ten. My brother was nine and my sister, who has cerebral palsy, was four. My father married a woman who had 17-year-old daughter a few years later. Her daughter was already married and had a baby. They dated off and on for a couple of years before they got married. It took a lot of persuading for her to marry him. He mostly stayed at her apartment when they were dating and left us kids on our own. I prayed for them to get married when they first started dating. I missed my mother so much and wanted my father’s girlfriend to be a mother figure to me. But by the time th 

I left a relationship with a man who was my everything. I told him I was a packaged deal as I had twin sons who, at the time were 2 years old. He lovingly accepted my sons along with me. My sons loved him and he was terrific in every way in raising them. However as our relationship grew, he wanted me to fly off to any part of the world for extended periods of time with him and leave my sons with their father. He is an anesthesiologist and did free work in areas in need. I also had started a new job as a RN at the time we met and had zero vacation accrued nor could I take off for extended time. I 

Well your choice is this, you either love and accept all of him, or you don't and move on. All of him includes the aspects about him you may not like. This also includes the people he chooses to have in his life including his daughter. You choosing this man also chooses his daughter. You can not have him and only him. You can not keep the bits you like and discarge the rest. Love doesn't work like that. He is a package deal. If there is some aspect you really don't want to deal with then the relationship is incompatible. Incompatible means it's not going to work between you two. This is especiall

Never faced these sort of situations till today in life but yes I have many sisters and have seen them go through this phase. None of my brothers have reached the age of getting married. So, no idea about boys. Disclaimer: This answer is on a light note. Ques. 1. What are your qualifications? ( I don't know why this question is asked. Though they come to her home after reading her bio-data thrice, still this question.) Ques. 2. Would you like to work even after getting married? This is a trick question and most of the things are judged on this. If the answer of girl is affirmative, then girl is calle 

Last month only I met this girl (it was my fourth arrange marriage meeting). Since first three are not worth discussing I am jumping to worth discussing one. I live in Delhi but my home town is in Madhya Pradesh. I am CA by profession and 29 by age. So was taking help of my parents in getting hitched as my relation didn`t worked out. My mom told me her friend`s daughter is a year less than you and looking for match I am sending you photos and bio. She seems decent.

Wow! People these days are so lucky that they get to ask/say whatever they want. I am 27 &amp; have been married for 3 years. In 2012, a guy’s family came to my place to interview me. I was strictly instructed by my parents that I should tell them that I didn’t want to work &amp; have studied Engineering just to be well-educated (since the guy’s family wanted a well-educated house-wife). But, that wasn’t the truth. I was an ambitious girl &amp; really wanted to work. My conservative family was afraid that nobody in my community (Marwari) will marry me if I express my desire to work. In the past, I tried to r 

This one was the most awkward and weird one: A girl’s father was in the similar business which I am doing ( software development - Consulting work ) called up directly on my mobile… Uncle: I got your number from xyz..so I heard that you are in this business since 3–4 years. We are also doing the same since 15 years and I have offices in 3 countries etc etc ( 3–4 minutes speech) Me: great!

I had many informal meetings with her family, most of them were not planned ones. In the first meeting, I was told that her parents are in the vicinity to attend a marriage, and they would like to meet me. I frowned upon hearing it. “What girl, I didn’t come home to get married” Mom: “Ok, don’t marry, just put up a good face, they are here, we can’t return them from the gate”. I acted as asked. It was just a simple talk over a tea with some eatables between two families. Them: “What is the nature of your work?” Me: “I write softwares, primarily for mobile phone” One of Them: “Nice, my brother works at 

I am married to a Russian girl now but I had my share of ups and down in arrange marriage meetings, mostly downs. Anonymous because I am gonna say some bitter truths. So when I was 27 my mom was looking for match as she wants her son to settle down but what she wasn`t aware of is the girl`s high demands and unfair expectations. I have been in arrange meeting for marriage for almost 10 times to sum up the girl`s question in one line is “How much money do you have so that I don`t have to worry about anything for the rest of my life and you will call me your equal even though it is fairly evident  

Some of the questions I as a boy would like to ask are. (P.S.) I am just 22 and I never had experience of this. These are just my thoughts what I would like to know about her on first conversation. I guess before the meet I would be knowing about her education and work details so no question on that. Some of the question on first meet mainly to know about her and other deeper question relating to marriage would like to ask on second meet or after some friendliness. 1.)What kind of person are you? Do you like to spend time with less people or have so many friends( Just because some people like to k

Before you continue, I feel it's fair to mention that I am not just going to list the questions I asked or was asked. Its going to be more about how I answered those questions. She was the fourth girl I was meeting. It was a hopeless meeting I had thought. I did not have the slightest idea that my life was going to change forever, for the better. My negativity about that meeting was both due to my previous nagative experiences and the fact that I had not liked her in the pic. It was only due to pressure from my parents that I had agreed to meet her. We decided to meet at an ice cream shop near he

Going through our old pictures is always an emotional roller coaster to me. In fact, I am tearing up writing this.

But I didn’t find a way around lying to meet him. And after a while I got used to lying effortlessly without batting an eyelash.

I’d obviously said something that was “smart aleck” in this pic…which I KNOW she loved even though she pretended not to!

We were dating for so long and we had a great time no matter it was a long distance relationship. I used to travel all the way from Karnal to Mumbai, almost every month or two just to meet her. And that was the most beautiful phase. We both were in Mumbai, but still she was 3 hours away from me. I was staying a bit far from her and she never used to get up before 9 o'clock. All of a sudden she started getting up around 6 o'clock for me. Her parents were shocked to see such changes in her lifestyle, they were unaware about me at that time.

Starting with my Before-Marriage pictures: Feeling the cool breeze but all alone, with nobody to share the moment with.  Walking the paths all alone with nobody but a camera in hand, who has been my only friend over all these years.  Looking into the vast infinity, waiting for my dream-girl to arrive in bridal wear!   After Marriage:  Oops! Error 404: Marriage not Found! But I am in a healthy relationship with food if that counts?   Nah! With a lack of exercising, I think even that is becoming unhealthy day by day. 

It's actually a bit hard to find photos of us together. Either he's taking the pictures, or they're big group photos of my family. Here's us Christmas 2010 when we were just dating:  Proposal.

I love answering this kind of question, makes me smile to see the answers.. I met my husband in 2011, introduced by our friend..

What questions are asked during arranged marriage meetings in India?
Never faced these sort of situations till today in life but yes I have many sisters and have seen them go through this phase. None of my brothers have reached the age of getting married. So, no idea about boys. Disclaimer: This answer is on a light note. Ques. 1. What are your qualifications? ( I don't know why this question is asked. Though they come to her home after reading her bio-data thrice, still this question.) Ques. 2. Would you like to work even after getting married? This is a trick question and most of the things are judged on this. If the answer of girl is affirmative, then girl is calle 

Last month only I met this girl (it was my fourth arrange marriage meeting). Since first three are not worth discussing I am jumping to worth discussing one. I live in Delhi but my home town is in Madhya Pradesh. I am CA by profession and 29 by age. So was taking help of my parents in getting hitched as my relation didn`t worked out. My mom told me her friend`s daughter is a year less than you and looking for match I am sending you photos and bio. She seems decent. She was MBA so i was little hesitant (as their was a joke on my floor : either you marry a CA or you are getting Divorced and I have s 

Wow! People these days are so lucky that they get to ask/say whatever they want. I am 27 &amp; have been married for 3 years. In 2012, a guy’s family came to my place to interview me. I was strictly instructed by my parents that I should tell them that I didn’t want to work &amp; have studied Engineering just to be well-educated (since the guy’s family wanted a well-educated house-wife). But, that wasn’t the truth. I was an ambitious girl &amp; really wanted to work. My conservative family was afraid that nobody in my community (Marwari) will marry me if I express my desire to work. In the past, I tried to r 

This one was the most awkward and weird one: A girl’s father was in the similar business which I am doing ( software development - Consulting work ) called up directly on my mobile… Uncle: I got your number from xyz..so I heard that you are in this business since 3–4 years. We are also doing the same since 15 years and I have offices in 3 countries etc etc ( 3–4 minutes speech) Me: great!

I had many informal meetings with her family, most of them were not planned ones. In the first meeting, I was told that her parents are in the vicinity to attend a marriage, and they would like to meet me. I frowned upon hearing it. “What girl, I didn’t come home to get married” Mom: “Ok, don’t marry, just put up a good face, they are here, we can’t return them from the gate”. I acted as asked. It was just a simple talk over a tea with some eatables between two families. Them: “What is the nature of your work?” Me: “I write softwares, primarily for mobile phone” One of Them: “Nice, my brother works at 

I am married to a Russian girl now but I had my share of ups and down in arrange marriage meetings, mostly downs. Anonymous because I am gonna say some bitter truths. So when I was 27 my mom was looking for match as she wants her son to settle down but what she wasn`t aware of is the girl`s high demands and unfair expectations. I have been in arrange meeting for marriage for almost 10 times to sum up the girl`s question in one line is “How much money do you have so that I don`t have to worry about anything for the rest of my life and you will call me your equal even though it is fairly evident  

Some of the questions I as a boy would like to ask are. (P.S.) I am just 22 and I never had experience of this. These are just my thoughts what I would like to know about her on first conversation. I guess before the meet I would be knowing about her education and work details so no question on that. Some of the question on first meet mainly to know about her and other deeper question relating to marriage would like to ask on second meet or after some friendliness. 1.)What kind of person are you? Do you like to spend time with less people or have so many friends( Just because some people like to k

What are your before and after marriage photos?
Going through our old pictures is always an emotional roller coaster to me. In fact, I am tearing up writing this. Because I’m from a very conservative family, like many Muslim Arab families, I saw my husband in secrecy for around a year before they learned about him. I’ve always been an honest person to fault. But I didn’t find a way around lying to meet him. And after a while I got used to lying effortlessly without batting an eyelash. Then I realized that many times you think you can’t do something, or that you’ll never break your principles, but when circumstances demand it, you do it all li 

This is the earliest pic I have of ourselves together. It was in 1991 and we had been dating for a few months. I later proposed to her on our 2-year anniversary (In front of Big Ben in London) and were married on our 1,000th day together. I’d obviously said something that was “smart aleck” in this pic…which I KNOW she loved even though she pretended not to!  This is us taking a selfie at a beautiful windy spot near Page, Arizona just a few weeks ago. We will be celebrating our 26th wedding anniversary this October.  And these are our two teenagers trying to photo-bomb our selfie!  (without the beard 

Finally sharing a picture with my loving husband after so many request on my previous answer (pinned to my profile) :) BEFORE MARRIAGE-:  AFTER MARRIAGE:-  5 years of love and many more to come❤️ When we had our first talk 5 years ago, I did not even know that we would be married and later I realised to spend the rest of my life with this beautiful soul and finally, I got my man after crossing countless difficulties and challenges I did not even think in my dream that I would find such a loving person It is not just a matter of saying, I really cannot thank this man in words, nor can I describe the q 

We were dating for so long and we had a great time no matter it was a long distance relationship. I used to travel all the way from Karnal to Mumbai, almost every month or two just to meet her. And that was the most beautiful phase. We both were in Mumbai, but still she was 3 hours away from me. I was staying a bit far from her and she never used to get up before 9 o'clock. All of a sudden she started getting up around 6 o'clock for me. Her parents were shocked to see such changes in her lifestyle, they were unaware about me at that time. Now we use to laugh on such topics, it was this and that. T 

I have known my husband for a very long time now. We were childhood besties. 😬 The guy in the middle is my husband and the youngest dude is my brother - the shortest of us all! Yup - there was a time when I was a head taller than my husband!  This is when we actually started dating.  Then we got married!  More recent additions to the family. :)  Oh! The most recent one - once again with my husband, my brother and I on my brother’s wedding (Haldi ceremony)- this time I am the shortest and my brother the tallest. 😬  Thank you! 

Edit: Thank you everyone for your sweet, uplifting compliments! For those asking, no, my husband is not from India but is of Hispanic descent (Colombia). I myself have a huge variety of backgrounds, but my mother is from South America as well. To us, it doesn’t matter where we came from, it matters where we are and who we are. We believe everyone is created equal in God's eyes and that’s all that matters to us. ❤️ My husband and I have known each other for 13 years after meeting at our first job at an ice cream shop.

What are the weirdest reasons to reject a prospective bride/groom in an arranged marriage?
Few years ago, it was my first time the guy and his family had decided to visit our house for arrange marriage meeting. Everyone in my family were busy cleaning the house and getting things organized. Initially the guy’s family had planned to visit our house on Sunday at 4 pm but later guy’s dad called my dad at 1.30 pm, and asked if they can come to our house 2 hrs early at 2 pm. My dad agreed to it because he didn’t want to disrespect them by saying no. Only 30 mins were remaining. Me and my mom started to panic since lot of thing were pending to be organized. I got myself ready wearing a Sal 

It's a long story where rejection happens after marriage that leads to divorce and then a twist. If you can read completely then it's really nice. Me - A completely abnormal guy, Scientist, working in Defence organization, Hyderabad, Idli Lover, Gujarati, Jain, Not fair, Balding started, Muscular. So a Normal day, my parents told me about a girl which they searched from some matrimonial site. Her - Ambitious, Want to do MBA, Intelligent, Extrovert, Lots of friends, Good personality, Gujrati, Jain, Not working, Many other good things. First meeting - Went well. She said “ I want to do MBA but my pa 

Because I was too shy to open up with him on phone calls. (according to him) So, it goes like this. I am 24 years old girl and come from a moderately conservative family. As soon as I completed my masters, my parents started searching for “perfect match” to get me married. So, A couple of months ago, my parents made me meet a prospective groom. Since that was our first meeting, there were both our parents present around us, so we didn't get much to talk about and the meeting ended with some formalities. The day after that, my mum came to me and informed that the guy wanted to talk to me over the 

**Edited &amp; Comments Responded After having miserably failed with many romantic relationships… I finally relented to my parent’s wishes for an arranged marriage process. However before we discuss that a few details about myself. (Not boasting at all but just to give you context.) · Sex: Male · Age: Early 30s · Height: 6 feet plus · Work: in IT sector · Salary: 7 figures a year · Owns: Flat in city suburbs &amp; a car (All on EMI off course) · Family: Upper Middle Class family - Parents retired at prominent positions in service sector &amp; 2 younger siblings in equally well settled jobs. Given my decent credent 

I usually don't write answers in Quora but this question forced me to share my experience as I am suffering from this arrange marriage trauma from last 2 years. I am 29-year male and working in IT industry. Package is also not bad. Why I gave those details, reason is listed below. So far my experience is: 1. So the first girl which I met with one of the matrimonial sites was a business analyst. Her mother checked my profile in a matrimonial site. She called me and asked my parents contact number. I gave my parents number and my dad told girl mother, that let children talk first. We are just medi 

Don't know whether this will fit in, but yes. A very close friend of mine was meeting this girl. She was a doctor, working with a very big Hospital. My friend is a Chartered Accountant, with a decent job. He was excited to meet her, as they had been having conversations on whatsapp before. The families talked and met, and now it was time for the boy and girl to meet. My friend offered to pick her from her hotel and go for a dinner. However, she suggested to meet at a shopping mall. He reached there on time and waited at the food court. He wanted a quiet place, however was okay with the mall. She come 

I still remember it (probably will remember it for the rest of my life). It was a rainy day when they came home. He was everything I dreamt of - curly hair, very fair, handsome income and respectable family. As an added perk, he was intelligent and full of humour. My family liked him instantly and I was already over the moon. He flirted lightly with me when we were alone and I was already blushing when they left thinking about my days ahead in his company. Then the usual stuff started. Texting, adding on Facebook, chitchating on WhatsApp, occasional calls and café meet ups. The date for engagem 

I was to have marry a girl but then it turned out she liked anal sex and I couldn’t overcome my disgust. I knew she had had partners before me but anal sex! I think anal sex impurifies all of our precious bodily fluids and the passive partner is especially susceptible to this kind of impurification. For anal sex has always been forbidden and not without reason! That part of the body is supposed to eject waste matter and when we make it take a penis (or strap-on) we intervene in the natural order of things on the Earth. I loved her crazily and tried to cope with my disgust. But one night I had  

Usually in arranged marriage, the girl , the guy and their parents have a small talk to get to know each other and later girl and guy are let to have conversation in private. During this, I felt the guy's mom wanted a career woman and a maid. She stressed on how well I can handle household chores and my salary. As the guy didn't say anything in this regard, I didn't have the same judgement on the guy. In our private conversation, I could sense that he also had the same expectations. I wanted him to open up more on his ignorance of how the world has evolved and how women are breaking barriers ye 

A bit of background! I am a female from Delhi, India, age 32, introverted and reserved, working in IT sector, serious about my career, and, earns enough. What I seek for in my partner is a mature guy, who understands that making a career for oneself is as important for your partner as for yourself, because you both worked hard! So the search began after my breakup when I was 27, and, as per Indian standards I was anyway late for marriage, so, my family decided to seriously begin the search. Result, I had my profiles on Shaadi.com, Bharatmatrimony.com and Jeevansathi.com. I will be honest, th

Going through our old pictures is always an emotional roller coaster to me. In fact, I am tearing up writing this. Because I’m from a very conservative family, like many Muslim Arab families, I saw my husband in secrecy for around a year before they learned about him. I’ve always been an honest person to fault. But I didn’t find a way around lying to meet him. And after a while I got used to lying effortlessly without batting an eyelash. Then I realized that many times you think you can’t do something, or that you’ll never break your principles, but when circumstances demand it, you do it all li

What questions should a girl ask a boy during an arranged marriage interview?
There should not be any ‘questions’ that ‘should’ be asked. Try to have a conversation, get to know him as a person. The more you talk, the more you will get to know about his likes, dislikes, opinions. If it is not coming naturally, and you feel some factors are important for you to know in your partner, try to bring up topics related to those and gauge his opinion on it. Maybe on topics like spending habits, is he a miser or a spendthrift or likes saving. Getting to know such small things is more important than just knowing the broad topics like ‘hobbies’ or ‘income’ or profession. Knowing mo 

I don’t agree to ‘should’ here as there is no hard and fast rule. Based on my experience, I can say some. One of my closest friends recently had a conversations with the prospective guy. Some of the questions she had asked were extremely good and matured. As far as I remember, some of them were: How do you spend your money? Earning money is one thing, but how you spend it defines your lifestyle, sensibilities and personality. It is one of the best questions that reveals the inner-self of a person and his interests. What do you do when you are not working? This also reveals the interests of a person a 

What I have seen people asking is Education, hobbies, likes and dislikes. Hobbies, likes, dislikes will change with time and may be with the priorities. Most of people end up saying read, TV, movies. If you want to spend your life with someone, you want to know what makes them move, what aspires them, how they behave in a panic situation or any disturbing news/ events. What they dream about and why they want to be the person they dream of. Had asked the below few questions to a potential prospect, after few questions he commented ‘ Interrogation?’ When I told him, he can refuse to answer, he simpl 

You could ask several questions and see her response, what I am telling you is to focus on beyond her answers and words she speak. You can start your conversation with basic questions to ease the pressure, like her liking, her favorite food, what is her favorite time-pass, what does she do when she is bored, etc etc. What you are looking is her response , e.g. When you ask her favorite thing she does, when she is bored, if her response is singing/dancing/learning some thing creative that means she doesn’t like to sit idle and wants to keep her brain active all the time.Ask her who is her best fr

Thanks for the A2A. It’s not possible to know a person completely in just one meeting. You have to be selective and pick your priorities of knowing the person enough to see if you could take this conversation ahead with the person or not. Some questions that will help you go understand a person’s intellect, nature, depth are - Question:What is this guy most passionate about and what does he do for that? Intent: This will give you an idea of the level of determination, conviction the person has. If the person really likes something, what would he do for that.Intent: 80% of the times people end u

As per the survey done by zee news, majority of the girls or women in India preferred arranged marriage with parents consent than love marriage, they believe that their parents will not agree with a guy whom they loved or many of the reasons are there, I will not go in depth in these. But as per me, love marriage and arrange marriage both the scenarios are good, at the end what we should get is a perfect life partner which is actually fully not possible but at least the person who will understand each other properly and will support each other in any circumstances. It is not possible for any gir 

I feel most people have a wrong notion of what is an interview and how it should happen.If the questions to be asked are predetermined then you do not need an interview, you could as well hand it out as a questionnaire. Get the answers and coolly study the answers at home. Interview is not just questions and answers it is much more. I would ideally start with a simple question like tell us about yourself. The next question would be seeded from the answer to that question. I might even interrupt with permission and ask a short question about what he said. And then there would be a daisy chain of  

Men and women should get married, not girls and boys. Back to the question, a girl should ask the boy if he shares her dream. If it were for me, I’d ask him what are his views regarding my career and freedom. He strongly believes that as an educated working young woman, we should split the bills. In order for us to continuously do so, I need to be financially stable. That doesn’t mean I call up my parents for dowry. It means I have a career. What about kids, I asked. And he said, the one who is earning lesser should let go of the career and stay back at home. And I thought it was a good deal, as I 

Whatever you ask, there is no gurantee that other person is what he is saying. But some basic questions are: What are his/her hobbies- to know if they match yours or if a person is introvert or extrovertWhat is his or views on career or working women- required to know mindset of person and what are his/her expectations in future. For ex: a working women might want not to work after marriage and this happens. Or he is too career oriented and family life comes second in his priority.Do you want to live in a joint or nuclear family- A very important question- Some people are not meant for joint fa

It is not an examination. The information about the groom’s education and employment details would have been submitted to the girl’s parents. His conduct should be verified by the parents or through a reliable source. One must understand the personality of the groom by his body language. Even if the date of birth is already known just check if he is telling you the same date month and year. Compare it with his final year/ the year of passing out from the college. The name and location of the college and he was commuting to college. Then ask about his employment and timing of his working hours.

What was your most embarrassing moment as a newlywed couple in an arranged marriage?
There used to fall lot of moonlight in our balcony. It's the month of December. Very cold. We were married just one and half months back. I love to sit under moonlight. I somehow convinced my husband also to come out and sit. Though he too likes but hate chill weather and this is the peak winter here. I told him just for one hour we will sit. He reluctantly agreed. We were enjoying the moonlight with a tape recorder playing some songs. I arranged a complete set up to enjoy. We even finished our dinner. Our's is first floor. Ground floor people have one jasmine creeper Which climbed up to terrace 

Well, more than embarrassing, I would say this was a full on action adventure and scary as hell incident! So hang on guys and read on…. Being an arranged marriage, I hadn’t really been able to spend too much time (other than the usual phone chats) with my husband in person before our marriage. Me studying my Dental masters in a corner of the country and he working as a Doctor in another corner at the time of our marriage was to blame for this. Being short on leave from my college, we were quickly shipped off to a one week honeymoon trip to Kerala barely 3 days after our marriage. We were both aw 

“Don't underestimate the power of a loving Husband” We had an arrange marriage and a long distance courtship before that. So it was only after marriage that we were learning about each other and about ourselves. So two days into marriage, with our house still filled with guests, stealing a few moments alone was our only solace. And also because of the guests, I was expected to wear a saree and dress up every morning. I had seen my husband trying to steal a peak all morning. So before entering the shower, I told him that I needed “ His help” in draping my saree. I wouldn't have asked him for many  

I am a Marine Engineer by profession. My job involves sailing on crude oil tanker ships around the world 6 to 7 months at a stretch. The most common question asked to me is that whether I get sea-sick. My answer always is, ”Initially on the first ship I used to feel sea-sick but it became better on the subsequent ones”. And that was the truth until this happened: I got married at the age of 28. I already had more than 36 months professional sailing experience before I got married. I had an arranged marriage, me and my wife knew each other for 6 months before we read our vows. On our honeymoon we  

3 months into my arranged marriage. One fine weekend my husband decide to cook some root vegetable he bought from Wal-Mart. It tastes bit similar to potatoes if we boil them. We did DOSE that day and he cooked Baaji with this vegetable. It tasted little bit like potatoes so I asked my husband whether he added hing? He said No. I got worried a bit because I avoid foods like potato. It gives me Gas and if not cooked thoroughly my stomach would hurt sometimes. We eat breakfast at 8:45am. I felt that, this vegetable needed to cooked bit more.but it was tasty. At 11am I felt little uncomfortable. I dr

After marriage happened in bride parental home at next day , I was went with her in laws house as gaurd or companion of new bride. This is a custom in Bengali that a gaurd or companion will go with new bride from bride home. Next day there was reception from groom house. Day after reception, there was honeymoon 

Arranged marriage and embarassing moments go hand-in-hand right from the inception.. LITERALLY! Now, I did know my to-be husband since YEARS but preferred to maintain distance before getting married (just in case the fact that we resided in 2 separate part of the world wasnt enough). I am not typically shy but yes, after the ‘Qubool Hai’ and being decked up like its the last day of my life and being THE centre of attraction with everyone gauging at you.. i might have slipped into my most nervous self. My first embarassing moment was on the dining table when the all-shy-and-nervous bride forgets  

Well, this incident happened on the 2nd day of my wedding. All the rituals were done by then, and I had returned from my mother’s place to my in law’s home. Maybe it was around 8 pm. My husband had some commitments to be completed, so along with few other family members he had been to a place. That was around 2 hours journey. So my MIL insisted me to have dinner and sleep as he would be late. I had my dinner and slept in my new room ie my husband’s room. My MIL made sure that I was comfortable and she even suggested me to sleep with her until my husband returns back. I didn’t agree with her and

Before leaving, my partner had already indicated that there might be something bad that Dev could keep his belongings, so by the time I remembered her, all was right, but in the end, an incident made me enjoy the journey was spoiled. At this time my partner did not live in her house then she is a teacher in a school. So she  

We were visiting my wife's house and we stayed there for couple of days. On second day we were having sex and I always wanted to try anal but my wife never interested. So I just started normal way and move to doggy style after five minutes I just started putting some lubes in anal and my wife thought I was going to finger her ass while having sex. After 2–3 minutes my wife is really enjoying this style and I suddenly pulled out my thing and inserted into her anal in a quick forcing way. It got inserted but my wife simply cried loudly and her mom just came to our room and asked what's happened  

How long did it take you to fall in love in your arranged marriage?
Took us quite a long time, 3 YEARS! So here's how it all started, The topic of my marriage was always bought forth but my family didn't pay much attention to it. My uncles and aunties kept showing me pictures of NRI boys with huge income and good families, but I wasn't just ready. By this time I finished my post grad. and was 24 years old. That's when my aunt told us there's a guy and his parents want him married in the same year. I was not at all interested but thought let's at least meet. We fixed a meeting at my place, as soon as the guy entered I fell for him, a perfect lean body, a subtle smi 

20 Days! Yes, I whispered 'I love you' in his ears one night when we were at call. I, being a survivor of various abuse found peace in him. I, being deprived of true emotions always found love in him. I, being lonely all my life found a friend in him. After searching for a suitable life partner for almost two years, I almost gave up. Many guys rejected me because I wasn't as pretty as they desired for, some I rejected because I couldn't keep up with their thought process. One guy whom I liked a lot and waited for him for one and a half years, rejected me after meeting with me and then all hell broke  

Exactly 50 Days. We both were the member of one of the reputated matrimony site. I was inactive since 2-3 months. He was going through all the profiles. In matrimony sites, there are number pages of your suitable match, due to inactivation of my account my profile was on 7th page. He was about to close the account and by mistake he clicked on the 7th page (yes by mistake he did that) and found my profile. He expressed interest on me. After 7 to 10 days he didn't get any revert so he fond me on facebook. Amazing. After a normal intro via messanger we met with our parents at his home. It was 1st m 

I don't know. Mine is arranged marriage from my side. According to him I am born crazy. Since I was born at midnight calls me ‘raakshasi!’( devil) if I irritate him.

Though I don't belong to that class of people, it used to affect me alot.

I took around 1.5 year. It was a arranged marriage and my wife was living with me from day one. She is the kind of girl who always see the dreams of having an amazing husband, and will have lots of talks and all those fantasies. She was very reserved kind of person before marriage and didn't like to talk much to any boy or men, and didn't have any relationship. So, she was devoted completely for me from the very first day. But, I was in a relationship before marriage and had good time with my ex, so I was missing those beautiful moments, that amazing understanding, caring with my wife after marr 

A little background about my marriage just to make my story a little easier to understand. My marriage was 100% arranged . And whereas many arranged marriages have a process that includes meeting of the soon to be couple , a period of talking to each other , getting to know each other (kinda like dating but not really.) A process that may go well over a year , I married this woman knowing almost nothing about her , aside from what her sister told me about her(I've known my sister in law for a long time here in the USA .) Knowing absolutely nothing about this person , and trusting my sister in la 

Well in my personal perspective the question is framed in a weird manner. “How long did it take you to fall in love in your arranged marriage”. How will you fall in love in an arrange marriage is something that totally beats me, but that’s my opinion. People get used to the person with whom they are married via the route of arrange marriage. It might be very confusing and people can term it that they fell in love, but frankly people gets used to it so much, that you believe its love and you believe that you cant live without that person because that person has became a part of your routine. And 

Oh man! it was a long process for me. Some of my friends were really flabbergasted that I went for arranged marriage. My husband is 7 years older than me. I am a bubbly chirpy girl, he is a serious kind of person. Few days after our marriage, it was difficult for me to adjust but he made things easier. I didn't know how to act, always thought that I would make some mistake (I had never done house chores before), even worse was the expectations that people have when you are married, overnight, everyone expects you to be more mature and adjusting(hello, I have just left my territory and have ente 

I believe that you can't just pinpoint the exact time and minute as to when you will fall in love. I have a justification for that, because for example when you're with a person or see him/her you're instantly attracted to them (the generic term is ‘Love at first sight') but you don't fall in love with them unless you get to know them. Especially, for girls and boys of the modern era, we do not like the thought of marrying someone who we just met. I'm no stranger to that either but because of family pressure, I had no other choice. But I said yes on one condition that I'll search for the guy ( 

Yash Raj has done it! After reading some of the responses - I have to give it to Yash Raj. How long does it take to FALL in love? Try: “NEVER”. People just convince themselves that they have FALLEN after a while. If you spend time with anyone - not just your spouse - anyone - a friend, a stranger or whoever - after a while - you get accustomed to each other. If that person goes missing or away - you will miss that person. And because you realize how much void they have been filling (or both of you were filling for each other) you will develop a great appreciation. This has no romantic significanc 

Why is doing an arranged marriage becoming difficult?
Which is better: an arranged marriage or a love marriage?
Both can be successful. Though it mostly depends on person to person however normally most of the couple cannot be able to cope with or adjust with the circumstances and the situation becomes worse from bad. If we generally see the percentage of success, then it is said that arrange marriage are more successful than the love ones. In love marriages we need more patience because in this case both the partner knows each other quite well and for a long time. So, if any misunderstanding happens sometime in their life after marriage, both the partners don’t want to compromise generally and start bla 

It depends on the spouses. It is irrelevant whether it is a love or arranged marriage. Today marriages are very difficult to materialize for a variety of reasons, the most important being unrealistic expectations. And then to sustain the marriage to satisfactory levels is even more difficult. Then what is the solution? I feel that both men and women will start looking for satisfactory solutions to overcome the limitations of marriage. These solutions can be rather unconventional. Many people today are single for no fault of their own. Many of them with very good high paying jobs. The general trend  

Frankly, there is no difference at all! Because eventually, in both the cases, people manage to stay together and share the responsibilities. What actually matters is that, if Love happened. Let’s put it this way. Two people fell in love and they get married, but why is that the same couple would want to separate later? Let’s take another example. Two people who don’t have any idea of each other’s existence get married… why is that they choose to live together forever? Love becomes the reason for any split or patch. When two people are in love everything becomes easy. A relationship doesn’t look 

Arranged marriage or love marriage,which one is better? Actually,there is no correct answer because the answer is in everyone’s mind.You can toss a coin many times until you think the right answer appears. First of all, we should clarify our own standards about marriage.You can ask yourself a few questions.Why people get married?Is love important in my marriage?What is the value of marriage and what benefits it will bring me?After clarifying these questions, you will understand what you want better.

I would neither say arrange marriage nor say love marriage. It totally depends upon an individual's life and their own choice. And apart from choice destiny is something which plays a role secretly in everyone's life! See if any xyz person is in relation and wants to take it ahead they always try their own best. But many fail due to parents' pressure or cheat and many other reasons. If xyz person gets success getting married to his or her loved one. The issues won’t still stop such as hates from family. Many members not accepting the marriage and try to back bitch which can also affect the coupl 

When I was a teenager and started noticing girls I asked my dad “how do you know which girl to marry?” My dad thought about my question for a while and answered “you just know”. My dad was a wise man, I live and love by many of his morale codes but his answer remained a mystery to me for another decade. I grew up not knowing but waiting for that knowledge to come. I met many girls but none hit me as “the one” until I met this girl at a dancing class:  I must admit that it was her beautiful smile and skill on the dance floor that caught my attention. But I didn’t know she was “the one” right away. S 

Thank you for A2A. According to me from my personal experience, I would go for arranged marriage. There is a growing ‘bias’ tendency against arranged marriage among people. I am not against love marriage. The true scenario is that no one can predict the ending of both types of marriages. Both have failed in good number. But there are certain holds which is positive for arranged marriage. Arranged marriage involves the entire family, friends and relatives. The marriage itself will be like a festival. Everyone takes part and help each other for the arrangement. Everyone will be given a task as mar 

Let me give you few examples from my family and neighbourhood before we reach to any conclusion, a guy and a girl get married, and after some time, A husband slaps his wife because she accidently puts too much salt in food. When I talked to the wife she told this whole incident like it was normal occurence. Maybe it was!A wife didn't want to live with her in-laws so after so many fights her in-laws and wife,husband and kids started living separately in the same house. A husband can't do and say much because of his kids and living an unhappy life.A husband left his wife after 18 years of marriag

I was a very vociferous advocate for arranged marriages for a very long time. Probably this was because I have grown up in a family where 95% of marriages are arranged. The other 5% are scowled at for the rest of their lives. As I grew older and more mature, I am surprised at the way my thought process is also changing.  People seldom fall in love with each other the moment they set eyes on each other. Chuck the ‘love at first sight’ nonsense. That’s nothing but physical attraction. Love is a very deep and intense emotion and DOES NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT! It needs time to grow and get stronger. Most  

I think, if you try to understand and make a balanced decision, then Love marriages are 100 times better than arranged marriages. Why? Because of the following points: In case of Arranged marriages, you may likely to marry a person who loves actually another person of another caste, but because of the parent's pressure or some other reason agreed to tie a knot with an unknown person of same caste. In India, such things happens much more than love marriages, and it destroys 3 people, or at least two. It always remains as an unfulfilled desire of life, to marry a person one loved and loves to marry

Have you ever had a Quora crush?
Yes I have a major crush on a Quoran, though he is not much popular here. I would have written this answer without being anonymous, but uff he hates these type of answers and he would have reported it instead of replying. Okay so lets see who he is: He is 17 years old and he also has a blog.He lives in a stubborn illusion.He has such an unique name, so much so that many people report his account for fake name, ugh.His name means ‘Curious’.I don’t know why actually does he mentions himself as lunatic, I don’t think he is.He doesn’t follow back or reply to messages generally.

He is funny, outgoing, and he has something to say about most anything. When she clicks on his profile she discovers he's in the same state as her, only a 45 minute drive away.

Of course I have. I've had several. Some were age appropriate. Some were not. Some I've actively pursued. Some I haven't. My most recent Quora crush who I decided to pursue turned out to be a bust. She and I are not compatible… leastwise she's not willing to change for the likes of me so. But that's fairly typical of teenage girls now isn't it? This one woman on here who sort of found me to be attractive has stopped speaking to me even though I think she and I would have gotten along excellently.

When dating, especially online dating, how do I bring up that I'm a loser? I want to be honest but I don't want women to be turned off by the fact that I don't have a lot going for me.
What would you think if a friend (with whom there was never even a kiss) invited you to dine with her, reiterating several times that if it was late you could sleep with her?
Since I foster open communication among my social circle, including making safe spaces for people to say what they feel and to accept and give rejection gracefully, I would think that my friend is saying exactly what she means. Friends can have meals together. I frequently dine with my friends, even one on one (well, I did before the world ended, anyway). Friends can also crash at each other’s houses, especially if it’s late and there are long drives ahead. All my friends have a standing offer to crash at my place if they come all the way out to where I live and it gets too late to drive home, a 

Well I think maybe she's saying IF ITS TOO LATE YOU CAN SLEEP AT HER PLACE not necessarily with her UNLESS SHE VERBALY SAID “sleep with me in my bed “ So I'd think since your “friends “ who've never shared a kiss together I'd think right away (unless she clearly said “sleep with her in her bed “ I'd think she simply means To SLEEP IN HER HOUSE but necessarly with her in her bed .UNLESS SHE STATED IT IN A CLEAR AND CONSISE MANNER .Your default idea should be UNLESS SHE WAS CLEAR ABOUT WHERE YOUR SLEEPING IN HER HOUSE .the default would be since your friends Is that yes you'll sleep in her home  

I can see how that might be a bit confusing. I would say what she meant, but didn’t say clearly, is that if it gets late you can just stay over night there at her place. That’s it, sleep, nothing more. Think of it as, woman lingo. The moment I read what you wrote she said to you I thought of the many times my female friends have said the same to me. It’s a figure of speech not a sexual come on if that’s what you’re wondering. I’m 99.9&amp;1/2% sure that I am correct in my interpretation. HOWEVER, there’s always that possibility that I could be wrong. If I am wrong and it gets late &amp; you decide to sta 

If there are no romantical feelings towards each other, I would think that she just wanted company for dinner and it f I was to sleep with her, then nothing sexual would be taking place ( because that IS possible) and also by her saying repetitively about sleeping with her, I would think she had too much to drink. However, sounds like she has been thinking about you as more than a friend for some time. She mentioned you sleeping with her lots of times because she was trying to read your thoughts on sleeping with her. If you weren't such a gentleman, you prolly could have slept with her that nig 

Sleep with her or sleep over? How long have you known this friend? Has she ever flirted with you or do you get the feeling she's into you more than just a friend? Is she attracted to men? If she said “sleep with me" than that's pretty direct. There's nothing to read into because literally that means sleep with me. If she said sleep over then I could see why you maybe reading into her words. The friends I have invite me &amp; my husband out to their place and typically if it's late they let me know that if we wanted/needed to we could spend the night. (Unless they already specified otherwise that I c 

I’d think that sounds nice. I like my friends, and a dinner and a sleepover sounds lovely, I’d almost certainly accept unless the proposed time crashed with something else on my calendar. There’s some chance that the friend in question has an interest in adding a romantic and/or sexual component to our relationship, how likely this is would depend on what our interactions are like in general though, and not just on this one invitation. (Whether or not I’d want that, would depend on how I feel about the friend in question.) Generally there’s open and honest communication between me and my friends 

Not crash — but sleep over? I think she’s far More than hinting that she like-likes you. Here’s a litmus test: Pretend you have a serious GF. Would your GF be OK with any of this? No? Why? Yah, becomes quite clear, doesn’t it? :) She’s asking for you to sleep in the same bed with her — she invited you over to eat at her place 1-on-1. She obviously at least wants you to want her. If you’re attracted to her — make a move. It’s quite obvious. She’s putting the writing on wall quite clearly. Which means even if she’s kinda screwball in the head and just wants you to want her and if/when verified she’ 

Maybe she's conveying something sneakily, but as a male, please don't take first step without getting a straight answer. Especially in such affairs which requires getting close. If she likes you, wants to go wild with you, let her say it straight forward. If you like her, express it in a friendly, decent and in a safe way possible. Let her pick up the hint, take you to bed and take it to next level. If she doesn't initiate, then just enjoy the dinner, thank her for hosting and go back to your home like a Good kid 😁 11 views · Answer requested by Michael RighiWilliam Deemer, Counsel men &amp; women on relationships for a decadeAnswered March 23, 2021 · Author has 57 answers and 25K answer views

Like many of the other posters, there’s a lot of gray area here that would need to be elaborated on to give the best answer. From what I can glean, you are just good friends and she wanted to have dinner with you and politely offered you a place to stay in case things got too late or you had too much to drink. Very few women I know, and I mean I don’t think I’ve ever met one, repeatedly tell me that if it gets a little late they’re going to “sleep with me” meaning have sex with me. Trust me most men would drag the evening out as long as possible. I’m pretty sure she was just referring to letti

Would you date a guy with chest hair?
Why does a woman who has rejected you twice say "You are the most terrific guy. Any woman would be lucky to be with you."? Why doesn't she jump on the opportunity herself and why is she BS'ing me when she knows I'm not interesting enough for her?
The first and most obvious reason is that she is trying to ease any pain of rejection you might be feeling. That's considered polite, so if nothing else, that would be enough reason. Of course, she might also be sincere when she describes you as a terrific guy and a good catch, though obviously not ANY woman would be lucky to have you. She, for instance, would not be lucky to have you — she would likely be unhappy if she was stuck with you. That doesn't mean you're not “terrific.” A man or woman can have plenty of terrific qualities and yet not be right for a specific partner. You could be kind,  

I’ve gotten that a lot in my life. In my younger days, it was a source of frustration for me, so I understand why you feel put off by it. I used to joke that I’m the perfect guy for every woman’s best friend. But I’ve actually made a number of good female friends who started out as a date that didn’t go anywhere. It is quite possible to really like someone and think they are great without being romantically inclined toward them. And I’ve found that, if I put the whole romance thing out of mind, strong friendships can form. It always hurts to be rejected, but you can reframe it in your mind as a 

She probably does sincerely believe you're a terrific guy. That part doesn't have to be BS. The second part, “Any woman would be lucky to be with you,” is BS, however. If it were true that any woman would be lucky to be with you, she would be with you, and count herself lucky. The truth is, “Any woman who is attracted to you and compatible with you would be lucky to be with you, because you would treat her well.” But she probably lacks the awareness and precision to say that, so she falls back on a cliche. A sensible person chooses a partner based on a mixture of attraction, compatibility, and q 

I don’t know you or the woman in question, so I have no idea whether she really believes you’re a wonderful guy or whether she just THINKS she’s being nice and letting you down easy. Maybe she really thinks you’d be perfect for some other girl, or maybe she’s just trying to get rid of you without causing a scene. But ultimately, it doesn’t matter. You have been given the brush off. It hurts when a woman you love doesn’t feel the same way about you. But now you know: she isn’t interested in you as a boyfriend. So, forget about that and move on. Should you be “just friends”? That’s entirely up to  

About 45 years ago, a woman to whom I was deeply attracted explained that while I was her dear friend, romance wasn’t there. She thought I was likely to be a great husband, but not for her.

It’s called “letting you down easy.” There are lots of reasons why someone might reject someone, and we couldn’t possibly know her reasons.

People whine about “the friend zone,” but really, being a friend is a good thing, if you can handle it. If you can’t, well, that’s nothing to be ashamed of.

I was happily “married” (not legally, but in very other way) to another man, but § and me “clicked” mentally. I introduced § to my husband - they became friends. § met a woman (¥) I befriended her. It is now 30 years later. § still rings me up once a week for “a nice chat”. That girlfriend (¥) is still his girlfriend, even if she is now 77 years old. $ is a terrific guy. Any woman would be lucky to be with him. But “sexually attractive” he is not. Even  

The flattering reason for this is that she's aware that you'd objectively be "a catch" she just doesn't seem to be attracted to you because attraction doesn't function as a checklist. So "It's not you, it's me!", go and find the one/s you'd be perfect for! The less flattering reason (possibly likely, since she's rejected you twice and you're still arguing about it) is that women and girls get heavily socialised not to hurt the feelings of boys and men, so this tends to mean a "No" is couched in indirect and kind terms. This is partly because they get told not to be a bitch, and partly because t 

There could be a lot of reasons for that statement. Ultimately, she's not into you for whatever reason and you need to let it all go. Women are individual and each wants different things. You likely don't fill her wants/needs as they are right now. There are a lot of reasons for that. It could just be timing. Maybe you are the man of her dreams but she wants something else now. I doubt that, but fact is, you just don't know. Take her words to heart and believe you are a terrific guy and find someone who sees that and wants it. Obviously for whatever reason, you need to move on and she's trying  

People feel what they feel. I can objectively look at someone and say, “that person has the right kind of personality, sense of humour and ambition that I'd think they’d make a good partner”… but if I’m not attracted to them, it’s all meaningless. Either there’s a spark or there’s not. In my past I *wished* I was attracted to certain people because they would have been better choices for me but attraction simply doesn’t work that way. Attraction is involuntary. It’s not something anyone can control. She doesn’t feel it for you. She’s not BS’ing you, she’s actually complimenting you while at the sam 

I am getting angry right now. What should I do if a Korean girl wont date me? 😡
I am getting angry right now. What should I do if a Korean girl won’t date me? Calm down and leave the girl alone. There’s probably a reason why the girl doesn’t want to date you. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t find you attractive. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t like your personality. Don’t take it personally; after all, not everyone’s going to like you back. But if you only want to date a Korean girl because she’s Korean, then that’s just plain stupid and it makes sense why Korean girls wouldn’t want to date you. You’re literally fetishizing them.

Highly likely, koreans are an extremly racist nation towards every non-korean, other asians can melt in easier because they are the same race so they have more similar features. If anything, koreans have an OBSESSION towards pale porcelain skin, so that should tell you enough, they bleach themselves and use skin moisturizers and sunscreens that are “skin whitening”, if you are here and look around you will see thousands of plastic surgery clinics being promoted by caucasians, since its not only the white skin but they also take surgeries to get almond shape eyes, higher and pointier noses, sli 

Imagine a woman who you are not attracted to in the least, demands that you date her, and when you decline her offer, she becomes furious with you. You would think she has serious anger issues, you would be thankful that you avoided her, and she is a jerk. EVERYONE of us has liked someone who has not liked us back. Each of us has the right to say no, no matter how much the other wants to date. That is how it goes. You will survive this. Show her kindness, leave her alone, and take some time to figure out why you are becoming so angry. Only you can change this about you. It is not their responsib 

I don’t know who you are or what you look like or if you’re male or female, but just maybe to them you smell bad, maybe they think you’re ugly, very possibly they just don’t like you or think you’re an idiot…you just may want to find out before going any further…In any case, if you want to have a girl friend or boyfriend who is Asian, I would suggest that you learn the language and their customs and then try again, or just try other Asian communities, and if that doesn’t work, try finding one on an Asian dating site…and if that doesn’t work, then I’d just forget finding an Asian mate and settl 

Learn to not! It's most likely an indication you are not happy with yourself. Let her go! Now work on yourself. You are mostly perpetuating the problem. You need to be okay with rejection and be positive about what you do have. A bit of gratitude goes a long way. So what do you enjoy doing? Go do that and let her go! There is more to life that expecting people to fall at your feet. Just you do life and if she doesn't want to part of it..her loss.

mainly, no offense but this is true, Korean families only look in people for their good jobs and their income like a doctor who makes 200k a year they would consider them a part of the family but if not you know they would just dump you. This wouldn’t be an offense because back then in ancient times they believed in power and wealth also mainly if you don’t respect the Korean culture and you don’t approve the eating ways then that’s a reason why they don’t want to date you and also begging and forcing wouldn’t make it better. 83 views4Cynth GrehnAnswered March 23, 2021Originally Answered: I am lonely and angry.

I saw this question/vent like for so many times and I assume you’re the same guy. Listen, first off if you’re in Korea, try dating apps. It might probably help you. I mean don’t lose hope, there are many half Koreans and half black kids so there might be a chance you’ll find one. It might take some luck or timing as well. Or just accept that korean girls might not be for you but you can try other asian girls that has a resemblance of korean girls features. Good luck and take break too. 84 views · View upvotes2Michael SchabowAnswered March 22, 2021 · Author has 894 answers and 132.2K answer views

Are you angry or frustrated? Deal with “you” first. Sit down and make a list of all your good characteristics, and then a list of all your bad characteristics. Think how you can make your “bad” list shorter. If you are enjoying yourself and life, then the girls will be attracted to you. But you must learn to be patient.

I wonder if you’re that same guy that said that Korean girls won’t date them because of their race? I guess it’s because those girls that you are desperately wanted to date refuse to date you because they’re scared of you or because they’re not ready to be in an interracial relationship with you. 69 views · View upvotes4AnonymousAnswered March 23, 2021Originally Answered: I am lonely and angry.

What should I do? My GF is saying that either we get married or she will dump me. We have a 7-year relationship but I'm still not ready to get married. I love her but she is leaving me unless we arrange a wedding in the next 3 months.
Every relationship gets to a point where you decide to get married or break up. Both of you need to break up. I was in your girlfriend’s shoes. Thankfully I wasted 2, not 7 years of my life with a guy. Those types are never serious nor ready for that level of commitment but too scared of being alone. Same thing; had the DTR with him. Later he surprised me with a beautiful proposal, but shortly after, the engagement was extremely stressful; nothing changed. One day he’s like yes let’s get married and next day oh I’m not sure. It was exhausting. Wedding planning helped me get away from that stress  

Been married several times and I’ve got to give you two ends of the spectrum. On one hand, marriage is for suckers. I mean you’ve been with her for 7 years. What have you not done that you can only do in a marriage? File joint taxes? Guarantee each other’s inheritance? Visit in the hospital? Get on the other’s insurance plan? All stupid reasons to get married. You mentioned something about different countries? Immigration is actually a good reason to get married. Other than that, a cynic would say it sounds like she’s got other plans for you or your fortunes. He’d say “If I was in your shoes, I’ 

My grandma had a saying for this. “Shit. Or get off the pot.” If you don’t know that you want to marry a woman after 7 years (!) of being in a relationship, then you need to figure out your mind and fast. I told my (now) husband after less than a year of dating that I was going to have to make a job decision in the next few months. I needed to have a firm decision from him on whether or not we were going to get married or not before I decided to stay where we were living at the time or move back to be closer to my family. I was not staying without a ring on my finger, or at least a firm propos 

Your gf said that to you? You mean your “girlfriend”? 7 years, and she's still your “gf”. Wow! Seven years she's been acting like your wife, you've been treating her like a wife. Sleeping in her bed each night, nursing you through sickness, washing your clothes, sucking your dick…. 7 fuckin' years you've been sucking the youth out of her and you don't respect that woman enough to ASK HER to honor you by becoming your wife.., and she wants to get married. She should have left you a long time ago. You are abusive and self-centered. If after 7 years you “are not ready”, then you really need to give her 

I had a fiancé just like you. He wasn’t ready after many years, almost 7. I one day got sick of his not being ready to just grow up and figure out what he wanted in life and I left him. Two years later (after being with HIM for 7) I was not only married, I was pregnant. No joke. So all these years later, I am happily married to someone else with a child. Coincidentally, my ex-fiancé lives 7 blocks from my new house. We stayed friends on FB, and I got a little concerned about the fact that we both live in the same small town. I looked up his address, wanting to be sure I wasn’t going to run int 

Wow this sounds familiar. I also had a 7-year relationship, in which she wanted to get married and I “wasn’t ready to.” I have to say, your girlfriend is being pretty kind, respectful, and vulnerable to express her needs to you. My girlfriend simply got frustrated, and ended the relationship. In fact, I think most women would just leave. What you have to understand is that your girlfriend loves you, but she also has important life goals which include marriage and probably family. These are very important to her. What you should ask yourself is “Why am I not ready?” For me, there were some important as 

This is a tough &amp; hard question to answer since so many variables can affect you &amp; your decision so I’m just going to try and do this on a basic and “Man to Man” kind of talk. As you’ve said, you have a 7 year long relationship and I will presume that you &amp; her are “In Love” , that you both do truly care for one another and enjoy time spent with each other and consider the past 7+ years a good investment of time. You then need to ask yourself “Why am I not ‘Ready’ for Marriage”? What is holding you back ? What are you afraid of ? What else do you feel you need to do before you feel like you wil 

I knew a guy once that was in a 5 year relationship but he just wasn’t ready to “settle down”. I talked with him a bunch of times about it because he was such a nice and kind guy and the girl was the love of his life and he would only ever get married and have children with her, he said. He couldn’t explain why not now. She was patient and seemed to be okay with the arrangement though. Fast forward 6 years. Whatever barrier makes the thought of being committed so impossible to him has not diminished. She is now in her late-ish 30s and he knows she wants kids. So he tells her she should forget h 

This is such a great question and I’m so glad you made the decision to ask it. NEVER let someone pressure you into marriage! PERIOD! Marriage is a TREMENDOUS commitment and an AWESOME responsibility! If you are not ready, you are NOT READY! NO ONE should pressure someone into marriage and, quite frankly, no one should WANT to pressure someone into marriage! People who want to get married, but are with a partner who feels they are not ready, can ALWAYS leave and go meet someone else, but NO ONE should ever pressure someone into getting married! Let me offer you some thoughts. Many women and men  

Generally, I think giving ultimatums are distasteful. However, context matters, and in the context of a 7 year relationship, I don't think its particularly unreasonable. What you need to do is to be honest with yourself. Question 1: Do you want to marry her? Possible answers: No. If this is your answer, I think its obvious that you have an irreconcilable difference. Your relationship is over, maybe it even lasted too long. You have to accept this and move on, and allow her move on.Maybe/I'm not sure. If this is your answer, we'll come back to that shortly.Yes, but not in 3 months. This also requir

How do married people stay in love with their spouse when they are old, wrinkled, and grey?
I’m not quite wrinkled yet but I’m definitely past mid-life so the grey hairs have well and truly taken over. My husband and I have now reached the point where we’ve been together longer than we’ve lived apart. We met in Santorini, Greece, a few decades ago, when neither of us were necessarily looking to fall in love. He was on his way to Gallipoli to visit his great grand-father’s grave, while I had just finished university in France and wanted to spend the rest of my summer in Greece. He was the first person I remember meeting on my second day on the island. I suppose everybody was new and i 

Hmmm… let me try to answer this. When I first met my wife I thought she was crazy beautiful. I was not, however, in love with her. I didn’t know her but saw her from afar. To me she was like beautiful art. Truly gorgeous. Then I got to know her. We became best friends first. No sexual relationship. Just friends. I then learned that she was truly beautiful inside also. This is why I began to fall in love with her. It was not because of her looks, it was because of the person she is. So now we have been married for 27 years. Perhaps she is not as physically beautiful as she was back then. She is, h 

If you marry your spouse of the same age give and take about five years different then you will grow old together.

I can only speak for myself and not for old, married couples. I’m still young and unmarried, but here’s my input anyway. I do not plan to marry any woman for her physical appearance. I want a woman with a certain type of personality and mindset. Physical appearances change over time, but good personalities can remain the same or even improve as spouses grow older. I will always associate my future wife’s physical appearance with her positive qualities which I’ll greatly treasure for life. When she’s old, wrinkled and grey, we will have spent so much time together and experienced so many positiv

You begin by choosing your partner wisely. You don't settle. You must ask yourself: Is this person the love of your life? Is this person someone you find difficult to be apart from? Is this someone who compliments you and your lifestyle? I've heard people say about the companion they're with, “She's (or he's) a good person.” Yes, that's all well and good, but it's not enough. Do they light a fire of passion within you? Do you find it hard to keep your hands off them? Next month, my wife and I will celebrate 47 years of marriage, although we've been together a lot longer having met when we were 

Being in love isn't the same thing as being in lust. All people get old and grey if they are lucky, there is no avoiding that. There is also no human right that states that we all deserve to be with someone that stays hot for their entire life. Doesn't it sound silly to expect that when you think of it that way? Everyone would be single, that's not even feasible. When you love someone, you like their personality and being with them. That doesn't necessarily go away. If you were attracted to them in the beginning, that attraction is strengthened by love. An old grey husband still looks like his y

What makes a man fall in love with a woman?
What happened in that moment when you realized you are in love with your significant other?
I was friends with my boyfriend for a year before we got together. We talked every day. We went out together. We laughed together. I loved him - as a friend. Four days after we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend, exactly one month ago, I had a date night planned with him, but his roommate got sick, and we had to cancel. I was in the middle of moving into my flat, and had no furniture, food, or stuff to do. He stopped by at lunch time with pizza, flowers, strawberries, and ice cream. We ate, using a moving box as a table. We cuddled on a blanket on the floor. He told me I was beautiful, cal 

When I realized that I was in too deep. We started dating during my senior year and his first year of college after knowing each for three years. I had been single for a long time with the intention that I was not going to continue dating just to prove that I was worthy of having a boyfriend. Sure, dating happened, but the other parties knew that they would not become my significant other. He wanted a relationship with me and was forward about it, clearly stating his intentions. That got my respect and I told him that we could explore our options and if a foundation existed for trust and respect

My ex, who I lived with during that time in New Orleans, Louisiana I had caught cheating and needless to say I was in pretty rough shape.

Thankfully the drive back home gave me much needed time to think and process what had happened but the one thing that I kept coming back to was being excited to be going back home.

We never dated, but we knew we were friends who also had feelings for each other that weren't platonic. We blamed it on teenage hormones for a long time.

The day I heard that coy girl speak for the first time, I loved it. That was the day I took up that botched up mission of asking for her notes, ended up asking her equally pretty friend.

My boyfriend and I have been in love for eight years, we had sweets and quarrels, but we are still loving. This period requires long-term effort, time and sincerity. Looking back, I have these suggestions in my relationship that I want to tell you, and I hope it will help you. 1. Give each other appropriate space and trust.

Ask yourself if being lonely is someone else’s problem or just yours. Furthermore, even if you settle you may still feel lonely afterwards. And what about not having to work and just stay at home? This sounds cozy, but does it take all da

I hope that I don’t come across as too self-aggrandising, but the best relationship advice that I ever received was probably from myself. I had stayed in relationship for too long with someone who treated me appallingly as she felt that she was too good for me. She also told me on numerous occasion that she was embarrassed to be with me as she felt that she could do so much better and to twist the knife she told me a lie story that everyone had said the same to her. I’m no psychologist, but I should hazard a guess that this was either to mask her own deep rooted insecurities, or would say these

Reason for you is that he is seriously planning for your future, and he hopes to create the future with you. 4. Material is not the most important factor in emotion, but it must exist. 5. Most of the pain in love comes from three expectations: He must be th

Sure, it might work for a while but eventually all of the differenc

Women are motivated by love and feeling cherished, men are motivated by respect and feeling needed.When a woman is having a rough day and is opening up to you, don’t immediately give advice. Women open up because they want men to listen.When a woman says: “You never care”, “You never make me happy”, “You never apologize”. She doesn’t literally mean that you never do any of these, this is just how she expresses her feelings in the moment, so take it easy and don’t get defensive.Men sometimes demand the right to have some space from time to time and not to continuously express their feelings whe

This was a long time ago when I was still young and always got caught looking at girls. Like father like son I guess. One day I was staring at this girl who is now my fiance and decided to go talk to her and I just directly told her that she looks fine as hell today and she was a shy girl and she just turned red and said thank you. I told her “did you like when I told you that?” and she just nodded. I told her “honestly I like you more than other girls here, you actually look cute” she turned even more red and I told her goodbye. My friend just stared at me and said “did you seriously just say 

What was the best relationship advice you ever got?
My boyfriend and I have been in love for eight years, we had sweets and quarrels, but we are still loving. This period requires long-term effort, time and sincerity. Looking back, I have these suggestions in my relationship that I want to tell you, and I hope it will help you. 1. Give each other appropriate space and trust.  You need a space to enjoy yourself, drink afternoon tea with your girlfriends or go shopping together, and boys also need time to simply play games and exercise with their brothers. You don't need to know exactly what he is doing all the time. You can sublimate yourself in thi 

This is from my (female) experience (top 5): DO NOT SETTLE: Why? Because if you do, you are telling yourself this is the best that is out there and you don’t deserve better. You are also saying, if I settle, at least I won’t be lonely, don’t have to work, can just stay home, take care of the kids, feed the pets, or finally have some financial security. Really? Ask yourself if being lonely is someone else’s problem or just yours. Furthermore, even if you settle you may still feel lonely afterwards. And what about not having to work and just stay at home? This sounds cozy, but does it take all da

I hope that I don’t come across as too self-aggrandising, but the best relationship advice that I ever received was probably from myself. I had stayed in relationship for too long with someone who treated me appallingly as she felt that she was too good for me. She also told me on numerous occasion that she was embarrassed to be with me as she felt that she could do so much better and to twist the knife she told me a lie story that everyone had said the same to her. I’m no psychologist, but I should hazard a guess that this was either to mask her own deep rooted insecurities, or would say these  

Here are some suggestions that I have practiced, which are very useful. In China, interpersonal relationship can even be regarded as a science. With the change of young people's ideas in the 21st century, we are pushing China's interpersonal relationship to become more modern and more bordered. Asians born before the 21st century should attach great importance to the order of the young and the old, especially Koreans. China pays more attention to family relations, visiting each other and giving gifts on holidays. Especially Mid-Autumn Festival, Dragon Boat Festival and Lunar New Year. Chinese frien 

The most shocking realization of an idealist cinephile: Life is not like in the movies I stood there patiently waiting for love to find me, with popcorn in my hand and the heart on my sleeve. I did everything right, according to every script I ever saw. I had my fair share of drama, gave away second chances like free coupons, paired efforts with compromises and loved foolishly. Movies taught me about love. They cemented a predefined vision of love that was impossible to shake off later in life. Every relationship I’ve embarked on followed a playbook I knew to be true and that went a somewhere al 

Love yourself first.Don’t talk about your ex. Please don’t. What’s in the past stays in the past.Don’t rush things. Be slow and let time show you the next step.Never get involved in a relationship just because of pressure. Some people try to hold on a relationship until they find something better, or feel they can change the other person to fit what they want. Chances are high that this isn’t gonna work and you will hurt their feelings later.Never date someone after a breakup. You don’t know if he chose you because of love or obviously because he wants to forget his ex.When a woman ask you a q

hi everyone. I would like to share some advice about relationships I have sum up today ,hope you guys will like it. 1. It's not age that brings you into marriage, it's love. 2. Always keep 20% mystery. Unreserved women, like a movie that has been spoiled, snuffed out the idea of letting men see the ending. 3. Cherish the boys who reason with you. Reason for you is that he is seriously planning for your future, and he hopes to create the future with you. 4. Material is not the most important factor in emotion, but it must exist. 5. Most of the pain in love comes from three expectations: He must be th 

This is what I've learnt over the past 8 years of my life Date with a purpose. Even if you're dating just to have sex, let your intentions be loud and clear. In the end the other party can never accuse you of wasting their time.Take time for yourself after a breakup. Finding another mate to help you “forget" your troubles might work temporarily but you'll only end up in furthur problems and end up hurting the other person along the way.If you know what you're looking for in a partner don't get sidetracked and date the opposite. Sure, it might work for a while but eventually all of the differenc

Women are motivated by love and feeling cherished, men are motivated by respect and feeling needed.When a woman is having a rough day and is opening up to you, don’t immediately give advice. Women open up because they want men to listen.When a woman says: “You never care”, “You never make me happy”, “You never apologize”. She doesn’t literally mean that you never do any of these, this is just how she expresses her feelings in the moment, so take it easy and don’t get defensive.Men sometimes demand the right to have some space from time to time and not to continuously express their feelings whe

This was a long time ago when I was still young and always got caught looking at girls. Like father like son I guess. One day I was staring at this girl who is now my fiance and decided to go talk to her and I just directly told her that she looks fine as hell today and she was a shy girl and she just turned red and said thank you. I told her “did you like when I told you that?” and she just nodded.

What happened in that moment when you realized you are in love with your significant other?
I was friends with my boyfriend for a year before we got together. We talked every day. We went out together. We laughed together. I loved him - as a friend. Four days after we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend, exactly one month ago, I had a date night planned with him, but his roommate got sick, and we had to cancel. I was in the middle of moving into my flat, and had no furniture, food, or stuff to do. He stopped by at lunch time with pizza, flowers, strawberries, and ice cream. We ate, using a moving box as a table. We cuddled on a blanket on the floor. He told me I was beautiful, cal 

When I realized that I was in too deep. We started dating during my senior year and his first year of college after knowing each for three years. I had been single for a long time with the intention that I was not going to continue dating just to prove that I was worthy of having a boyfriend. Sure, dating happened, but the other parties knew that they would not become my significant other. He wanted a relationship with me and was forward about it, clearly stating his intentions. That got my respect and I told him that we could explore our options and if a foundation existed for trust and respect 

I had just gotten back from being away from home for about 10 months. My ex, who I lived with during that time in New Orleans, Louisiana I had caught cheating and needless to say I was in pretty rough shape. I was very confused, very hurt, and so very tired from being up for 48 hours. Thankfully the drive back home gave me much needed time to think and process what had happened but the one thing that I kept coming back to was being excited to be going back home. Despite being in that state my thoughts always strayed back to my best friend and I couldn’t contain the feeling of being absolutely e 

If you were to die tomorrow, I would treasure these two amazing dates we’ve shared. And, if you were to die in a month, I would have had a month to get to know you. And, if you were to die in six months, I would have had the chance to fall in love with you. Anything after that is icing on the cake. Those were the words she used to tell me that she was comfortable dating a man with late-stage cancer. Here we are. This photo sits in a frame at the top of the stairs to our second-floor living room, in our home.  In May of last year, I was in dating mode. I had a profile on a few dating apps, and I ha 

I've known my boyfriend since I was twelve years old. We were friends for a year or two, then we started to be friends who held hands, and then friends who kissed, and as we got older our relationship just kept changing. We still talked about history, watched Hank Green videos together, and fought over the proper way to solve social justice issues, but we physically started to be closer. We never dated, but we knew we were friends who also had feelings for each other that weren't platonic. We blamed it on teenage hormones for a long time. Sometimes we would stop doing our friends with benefits 

I had known my husband for 6 years before he finally asked me out. There was an opportunity where we were both single and finally set our sights on each other. I had gotten my wisdom teeth surgically removed the morning after our first date. I developed serious dry socket infections in all four gaping wounds in my mouth where the teeth were dug out. It was the most painful and horrible experience of my life up to this point. Childbirth didn’t even come close. My mom was looking after me in the days following my surgery. I couldn’t function from the pain, couldn’t get out of bed, and I kept throw 

The first time I saw her…well, our eyes didn’t meet, I was straining to catch some more subtle elements. Her thick wavy hair won’t permit, they sheathed most of her face. Some days later, our eyes met. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I was transfixed for a little longer than normal. She claims to have no memory of it though. The day I heard that coy girl speak for the first time, I loved it. That was the day I took up that botched up mission of asking for her notes, ended up asking her equally pretty friend. I quickly transformed from an insignificant-nobody to a buffoon, that wasn’t funny at al 

Ours was a complete arrange marriage. During our 10 months of courtship (a long distance one) though we got along well but I was not entirely happy with the course of our relationship. It was not anything even an inch similar to what it is shown in movies or I have seen happening with my cousins and friends, where the two people either since day 1 or sometimes later are in head over heels love with each other. I even confronted him regarding my insecurity to which his reply always remained the same, he constantly made me understand that we are living apart and contacting over texts/phones so th 

When i realized i actually wanted to do things with him, when i was willing to put in effort. Before my current boyfriend and i began seeing each other in December’s 2018, I was having a rough year. Had just graduated high school, had spent 10 months of that year in an unhappy relationship where i was abused, undermined, and ignored. I finally told my ex to hit the road when our 3 year anniversary had rolled around and I was drunk 3 hours away from his university. It was a difficult breakup. He stalked me for months after.

I missed her. We were friends for years, having met in church. I always got the feeling that she liked me, but she drove me crazy. We kind of drove each other crazy, actually. We were asked to lead church events together, because we were good at it, but that often led to fights because she had trouble seeing how often I had the correct perspective on things… :-) She was about as different from me as anyone could be, so if there were two ways to do something, guaranteed we each chose a different way. We had lots of fun dates over the years with our other friends, just casual stuff. Game nights, di

Can you really find love again after you broke up with someone who you thought was “the one”?
